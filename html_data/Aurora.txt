Burch, an editor and publisher\nof Holocaust and Nakba poetry\n\nI dedicate the poems on this page to the victims and survivors of the Aurora \nshootings, most of whom were in their teens or twenties. One victim, Veronica \nMoser Sullivan, was just six years old, and I would like to dedicate the first \npoem to her ... \n\nFor a Child of Aurora, with Butterflies\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhere does the butterfly go\nwhen lightning rails, when thunder howls,\nwhen hailstones scream while winter scowls\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\nWhere does the butterfly go?\n\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\nWhen the only relief\'s a banked fire\'s glow,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\nand hope is lost without a trace?\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nHere is a prayer-poem that I would like to dedicate to the survivors of the \nAurora shootings and the victims\' families and friends:\n\nI Pray Tonight\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI pray tonight\nthe starry light\nmight\nsurround you.\n\nI pray\neach day\nthat, come what may,\nno dark thing confound you.\n\nI pray ere the morrow\nan end to your sorrow.\nMay angels\' white chorales\nsing, and astound you.\n\n\nI would also like to quote a poem by one of my favorite contemporary poets that \nseems appropriate as we think about comforting and helping the survivors:\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby T. Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\nAurora Call to Love\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nOur hearts are broken today\nfor our children\'s small bodies lie broken;\nlet us gather them up, as we may,\nthat the truth of our Love may be spoken;\nthen, when we have put them away\nto nevermore dream, or be woken,\nlet us think of the living, and pray\nfor true Love, not some miserable token,\nto command us, for strength to obey.\n\nAurora Call to Action\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWe see their tiny coffins\nand our hearts break,\nso we ask the NRA\x97\nDid you make a mistake?\nAnd we vow to save the next child\nfor sweet love\'s sake,\nbut also to protect ourselves\nfrom enduring such heartache. \n\nThose of us who oppose the Holocaust have a saying: Never again! From this day \nforward I hope that we, as a nation, will say Never again! to such carnage \namong our children and teenagers because a rich, powerful gun lobby wants to flood the streets \nwith people carrying loaded, concealed weapons, taking us back to the days of \nthe Wild, Wild West. For anyone who thinks this is a good idea, I would remind \nthem that the West\'s greatest law officer, Wyatt Earp, didn\'t allow anyone to \nwalk around with guns in the towns he policed, except for himself and his \ndeputies, and that the famous battle at the OK Corral was fought over gun \ncontrol. \n\n\nI dedicate my poems to the victims \x97 may \nthey rest in peace \x97 and I urge all Americans to act\nnow, before the next massacre. If we don\'t, our loved \nones will remain continually at risk:\n\nEpitaph for a Child of Aurora\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died. \nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nThe lives, safety and happiness of our \nchildren depend on our ability to persuade the NRA and its political lackeys to \nstop exalting money and political gain above the life, liberty and happiness of \ninnocents. What is the cost of banning assault weapons, compared to the ultimate \nprice innocents pay when they are used by madmen playing Rambo in classrooms and \ntheaters? Ironically, just hours before the Sandy Hook massacre, in a weekly \ncolumn that I write for the Nashville City Paper, I pointed out that right-wing \npoliticians are not just demanding the right of citizens to bear loaded \nhandguns into restaurants that serve alcohol and bars \x97 a combustible mix. No, \npeople who call themselves conservative Christians in collusion with the NRA \nand its gun lobby are demanding the right to carry assault weapons everywhere \n... which logically means into universities, high schools, grade schools, \nkindergartens, pre-schools, Sunday schools and maternity wards. When I wrote \nthis, I was speaking ironically \x97 I thought \x97 but then a few hours later the NRA \nand its political minions made me seem like a prophet. \n\nShooting Gallery\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf we live by the rule of the gun\nwhat can a child do, \nbut run?\n\n\nI wrote the poem below for another child gunned down \nby a madman. While we cannot legislate sanity, we can be sane enough to \nlegislate away the right of serial killers to purchase assault weapons so \neasily. We can defend many small victims from such carnage, if we the people \nhave the wisdom and the will to defend them. \n\nChild of 9-11\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na poem for Christina-Taylor Green, who was born\non September 11, 2001 and died at the age of nine, \nshot to death ...\n\n\nChild of 9-11, beloved, \nI bring this lily, lay it down\nhere at your feet, and eiderdown,\nand all soft things, for your gentle spirit. \nI bring this psalm \x97 I hope you hear it.\n\nMuch love I bring \x97 I lay it down\nhere by your form, which is not you,\nbut what you left this shell-shocked world\nto help us learn what we must do\nto save another child like you.\n\nChild of 9-11, I know\nyou are not here, but watch, afar\nfrom distant stars, where angels rue\nthe brutal things some mortals do.\nI also watch; I also rue.\n\nAnd so I make this pledge and vow:\nthough I may weep, I will not rest\nnor will my pen fail heaven\'s test\ntill guns and wars and hate are banned\nfrom every shore, from every land.\n\nChild of 9-11, I grieve\nyour tender life, cut short ... bereaved,\nwhat can I do, but pledge my life\nto saving lives like yours? Belief\nin your sweet worth has led me here ...\n\nI give my all: my pen, this tear,\nthis lily and this eiderdown,\nand all soft things my heart can bear;\nI bear them to your final bier,\nand leave them with my promise, here.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings left 27 students and educators \ndead, and question our nation\'s sanity and resolve to put children\'s lives above \nmoney and politics. Why do we allow serial killers like Adam Lanza to \nhave such easy access to assault weapons and wreak destruction on innocent children \nand their teachers? Surely \nevery thinking American knows that assault weapons are being sold and \ndistributed so freely only to fill the coffers of gun dealers and the NRA, and for the political \ngain of those politicians who accept their bribes (euphemistically \ncalled campaign contributions). When will we call this evil collusion what it \nreally is: treason, infamy, and the murder of innocents? Adam Lanza may have been \ninsane, but what is the excuse of the NRA and its bribe-taking political \nlackeys?\n\nUS or Them? \nby Michael R. Burch\nThe NRA wants money in the till,\nthus Adam Lanza had a license to kill.\nOur government\x92s the serial killer\x92s shill\nand will be, unless WE express OUR will\nand vote to save our children from Boot Hill. \n\nThis haiku below makes me think of the students and teachers of Sandy Hook, who \nwere trapped in a war zone:\n\nWar\nstood at the end of the hall\nin the long shadows\n\x97original haiku by \nWatanabe Hakusen, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIt is up to us, as a nation, to choose between the rights of adults to carry \nassault weapons and loaded, concealed weapons without restriction, and the right \nof children not to be exposed to the war zones that other dubious right \ncreates in school hallways. Are we going to make it legal for anyone with a \ngrudge against life to carry out Rambo-like assaults in grade school classrooms \nand corridors? What if the next would-be Rambo wants to up the ante by shooting \nup a kindergarten or nursery school?\n\n\nPiercing the Shell\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf we strip away all the accouterments of war,\nperhaps we\'ll discover what the heart is for.\n\nIt seems to me that the NRA has declared a war \x97  an \nopen season \x97 on our children, by insisting that \nassault weapons must be available to every Tom, Dick and Dirty Harry. But what \nwill we, the people, say and do?\n\nWhence Now?\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nGrown darkly accustomed to grief,\nwill we ever turn over a new leaf?\n\nWho knows what wonderful things the twenty dead children and the seven \ndead educators might have accomplished, if they had lived? Now they are only \nmemories, and for most of the world memories diffuse with time. Let us try to \nkeep them alive in our minds and hearts, and prevent what happened to them from \nhappening to other innocents and their caregivers. \n\nSomething\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSomething inescapable is lost\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\nimmeasurable and void.\n\nSomething uncapturable is gone\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\nand remembrance.\n\nSomething unforgettable is past\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\n\nIt is hard to think of mothers not having the chance to say goodbye to their \nchildren, and just as hard to think of them having to say goodbye. Surely as a \nnation we must do everything possible to prevent either scenario, to the best of \nour ability. \n\n\nFrail Envelope of Flesh\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFrail envelope of flesh,\nlying cold on the surgeons table\nwith anguished eyes\nlike your mothers eyes\nand a heartbeat weak, unstable ...\n\nFrail crucible of dust,\nbrief flower come to this\nyour tiny hand\nin your mothers hand\nfor a last bewildered kiss ...\n\nBrief mayfly of a child,\nto live six artless years!\nNow your mothers lips\nseal up your lips\nfrom the Deluge of her tears ...\n\nHere is a touching poem by one of the all-time great poets, William Blake. It \ncalls us to remember the innocence and potential of even the youngest children. \nSurely it is up to us to protect them and make sure they wake to see each new \nmorning, until they realize their full potential.\n\n\nCradle Songby William Blake\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n \nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n \nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n \nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\nIf you read this far, I thank you very much for your time, and I ask you once \nagain to consider doing everything you can to help prevent similar things from \nhappening to other young students and their educators and caregivers. \n\nRelated pages: \n\nParkland Poems, Sandy Hook Poems, \n\nSanta Fe Poems,\nAurora Poetry,\nColumbine Poems,\nCourtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\nDarfur Poems,\nGaza Poems,\nHaiti Poems, \nHiroshima Poems, \nHolocaust Poems,\nNakba Poems,\n911 Poems,\nTrail of Tears\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
