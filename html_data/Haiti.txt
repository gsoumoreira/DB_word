Merrill\n\nYou, who read no calm reportings\nOf alien, distant, dire events,\nBut shriek and keen as loves go down\nBeyond all help, to violence;\nWhose temple\'s walls, stormstruck and split\nBy sizzling bolts collapse around,\nWhile mid the crash of chaos hope\nWhirls in a death-spin to the ground;\nYou, who alone in deep distress\nCry out for help where there is none,\nAll you whom I shall never know:\nI know a portion nonetheless \nOfcruel trials you undergo.\n\nKillers in many guises come: \nSudden as electric shock\nOr looming ghostly as a shark\nLeisurely finning toward its mark.\nI who breathless and sweating once\nWrestled a devil to the floor,\nAnd saw him rise again when he\nFinished what he began before,\nI who re-learned each childhood prayer\nForgotten,to the stars once more\nSend up apoor and hopeless plea\nFor spirit\'s peace beyond despair.\n\n\nTowers\nby \nLeslie Mellichamp\n\nProudly flash our towers in the sun,\nTemples earth has never felt before;\nIntricate, aloof--no taint of soil\nDesecrates a polished corridor.\n\nDoubtless we will build them to the end,\nForgetting or ignoring that their stem\nRests only upon earth.An earth that may\nBut shudder in its dream and swallow them.\n\n\nFor a Haitian Child, with Butterflies\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhere does the butterfly go\nwhen lightning rails and thunder howls\nand hailstones scream and winter scowls\nand storms compound the frost with snow?\nWhere does the butterfly go?\n\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\nand stars such vacuum fail to fill?\nWhere does she then her bloom bestow,\nand where does the butterfly go?\n\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\nand hope is lost without a trace?\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nSweet child of Haiti, \nlead, O, and I\'ll follow,\nfor surely, my Angel, you know . . . \n\nExile\nby Hart Crane\n\nMy hands have not touched pleasure since your hands,\nNo,nor my lips freed laughter since \'farewell\',\nAnd with the day, distance again expands\nVoiceless between us, as an uncoiled shell.\n\nYet love endures, though starving and alone.\nA dove\'s wings cling about my heart each night\nWith surging gentleness, and the blue stone\nSet in the tryst-ring has but worn more bright.\n\nLullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n        \n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n        \n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n        \n\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\n\nBread and Music by Conrad Aiken\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\n\nSong For The Last Act \n\nby Louise Bogan\n\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\n\n\nUphill \nby Christina Rossetti\n\nDoes the road wind up-hill all the way?\n Yes, to the very end.\nWill the day\'s journey take the whole long day?\n From morn to night, my friend.\n\nBut is there for the night a resting-place?\n A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\nMay not the darkness hide it from my face?\n You cannot miss that inn.\n\nShall I meet other wayfarers at night?\n Those who have gone before.\nThen must I knock, or call when just in sight?\n They will not keep you standing at that door.\n\nShall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?\n Of labour you shall find the sum.\nWill there be beds for me and all who seek?\n Yea, beds for all who come.\n\n\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\nSong \nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\n\nOn My First Son\nby Ben Jonson\n\n      Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\n    My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\n    Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\n    Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\n    O, could I lose all father now! For why\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\n    As what he loves may never like too much.\n    \n\nNeglect\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\nWhat good are your tears?\nThey will not spare the dying their anguish.\nWhat good is your concern\nto a child sick of living, waiting to perish?\n\nWhat good, the warm benevolence of tears\nwithout action?\nWhat help, the eloquence of prayers,\nor a pleasant benediction?\n\nBefore this day is gone,\nhow many more children will die\nwith bellies swollen, wasted limbs,\nand eyes too parched to cry?\n\nI fear for our souls\nas I hear the faint lament\nof their souls departing . . .\nmournful, and distant.\n\nHow pitiful our effort,\nyet how fatal its effect.\nIf they died, then surely we killed them,\nif only with neglect.\n\nRelated pages:\n\n\nSandy Hook Poems,\nColumbine Poems,\nDarfur \nPoems,\nGaza \nPoems,\n\nHaiti Poems, Hiroshima \nPoems, Holocaust Poems,\n\nNakba Poems,\n\n911 Poems,\nTrail \nof Tears\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
