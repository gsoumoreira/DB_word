Of course this is just one person\'s opinion, for whatever it\'s worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not going to glorify war, but will attempt to address war deaths truthfully \r\nthrough the voices of soldier-poets like Rupert Brooke, \r\nRobert Graves, Randall Jarrell, John McCrea,\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, Alan Seeger (the uncle of Pete Seeger) and\r\nSiegfried Sassoon. I will offer poems and songs that ask us to consider the \r\nreal cost of war, for the soldiers who die in combat and their families. We can honor the \r\nbravery, courage, sacrifice and patriotism of the fallen, even if we question \r\nwhether some of the wars were justifiable.\r\nMemorial Day Hymn for Fallen Soldiers\r\nby Michael R. Burch \r\nSound the awesome cannons.\r\nPin medals to each breast.\r\nAttention, honor guard!\r\nGive them a heros rest.\r\nRecite their names to the heavens\r\nTill the stars acknowledge their kin.\r\nThen let the land they defended\r\nGather them in again.\r\nNOTE: When I learned theres an American military organization, the DPAA \r\n(Defense/POW/MIA Accounting Agency) that is still finding and bringing home the \r\nbodies of soldiers who died serving their country in World War II, after \r\nblubbering like a baby, I managed to eke out this poem. Please feel free to \r\nshare my poem/hymn for noncommercial purposes, but please cite me as the author \r\nif you do. Thanks!\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R.

E. Housman\r\n\r\nHere dead lie we because we did not choose\r\nTo live and shame the land from which we sprung.\r\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\r\nBut young men think it is, and we were young.\r\n\r\nI have loved these four lines by Housman since the day I first read them.\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell\r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State,\r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.\r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,\r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.\r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell worked as a control tower \r\noperator during World War II, an experience which influenced and provided \r\nmaterial for his poetry.\r\n\r\nAthenian Epitaphs\r\n\r\n\r\nPasserby,\r\nTell the Spartans we lie\r\nLifeless at Thermopylae:\r\nDead at their word,\r\nObedient to their command.\r\nHave they heard?\r\nDo they understand?\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\r\n\r\nI believe many valiant American soldiers, sailors, airmen, airwomen and marines who died in wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq could ask the same question. Were the wars really necessary? Did they accomplish \r\ntheir goals? Have their countrymen heard? Do they understand?\r\n\r\nHere he lies in state tonight: great is his Monument!\r\nYet Ares cares not, neither does War relent.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Anacreon\r\n\r\nThey observed our fearful fetters, braved the overwhelming darkness.\r\nNow we extol their excellence: bravely, they died for us.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Mnasalcas\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nBut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Plato\r\n\r\nBlame not the gale, nor the inhospitable sea-gulf, nor friends tardiness,\r\nMariner! Just mans foolhardiness.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Leonidas of Tarentum\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gulls in their high, lonely circuits may tell.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Glaucus\r\n\r\nSome of the most powerful poems I have read are inscriptions found on the tombstones of \r\nancient Greeks. So I created a small collection of English epigrams modeled \r\nafter epitaphs gleaned from ancient Greek gravestones and called the collection \r\nAthenian Epitaphs. There are more Athenian Epitaphs later on this \r\npage. \r\n\r\nThe Soldier\r\nby Rupert Booke (1887-1915), who died during WWI\r\n\r\nIf I should die, think only this of me:\r\nThat theres some corner of a foreign field\r\nThat is for ever England. There shall be\r\nIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;\r\nA dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,\r\nGave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam;\r\nA body of Englands, breathing English air,\r\nWashed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.\r\n\r\nAnd think, this heart, all evil shed away,\r\nA pulse in the eternal mind, no less\r\nGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;\r\nHer sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;\r\nAnd laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,\r\nIn hearts at peace, under an English heaven.\r\n\r\nThis poem by Rupert Brooke has had two titles: The Soldier \r\nandNineteen-Fourteen: The Soldier. \r\n\r\nMemorial Rain: for Kenneth MacLeish\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nAmbassador Puser the ambassador\r\nReminds himself in French, felicitous tongue,\r\nWhat these (young men no longer) lie here for\r\nIn rows that once, and somewhere else, were young . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night in Brussels the wind had tugged at my door:\r\nI had heard the wind at my door and the trees strung\r\nTaut, and to me who had never been before\r\nIn that country it was a strange wind, blowing\r\nSteadily, stiffening the walls, the floor,\r\nThe roof of my room. I had not slept for knowing\r\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\r\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the winds flowing\r\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\r\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\r\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\r\nListening.\r\n\r\n. . . Reflects that these enjoy\r\nTheir countrys gratitude, that deep repose,\r\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\r\nThat rest, that sleep . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\r\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\r\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\r\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\r\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\r\nI felt him waiting.\r\n\r\n. . . Indicates the flag\r\nWhich (may he say) enisles1in \r\nFlanders plain\r\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\r\nHave made America . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ripe grain\r\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\r\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\r\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\r\nWaitinglistening . . .\r\n\r\n. . . Dedicates to them\r\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\r\nA grateful country . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the dry grass stem\r\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\r\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\r\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\r\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\r\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\r\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\r\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\r\n\r\nMemorial Rain was written by Archibald MacLeish as a memorial for his brother, \r\nKenneth MacLeish. \r\n\r\nThe Silent Slain\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nWe too, we too, descending once again\r\nThe hills of our own land, we too have heard\r\nFar offAh, que ce cor a longue haleine\r\nThe horn of Roland in the passages of Spain,\r\nthe first, the second blast, the failing third,\r\nAnd with the third turned back and climbed once more\r\nThe steep road southward, and heard faint the sound\r\nOf swords, of horses, the disastrous war,\r\nAnd crossed the dark defile at last, and found\r\nAt Roncevaux upon the darkening plain\r\nThe dead against the dead and on the silent ground\r\nThe silent slain\r\n\r\nThe story of Roland sounding his horn to warn his king, Charlemagne, of an \r\nambush is one of the most poignant in ancient literature. The Song of Roland \r\nwas one of my favorite stories as a young boy. \r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n\r\n\r\nDulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\nfrom Horace\'s Odes and means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\nto die for one\'s country. This is one of the first and best \r\ngraphic anti-war poems in the English language.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous Anglo-Saxon poem, circa 960-990 AD) \r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy people pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nThere are bloodthirsty curs on this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rainedhow I wept!\r\nthe boldest cur took me in his paws.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome. \r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat!\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? Watchdog!\r\nA wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer is an ancient Anglo-Saxon poem that reminds us of \r\nthe heavy toll war takes on women and children, as well as combatants. This is one of the oldest poems in the English language, and is quite \r\npossibly the first extant English poem by a female poet. It is also one of the \r\nfirst English poems to employ a refrain.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever fights monsters should see to it\r\nthat in the process he does not become a monster.\r\nIf you gaze for long into an abyss,\r\nthe abyss gazes also into you. \r\n Friedrich Nietzsche\r\n\r\nI believe the advice above should be considered by the leaders of the \r\nUnited States and its allies.\r\n\r\nWhich plunderers hand ransacked the pure gold statute of your dreams\r\nin this horrendous storm?\r\nNadia Anjuman, Afghani poet\r\n\r\nWar robs children and their mothers of their golden dreams. How many Vietnamese, \r\nAfghani and Iraqi mothers and their children were robbed of their dreams by \r\nAmerican wars?\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know The Truth\r\nby Marina Tsvetaeva\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI know the truthabandon lesser truths!\r\nThere\'s no need for anyone living to struggle!\r\nSee? Evening falls, night quickly descends!\r\nSo why the useless disputes, generals, poets, lovers?\r\n\r\nThe wind is calming now; the earth is bathed in dew;\r\nthe stars\' infernos will soon freeze in the heavens.\r\nAnd soon we\'ll sleep together, under the earth,\r\nwe who never gave each other a moment\'s rest above it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman lives are brief enough, so why shorten them by engaging in unnecessary \r\nwars? \r\n\r\n\r\nPostcard 1\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten August 30, 1944\r\ntranslated by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOut of Bulgaria, the great wild roar of the artillery thunders,\r\nresounds on the mountain ridges, rebounds, then ebbs into silence\r\nwhile here men, beasts, wagons and imagination all steadily increase;\r\nthe road whinnies and bucks, neighing; the maned sky gallops;\r\nand you are eternally with me, love, constant amid all the chaos,\r\nglowing within my conscience  incandescent, intense.\r\nSomewhere within me, dear, you abide forever \r\nstill, motionless, mute, like an angel stunned to silence by death\r\nor a beetle hiding in the heart of a rotting tree.\r\n\r\nPostcard 2\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten October 6, 1944 near Crvenka, Serbia\r\ntranslated by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA few miles away they\'re incinerating\r\nthe haystacks and the houses,\r\nwhile squatting here on the fringe of this pleasant meadow,\r\nthe shell-shocked peasants quietly smoke their pipes.\r\nNow, here, stepping into this still pond, the little shepherd girl\r\nsets the silver water a-ripple\r\nwhile, leaning over to drink, her flocculent sheep\r\nseem to swim like drifting clouds ...\r\n\r\nPostcard 3\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten October 24, 1944 near Moh\xe1cs, Hungary\r\ntranslated by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe oxen dribble bloody spittle;\r\nthe\r\nmen pass blood in their piss.\r\nOur stinking regiment halts, a horde of perspiring savages,\r\nadding our aroma to death\'s repulsive stench.\r\n\r\nPostcard 4\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nhis final poem, written October 31, 1944 near Szentkir\xe1lyszabadja, Hungary\r\ntranslated by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI toppled beside him  his body already taut,\r\ntight as a string just before it snaps,\r\nshot in the back of the head.\r\n"This is how youll end too; just lie quietly here,"\r\nI whispered to myself, patience blossoming from dread.\r\n"Der springt noch auf, the voice above me jeered;\r\nI could only dimly hear\r\nthrough the congealing blood slowly sealing my ear.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti is the greatest of the Holocaust poets, and one of \r\nthe very best anti-war poets, along with Wilfred Owen and singer-songwriters \r\nlike Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and John Lennon.\r\n\r\nIn Flanders Fields\r\nby Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae\r\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\r\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\r\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\r\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\r\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\r\n\r\nWe are the Dead.\r\nShort days ago\r\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\r\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\r\nIn Flanders fields.\r\n\r\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:\r\nTo you from failing hands we throw\r\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.\r\nIf ye break faith with us who die\r\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\r\nIn Flanders fields.\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats was probably the last of the great Romantics, and the first of the \r\ngreat Modernists. He wrote a good number of truly great poems, and remains an \r\nessential poet of the highest rank. An Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\nis a wonderful poem that illustrates how the people who die in war often have \r\nlittle to gain and everything to lose.Yeats wrote the poem for Robert \r\nGregory, the son of his patron Lady Gregory. Several of Yeats\' poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nDover Beach may be the first modern poem. When Arnold speaks of the Sea of \r\nFaith retreating, he seems to be setting the stage for Modernism, which to some \r\ndegree was the reaction of men who began to increasingly suspect that the \r\nwisdom contained in the Bible was hardly the revelation of an all-knowing God.\r\n\r\nNaming of Parts\r\nby Henry Reed\r\n\r\nVixi duellis nuper idoneus\r\nEt militavi non sine glori\r\n\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling swivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let me\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\r\n They call it easing the Spring.\r\n\r\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\r\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of balance,\r\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the almond-blossom\r\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards,\r\n For today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nHenry Reed is likely to be remembered by this one poem, but fortunately for him \r\n(and for us) it should make him immortal.\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen is a war poet without peer, and one of the first great modern \r\npoets. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est is probably the best anti-war poem in the \r\nEnglish language, perhaps in any language. If man ever grows wise enough as a \r\nspecies to abolish war, Wilfred Owen\'s voice, echoed in thousands of other poems \r\nand songs, will have been a major catalyst.\r\n\r\nThe Dug-Out\r\nby Siegfried Sassoon\r\n\r\nWhy do you lie with your legs ungainly huddled,\r\nAnd one arm bent across your sullen, cold,\r\nExhausted face? It hurts my heart to watch you,\r\nDeep-shadowed from the candle\'s guttering gold;\r\nAnd you wonder why I shake you by the shoulder;\r\nDrowsy, you mumble and sigh and turn your head ...\r\nYou are too young to fall asleep for ever;\r\nAnd when you sleep you remind me of the dead.\r\n\r\nSiegfried Sassoon is remembered today as a poet who wrote realistically about World War I, \r\nwith tremendous empathy and without artifice. Sassoon wrote the introduction to \r\nthe collected poems of Isaac Rosenberg, who did not survive World War I ...\r\nBreak of Day in the Trenches\r\nby Isaac Rosenberg\r\n\r\nThe darkness crumbles away.\r\nIt is the same old druid Time as ever,\r\nOnly a live thing leaps my hand,\r\nA queer sardonic rat,\r\nAs I pull the parapets poppy\r\nTo stick behind my ear.\r\nDroll rat, they would shoot you if they knew\r\nYour cosmopolitan sympathies.\r\nNow you have touched this English hand\r\nYou will do the same to a German\r\nSoon, no doubt, if it be your pleasure\r\nTo cross the sleeping green between.\r\nIt seems you inwardly grin as you pass\r\nStrong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes,\r\nLess chanced than you for life,\r\nBonds to the whims of murder,\r\nSprawled in the bowels of the earth,\r\nThe torn fields of France.\r\nWhat do you see in our eyes\r\nAt the shrieking iron and flame\r\nHurled through still heavens?\r\nWhat quaverwhat heart aghast?\r\nPoppies whose roots are in mans veins\r\nDrop, and are ever dropping;\r\nBut mine in my ear is safe\r\nJust a little white with the dust.\r\n\r\nIsaac Rosenberg helps us see war as a theater of the absurd: He\'s sticking a \r\npoppy behind his ear while sharing a hole with a rat whose cosmopolitan \r\nsympathies allow it to consort with both sides.\r\n\r\nUntitled\r\nby Charles Hamilton Sorley\r\n\r\nWhen you see millions of the mouthless dead\r\nAcross your dreams in pale battalions go,\r\nSay not soft things as other men have said,\r\nThat youll remember. For you need not so.\r\nGive them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know\r\nIt is not curses heaped on each gashed head?\r\nNor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.\r\nNor honour. It is easy to be dead.\r\nSay only this, They are dead. Then add thereto,\r\nYet many a better one has died before.\r\nThen, scanning all the oercrowded mass, should you\r\nPerceive one face that you loved heretofore,\r\nIt is a spook. None wears the face you knew.\r\nGreat death has made all his for evermore.\r\n\r\nCharles Hamilton Sorley was just 20 years old when he died \r\nat the Battle of Loos in 1915. The Scottish war poet left his most \r\nfamous poem untitled at his death. Robert Graves, a war poet himself, called Sorley \r\none of the \r\nthree poets of importance killed during the war, along with Isaac Rosenberg and \r\nWilfred Owen. Sorleys poems were \r\npublished posthumously as Marlborough and Other Poemsin 1916. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lost Pilot  \r\nby James Tate\r\n\r\nfor my father, 1922-1944\r\n\r\nYour face did not rot\r\nlike the othersthe co-pilot, \r\nfor example, I saw him\r\n\r\nyesterday. His face is corn-\r\nmush: his wife and daughter, \r\nthe poor ignorant people, stare\r\n\r\nas if he will compose soon.\r\nHe was more wronged than Job. \r\nBut your face did not rot\r\n\r\nlike the othersit grew dark,\r\nand hard like ebony;\r\nthe features progressed in their\r\n\r\ndistinction. If I could cajole\r\nyou to come back for an evening, \r\ndown from your compulsive\r\n\r\norbiting, I would touch you, \r\nread your face as Dallas, \r\nyour hoodlum gunner, now,\r\n\r\nwith the blistered eyes, reads \r\nhis braille editions. I would\r\ntouch your face as a disinterested\r\n\r\nscholar touches an original page. \r\nHowever frightening, I would \r\ndiscover you, and I would not\r\n\r\nturn you in; I would not make \r\nyou face your wife, or Dallas, \r\nor the co-pilot, Jim. You\r\n\r\ncould return to your crazy \r\norbiting, and I would not try \r\nto fully understand what\r\n\r\nit means to you. All I know \r\nis this: when I see you, \r\nas I have seen you at least\r\n\r\nonce every year of my life, \r\nspin across the wilds of the sky \r\nlike a tiny, African god,\r\n\r\nI feel dead. I feel as if I were \r\nthe residue of a strangers life, \r\nthat I should pursue you.\r\n\r\nMy head cocked toward the sky, \r\nI cannot get off the ground, \r\nand, you, passing over again,\r\n\r\nfast, perfect, and unwilling \r\nto tell me that you are doing \r\nwell, or that it was mistake\r\n\r\nthat placed you in that world,\r\nand me in this; or that misfortune \r\nplaced these worlds in us.\r\n\r\nI Have a Rendezvous with Death\r\nby Alan Seeger\r\n\r\nIhavea rendezvous with Death \r\nAt some disputed barricade, \r\nWhen Spring comes back with rustling shade \r\nAnd apple-blossoms fill the air \r\nI have a rendezvous with Death\r\nWhen Spring brings back blue days and fair. \r\n\r\nIt may be he shall take my hand \r\nAnd lead me into his dark land \r\nAnd close my eyes and quench my breath \r\nIt may be I shall pass him still.\r\nI have a rendezvous with Death \r\nOn some scarred slope of battered hill, \r\nWhen Spring comes round again this year \r\nAnd the first meadow-flowers appear. \r\n\r\nGod knows \'twere better to be deep\r\nPillowed in silk and scented down, \r\nWhere love throbs out in blissful sleep, \r\nPulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath, \r\nWhere hushed awakenings are dear ... \r\nBut I\'ve a rendezvous with Death\r\nAt midnight in some flaming town, \r\nWhen Spring trips north again this year, \r\nAnd I to my pledged word am true, \r\nI shall not fail that rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Soldier\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nLife contracts and death is expected,\r\nAs in a season of autumn.\r\nThe soldier falls.\r\n\r\nHe does not become a three-days\' personage,\r\nImposing his separation,\r\nCalling for pomp.\r\n\r\nDeath is absolute and without memorial,\r\nAs in a season of autumn,\r\nWhen the wind stops.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind stops and, over the heavens,\r\nThe clouds go, nevertheless,\r\nIn their direction.\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens is not generally considered to be among the war poets or \r\nanti-war poets, but in this poem he does capture something of the loss of a \r\nsoldier\'s life, and how the world continues on nonetheless. \r\n\r\n1915\r\nby Robert Graves\r\n\r\nIve watched the Seasons passing slow, so slow,\r\nIn the fields between La Bass\xe9e and Bethune;\r\nPrimroses and the first warm day of Spring,\r\nRed poppy floods of June,\r\nAugust, and yellowing Autumn, so\r\nTo Winter nights knee-deep in mud or snow,\r\nAnd youve been everything.\r\n\r\nDear, youve been everything that I most lack\r\nIn these soul-deadening trenchespictures, books,\r\nMusic, the quiet of an English wood,\r\nBeautiful comrade-looks,\r\nThe narrow, bouldered mountain-track,\r\nThe broad, full-bosomed ocean, green and black,\r\nAnd Peace, and all thats good.\r\n\r\nPrivilege \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThis poem is dedicated to Harvey Stanbrough, an ex-marine who was \r\nnominated for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize and has written passionately and \r\neloquently about the horror and absurdity of war in Lessons for a Barren \r\nPopulation. \r\nNo, I will never know\r\nwhat you saw or what you felt,\r\nthrust into the maw of Eternity,\r\nwatching the mortars nightly\r\ngreedily making their rounds,\r\nhearing the soft damp hiss\r\nof mens souls like helium escaping\r\ntheir collapsing torn bodies,\r\nor lying alone, feeling the great roar\r\nof your own heart.\r\nBut I know:\r\nthere is a bitter knowledge\r\nof death I have not achieved.\r\nThus in thankful ignorance,\r\nand especially for my son\r\nand for all who benefit so easily\r\nat so unthinkable a price,\r\nI thank you.\r\n\r\nJerusalem\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\r\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\r\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\r\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\r\n\r\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\r\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\r\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\r\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\r\n\r\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\r\nBring me my arrows of desire:\r\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\r\nBring me my chariot of fire.\r\n\r\nI will not cease from mental fight,\r\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\r\nTill we have built Jerusalem\r\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\r\n\r\nThe English prophet-poet William Blake proposes another form of warfare: a \r\nmental fight against the Satanic mills of what what Dwight D. Eisenhower would \r\nlater call the military-industrial complex.\r\n\r\nMore Athenian Epitaphs\r\n\r\nNow that I am dead sea-enclosed Cyzicus shrouds my bones.\r\nFaretheewell, O my adoptive land that nurtured me, that held me;\r\nI take rest at your breast.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Erycius\r\n\r\nBe ashamed, O mountains and seas: these were men of valorous breath.\r\nAssume, like pale chattels, an ashen silence at death.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Parmenio \r\n\r\nThese men earned a crown of imperishable glory,\r\nNor did the maelstrom of death obscure their story.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\r\n\r\nStranger, flee!\r\nBut may Fortune grant you all the prosperity\r\nshe denied me. \r\nMichael R. Burch, after Leonidas of Tarentum\r\n\r\nPoetry is with us from the start.\r\nLike loving,\r\nlike hunger, like the plague, like war.\r\nAt times my verses were embarrassingly foolish.\r\nBut I make no excuse.\r\nI believe that seeking beautiful words \r\nis better \r\nthan killing and murdering.\r\nIaroslav Seifert, Czech poet, winner of the Nobel prize in 1984\r\n\r\n  go my friend\r\nbestow your love\r\neven on your enemies\r\nif you touch their hearts\r\nwhat do you think will happen\r\nJalaluddin Rumi, Iranian poet, translated \r\nby Nader Khalili\r\n\r\nOther Memorial Day Poems and Songs\r\n\r\nMCMXIV by Philip Larkin (the title is 1914 in Roman \r\nnumerals: the year WWI started)\r\nBreak of Day in the Trenches by Isaac Rosenberg\r\nSuicide in the Trenches by Siegfried Sassoon\r\nFast Rode the Knight by Stephen Crane\r\nAfter the Persian by Louise Bogan\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution by Chidiock Tichborne\r\nDistant Light\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\nThe Unknown Dead by Elizabeth Robbins Berry \r\n\r\nOne Tin Soldier by Coven\r\nA Piece of Paper by Gladstone\r\nFour Dead in Ohio by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young\r\nFind the Cost of Freedom by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young\r\nFor What It\'s Worth by Buffalo Springfield\r\nThe Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down by Joan Baez\r\nBorn in the USA by Bruce Springsteen\r\nGoodnight Saigon by Billy Joel\r\nAllentown by Billy Joel\r\nBlowin\' in the Wind by Bob Dylan\r\nGive Peace a Chance and Happy Xmas (War is Over) by John Lennon\r\nPeace Train by Cat Stevens\r\nTurn!
