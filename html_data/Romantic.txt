On \nthis page I will attempt to trace the brilliant-but-elusive thread of \nRomanticism from the mists of Greek and Anglo-Saxon antiquity, through precursors of \nEnglish Romanticism like Edmund Spenser, Thomas Wyatt, John Donne and John \nMilton, on to the big six of William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats \nand \nPercy Bysshe Shelley. I will also include early American Romantics like Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Edgar Alan Poe, along with Ireland\'s Tom Moore, \nScotland\'s Robert Burns and France\'s Charles Baudelaire \nand Victor Hugo. Modern Romantics include Conrad Aiken, \nLouise Bogan, Hart \nCrane, e. e. cummings, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Dowson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Wilfred Owen, \nSylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Dylan \nThomas, William Butler Yeats and Oscar Wilde. Unknown or under-known poets who \nmerit consideration include two exceptional poets who died in their teens: \nThomas Chatterton and Digby Mackworth Dolben. I will also include contemporary \nRomantics like \nKevin N. Roberts and\nMary Rae. \n\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe first great lyric \npoet of antiquity, and perhaps the first Romantic poet we know by name today, was \nSappho of Lesbos ...\n\n\n\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\n\nSappho of Lesbos (c. 630 BC-570 BC) is perhaps the first great female poet still known to us \nby name today, \nand she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. \nShe is so revered for her erotic love poetry that we get our terms sapphic and lesbian from her name \nand island of residence. And as you can see from the two stellar epigrams \nbelow, she remains a timeless treasure:\n\nSappho, fragment 42\nloose translation by Michael R.

Burch\n\nA short transparent frock?\nIt\'s just my luck\nyour lips were made to mock!\n\nA Brief History of English Romantic Poetry, compiled by Michael R. Burch (some dates \nare approximations):\n\r\n5600 BC  Rising seas separate England from the European \r\nmainland; one consequence is that the natives\' language begins to evolve \r\nseparately from its continental peers ...\r\n1268 BC  This is Robert Graves\' date for the\r\nSong of Amergin, but dating such orally-transmitted works of the\r\nPrehistoric Period is a highly speculative \nendeavor!\n55 BC  Julius Caesar invades England beginning the \r\nAnglo-Roman Period \r\n(55 BC-410 AD). Latin is the language of rulers, clergy and scholars. Native poetry \nis oral. \r\n410 AD  Rome is sacked; the Roman legions no longer  \r\ndefend England and Germanic tribes invade, beginning the\r\nAnglo-Saxon or \r\nOld English Period (410-1066). \r\n658  \r\nCaedmon\'s Hymn, the \r\noldest authenticated English poem, marks the \r\nbeginning of English poetry (although it was \r\nAnglo-Saxon and thus still heavily Germanic). \r\n950  The Exeter Book contains the first  \r\nEnglish poems likely written by women,\r\nWulf and Eadwacer \r\nand\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament, and the first English rhyming poem. \r\n1066  William the Conqueror wins at Hastings; this Norman Conquest  \r\nbegins the Anglo-Norman or Middle English Period \r\n(1066-1340). French and Latin rule. \r\n1000 \r\n\r\nNow skruketh rose and lylie flour is one of the earliest and best \nEnglish love poems. English has gone underground but still survives.\r\n1200  \r\nHow Long the Night \r\n(Myrie it is while sumer\r\nylast) is one of the best Middle English \nrhyming poems. \r\n1260 \r\nRhyme rules with\r\n\r\nSumer is icumen in, \r\nFowles in the Frith, \r\nIch \r\nam of Irlaunde (I am of Ireland), \r\nNow Goeth Sun Under Wood, \r\nPity Mary.\r\n1340  Geoffrey Chaucer is the first major poet to write \r\nin English, beginning the Late Middle \r\nEnglish Period (1340-1503).\r\n1430  A haunting riddle-chant from this era is\r\n\r\nI Have a Yong Suster.\r\n\r\n1485  The Tudor Period (1457-1603) ends the Middle Ages. English rules over French, finally! William Dunbar\'s \nSweet Rose of Virtue.\n1500  The great early English ballads such as Sir \nPatrick Spens, Edward, The Unquiet Grave and Lord Randal. \n1503  \nThomas Wyatt and Henry Howard introduce \r\nthe sonnet, iambic pentameter and blank verse, beginning the\r\nEnglish Renaissance or Early Modern English Period \r\n(1503-1558). \r\n1558  The Elizabethan Period (1558-1603) \nfeatures major \r\nworks by Edmund Spenser, Walter Ralegh, Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare.\r\n1603  The \r\nJacobean/Caroline/Interregnum/Restoration Period (1603-1690) \r\nfeatures the King James Bible, Ben Jonson, John Donne, John Milton, Robert \nHerrick.\r\n1690  The Augustan Period (1690-1756) \nfeatures sophisticated work by Alexander Pope, John Dryden, Samuel Johnson, et \nal. (But it seems like a dry spell today.)\r\n1752 \nThomas Chatterton \nwas called the marvellous boy \r\nby William Wordsworth. Although he died at age seventeen, Chatterton has been called the first \nmodern Romantic poet.\r\n1757  The \r\nEnglish Romantic Period (1757-1837) stars William Blake, William Wordsworth, \nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert \nBurns. \n1800  American Romantics include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Alan Poe, Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, \nWalt Whitman, Emily Dickinson.\n1837  The Victorian Period (1837-1900) stars \r\nAlfred Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Gerard Manley Hopkins, \r\nJohn Clare, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. \r\n\r\n1848  The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (1848-1882) was founded by Dante Gabriel Rossetti; aligned poets \nwere \r\nChristina Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. \r\n\r\n1900  Leading voices of Modernism and \r\nPostmodernism (1901-Present) include Ernest Dowson, William Butler Yeats, \r\nThomas Hardy, A. E. Housman, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, \r\nD. H. \r\nLawrence, T. S. Eliot, Conrad Aiken, \r\nWilfred Owen, e. e. cummings, Louise Bogan, Hart Crane, \r\nLangston Hughes, W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, \r\nDylan Thomas, Sylvia Plath, Adele, Leonard Cohen, Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan, Eminem, \nWoody Guthrie, Michael Jackson, Carole King, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Willie \nNelson, Prince, Smokey Robinson, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen and \nHank Williams Sr. \n\r\n\n1969  Kevin N. Roberts, the founder and first editor of\nRomantics Quarterly, claimed to be the \nreincarnation of Swinburne and some of his fans believed he wrote that well ...\n\n\nRondel by \nKevin N. Roberts\n\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\nOur time has passed.\n\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\nLike all good things we know can never last,\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\nOur time has passed.\n\nSafe Harbor by \n Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Kevin N. Roberts\n\nThe sea at night seems\nan alembic of dreams\nthe moans of the gulls,\nthe foghorns bawlings.\n\nA century late\nto be melancholy,\nI watch the last shrimp boat as it steams\nto safe harbor again.\n\nIn the twilight she gleams\nwith a festive light,\ndone with her trawlings,\nready to sleep . . .\n\nDeep, deep, in delight\nglide the creatures of night,\nelusive and bright\nas the poets dreams.\n\nThe poem above was written in 2001 after a discussion \nabout Romanticism in the late 20th century. Mary Rae was the second editor of\nRomantics Quarterly and also provided \nthe exquisitely lovely covers of the issues she edited. \n\nSeason by \nMary Rae\n\nI\nYouth and love unite beneath the power \nof velvet skin and dark, half-sleeping eyes. \nSpring seems to last forever to the flower \nthat feels the rush of chlorophyll\'s green rise. \nTime is notcannot be of the essence \nwhen second hands are slow, standing still, \nwhile all around the sun is streaming gold. \nThe thought of end, of beauty\'s obsolescence, \nseems unreasonable and cannot hold \nas long as love is dressed in daffodil. \n\nII \nYouth never sees itself or has a reason \nto know that it has no infinity. \nIt turns, like spring, a sweet, unknowing season, \nnever doubting its divinity. \nBut as in fall trees look down on their leaves \nthat once had been too much a part to see, \npowerless to reconstitute the whole; \nso age sees fallen beauties and it grieves \nthe unclothing of the lonely soul \nthat, now in rags, goes begging tree to tree.\n\n\n\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \nproper and violently homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous today for \nhis disdain for respectability and dull and dulling conformity, as his witty \nepigrams prove. But the lovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that he was \nalso a great Romantic poet. \n\nRequiescat\nby Oscar Wilde\n\n\nTread lightly, she is near\nUnder the snow,\nSpeak gently, she can hear\nThe daisies grow.\n\nAll her bright golden hair\nTarnished with rust,\nShe that was young and fair\nFallen to dust.\n\nLily-like, white as snow,\nShe hardly knew\nShe was a woman, so\nSweetly she grew.\n\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\nLie on her breast,\nI vex my heart alone,\nShe is at rest.\n\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\nLyre or sonnet,\nAll my life\'s buried here,\nHeap earth upon it.\n\n\n\n\nBread and Music by Conrad Aiken\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To ) by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\n\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \nunrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne helped \nmake her almost as famous as he was in Ireland. The moving poem below is Yeats\' \nloose translation of a Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \nlife in her later years tending a fire. The second poem below, The Wild Swans \nat Coole is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \nlanguage.\n\n\n\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\nThe woodland paths are dry,\nUnder the October twilight the water\nMirrors a still sky;\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\nSince I first made my count;\nI saw, before I had well finished,\nAll suddenly mount\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\nAnd now my heart is sore.\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\nThe first time on this shore,\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\nThey paddle in the cold,\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water\nMysterious, beautiful;\nAmong what rushes will they build,\nBy what lakes edge or pool\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\nTo find they have flown away?\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. \n\nHow Do I Love Thee?\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\nI love with a passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death.\n\n\n\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is the best villanelle in the English \nlanguage, in my opinion, and one of the most powerful and haunting poems ever \nwritten in any language. \n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n\n\n\nSong for the Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\nEpitaph for a Romantic Woman\nby Louise Bogan\n\nShe has attained the permanence\nShe dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.\nUntended stalks blow over her\nEven and swift, like young men running.\n\nAlways in the heart she loved\nOthers had lived,she heard their laughter.\nShe lies where none has lain before,\nWhere certainly none will follow after.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a warm summer afternoon in 1867, Digby Mackworth Dolben drowned at  \r\nage nineteen. The poems he left behind were said by future English poet laureate Robert Bridges to \r\nequal anything that was ever written by any English poet at his age. \r\nAccording to Simon Edge, author of The Hopkins Conundrum, Gerard Manley Hopkins was so captivated by a brief meeting [with Dolben] that he spent the rest of his \r\nlife mourning him. In a letter to Bridges after \r\nDolbens death, Hopkins said there can very seldom have happened the loss of so \r\nmuch beauty (in body and mind and life) and of the promise of still more as \r\nthere has been in his case. Hopkins also asked Bridges whether Dolben\'s family \r\nhad considered publishing his poems. Fortunately, the independently wealthy \r\nBridges later published books of poems by both Dolben and Hopkins, or their \r\npoetry might have been lost to the world forever.\r\nIs Dolben merely a literary curiosity today because he attracted the attention \r\nof two famous poetswith possible homoerotic \r\nundertones on Hopkins\' partthen died so young \r\nand so tragically? Or does he merit consideration as a poet in his own right? \r\nAfterhis discovery ofthe prodigy\'s work thanks to Simon\'s novel, THT advisory \r\neditor Tom Merrillemailed Simonthat Dolben\'s precocity surprised mehow \r\nbeyond his years he was. I hope people know about him. He was a deeply sensitive \r\nperson, maybe comparable to Shelley. Another poet to whom Dolben may be \r\ncompared is Thomas Chatterton, the marvellous boy who died at age seventeen \r\nand yet was so highly esteemed by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats and Shelley. \r\n\r\nASong\r\nby Digby Dolben, age 16-19\n\nThe world is young today:\r\nForget the gods are old,\r\nForget the years of gold\r\nWhen all the months were May.\r\n\r\nA little flower of Love\r\nIs ours, without a root,\r\nWithout the end of fruit,\r\nYet  take the scent thereof.\r\n\r\nThere may be hope above,\r\nThere may be rest beneath;\r\nWe see them not, but Death\r\nIs palpable  and Love.\n\nWas Thomas Chatterton the greatest child prodigy in the history of poetry, or \r\nwas he a forger and fraud? That Chatterton was among the most remarkable of  \r\nchild prodigies is hard to dispute, because at age ten he was writing \r\npoems that were published, and by his early teens he had taught himself medieval \r\nEnglish and was producing poems by a fictitious poet, Thomas Rowley, in the language and style of Chaucer \r\nand his contemporaries. The young Chatterton taught \r\nhimself to write in the ye olde Englische style, and to use ocher \r\nand other chemicals to age the \r\ndiscovered manuscripts to make them look medieval. While his compositions were \r\nfar from perfect, in terms of complying with all the complicated rules of that \r\nlong-ago day, and were eventually exposed as modern work, some of the poems were \r\nso good they enchanted the great Romantic poets who saw Chatterton as one of \r\nthem. Was the child an evil genius, or were there, perhaps, perfectly good and \r\nunderstandable reasons for his deceptions?\r\nBefore we proceed, please allow me to make the point that if Chatterton\'s poems \r\nhave artistic merit, there really isn\'t a case to be made against him. If he \r\ntold the truth and really did find the poems, then he was an honest boy who was \r\nvery unfairly criminalized. On the other hand, if he wrote the poems himself, he \r\nwas not a forger, but an unusually original and gifted artist at a \nvery young age. In either case, where is the case against him? I don\'t think \nthere is one. But a valid question remains: how good were the poems he wrote, \nsince it seems rather obvious that he did write the poems? Great poets like \nWilliam Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy \nBysshe Shelley and John Keats praised the lad and claimed he was one of them. \nPresumably, great poets should know great poetry when they read it. So let\'s \ntake a look at a poem that I believe rivals Shakespeare\'s best songs in his \nplays ...\r\n\r\nSong from \xc6lla: Under the Willow Tree, or, Minstrel\'s Roundelay\r\nby Thomas Chatterton, age 17\r\n\r\nOSINGunto my roundelay, \r\nO drop the briny tear with me; \r\nDance no more at holy-day, \r\nLike a running river be: \r\nMy love is dead,\r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nBlack his cryne as the winter night, cryne = crown, hair; \r\nBlack his crown/hair/locks/etc.\r\nWhite his rode as the summer snow,  rode = complexion; \r\nWhite his skin/flesh/etc.\r\nRed his face as the morning light,\r\nCold he lies in the grave below: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nSweet his tongue as the throstle\'s note,\r\nQuick in dance as thought can be, \r\nDeft his tabor, cudgel stout; \r\nO he lies by the willow-tree! \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nHark! the raven flaps his wing \r\nIn the briar\'d dell below; \r\nHark! the death-owl loud doth sing \r\nTo the nightmares, as they go:\r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nSee! the white moon shines on high; \r\nWhiter is my true-love\'s shroud:\r\nWhiter than the morning sky, \r\nWhiter than the evening cloud: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nHere upon my true-love\'s grave \r\nShall the barren flowers be laid; \r\nNot one holy saint to save \r\nAll the coldness of a maid: \r\nMy love is dead,\r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nWith my hands I\'ll dent the briars  dent = fasten, \r\ngird, frame; With my hands I\'ll frame the briars\r\nRound his holy corse to gre: \r\n corse = corpse (?); gre = grow; Round his \r\nholy corpse to grow \r\nOuph and fairy, light your fires, ouph = elf; \r\nElf and Fairy\r\nHere my body still shall be: \r\nHere my body still shall go\r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nCome, with acorn-cup and thorn,\r\nDrain my heart\xe8s blood away; \r\nLife and all its good I scorn, \r\nDance by night, or feast by day: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\n\nThe following is a poem from the mists of time and the dawn of the English \nlanguage ...\n\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon poem, circa 990 AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\nWe are so different.\n\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\nHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\nThey\'ll rip apart if he approaches their pack.\nWe are so different.\n\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\nWhenever it rained and I wept, disconsolate,\nbig, battle-strong arms grabbed and embraced me.\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\nour song together.\n\nTranslator\'s Notes: This may be the first extant poem authored by a woman in the \nthen-fledgling English language. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called the \nfirst English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and mocking \nthe man who has been raping and impregnating her. The poem\'s closing metaphor of \na loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never harmonized \nremains one of the strongest in the English language, or any language.\n\r\nI will now continue on to the present day. There are over one billion speakers of English \nin the modern world and most, if not all, seem to be poets. So I\'ve had to narrow my scope to the very best \npoems by the very best poets. For instance, take this darkly romantic poem by an American master:\n\nAcquainted With The Night by Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\n\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\nI am the swift uplifting rush\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\nI am the soft starshine at night.\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\nI am not there; I did not die.\n\nThis consoling elegy had a \nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \n\nWhile you may quibble with my definition of Romantic, I don\'t think you\'ll quibble with the \npoems themselves. If you don\'t care for essays, please proceed directly to the poems. If you\'re interested in hearing a brief, \nsomewhat tongue-in-cheek history of \nRomanticism first, here goes . . .\n\nRomanticism Then and Now\n\nDefine your terms!  \n\nSo Sophocles, the wisest man in ancient Greece, persistently insisted,\nand so I immediately find myself at a sticky point in this essay, because\nRomanticism and Romantic are among the most nebulous of terms. Rather than using \n\tvarious excellent (but\nnot necessarily helpful) definitions, I will instead warp back in time to the very\nfirst poet and tap into that first\nbright vein of Romanticism which soon became the motherlode of all poetry . . .\n\nWe find our first cave-poet in a pickle of a predicament, because he\'s a pounded-upon,\nbeaten-down, intensely hairy, foul-smelling troglodyte almost totally\nbereft of language. What\'s worse, he\'s trying to attract a mate, and all\nthe other male troglodytes are far hairier and fouler-smelling than he!\nThey have every alpha-male advantage! What is our despised, wordless, nameless poet to do? The object of his affection,\nknown to him longingly as Grunt, studiously ignores him because her other suitors supply her with\ngreat hunks of raw mastodon haunch, while he has only a few albino\ntermites to proffer. His cause seems hopeless . . .\nUntil, one night, staring up miserably at the stars that seem to wink knowingly \noverhead, mocking his plight, he has a sudden revelation.  The stars glitter like crystals he has \nseen littering certain tracts of stony ground nearby. Risking life and stubby \nlimb, he dashes past a few catnapping sabertooths to scoop up as much of the \nglittery quartz as he can manage to carry and not be eaten alive. Hands full of \niridescent symbols of his adoring longing, he rushes back to the communal cave, \nfinds Grunt, and proceeds to dump out his treasure at her fulsomely hairy feet.\nTentatively, she picks up a crystal and licks it. Nope, it\'s not salt,\nalthough if it had been salt it would have been an impressive gift. She\ngrunts, fidgets, frowns, quickly loses interest, then starts looking for something\nmore edible,\nsettling on a juicy anteater carcass recently brought to her by a suitor she thinks\nof admiringly as Belch.\nOur ignominious poet, so nondescript Grunt hasn\'t even bothered to assign him\na sound-name, is now totally despondent. If he can\'t communicate\nhis idea to her, his cause is lost. There\'ll be no tiny male troglodyte to\nreplicate his genes (which means no poetry for us, today). Forlornly, he\nmoons up at the stars, then, overtaken by wonder and awe, begins suddenly to\nmouth new, strange, never-before-heard sounds: ah, ah!, stars! Excitedly, he points\nup at the night\'s brilliant panorama of stars, then to the crystals shining at Grunt\'s\nbeaver-pelt-feet. Stars! Stars!\nShe looks blankly at him for a moment, then suddenly she gets it. Shrimp\nbring Grunt stars? In humankind\'s first moment of tenderness not\nattributable to the procurement of foodstuffs, she has bequeathed upon him her\nsound-name for the most scrumptious of all the delicacies she knows.\nMore importantly, Shrimp and Grunt have made the great simultaneous leap to\nsounds, words, metaphor, artistic imagination, and the communication and transference of\nemotion. This delightful m\xe9lange, I call Romanticism, especially when the emotion conveyed is\nsomehow exaggerated in the process. Romanticism is, by my definition,\nprimarily amplification of emotion. Now that statement will probably make many \nintellectuals wince. Aren\'t we talking about, shudder, overstatement? Yes,\nwe are. As we proceed, I will illustrate that the best poets do indeed engage in extravagance, \nin hyperbole, in overstatement.\nIt is my contention\nthat the best poets do pretty much what Shrimp did so many millennia ago:\nthey impress the people they want to impressthen potential mates, now\nprimarily readersby amplifying emotion. We moderns have become so \naccustomed to words that we sometimes\nforget the ah! in stars, the tinkle in\nlaughter, the hiss of danger in sinister. But the best poets don\'t forget these things, nor do they take them for\ngranted. Instead, the best poets use every weapon in the poetic arsenal of\nincendiary devices to conjure emotion. Poems are crafted of words just as buildings are \ncrafted of stone. It is a Romantic impulse that causes a Christopher Wren to imagine\nSt. Paul\'s Cathedral rather than a stone hovel; it is a similar Romantic impulse \nthat causes our friend Shrimp to imagine he can give Grunt the ah! in stars.\nBut now let me move beyond my clumsy attempts to apply a stethoscope to the \nRomantic (im)pulse, and get on to the really good (nay, the wondrous) stuff, the \npoems . . . \n\nThe Snow Man by Wallace Stevens \n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow; \nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter \nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves, \nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place \nFor the listener, who listens in the\nsnow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\nPiano by D. H. Lawrence \n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings. In\nspite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide. So now it is vain\nfor the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nThe Garden by Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof\na sort of emotional anemia. \nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth. In her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\n\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\n\nThe Death of a Toad by Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep \nmonotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard \ndaylight steer.\n\n\nThe Light of Other Days by Tom Moore \n\n\nOft, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\nFond Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me:\nThe smiles, the tears\nOf boyhood\'s years,\nThe words of love then spoken;\nThe eyes that shone,\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\nThus, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\nSad Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me.\n\nWhen I remember all\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\nI\'ve seen around me fall\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\nI feel like one\nWho treads alone\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\nWhose lights are fled,\nWhose garlands dead,\nAnd all but he departed!\nThus, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\nSad Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me.\n\n\nThe Unreturning by Wilfred Owen\n\n\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\n\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\n\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\n\nin Just- by e. e. cummings\n\nin Just-\nspring when the world is mud-\nluscious the little\nlame baloonman\n\nwhistles far and wee\n\nand eddieandbill come\nrunning from marbles and\npiracies and it\'s\nspring\n\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\n\nthe queer\nold baloonman whistles\nfar and wee\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\n\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\nit\'s\nspring\nand\n\n the\n\ngoat-footed\n\nbaloonMan whistles\nfar\nand\nwee\n\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\n\nI leant upon a coppice gate\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\n The weakening eye of day.\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\n Like strings of broken lyres,\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\n Had sought their household fires. \nThe land\'s sharp\nfeatures seemed to be\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\n The wind his death-lament.\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\nAnd every spirit upon earth\n Seemed fervourless as I. \nAt once a voice arose among\n The bleak twigs overhead\nIn a full-hearted evensong\n Of joy illimited;\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\n In blast-beruffled plume,\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\n Upon the growing gloom. \nSo little cause for carolings\n Of such ecstatic sound\nWas written on terrestrial things\n Afar or nigh around,\nThat I could think there trembled through\n His happy good-night air\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\n And I was unaware.\n\n\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae by\nErnest Dowson\n\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good\nCynaraHorace\n\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nLuke Havergal by Edward Arlington Robinson\n\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nIn eastern skies.\n\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\nTo tell you this.\n\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\nCradle Song by William Blake\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n\nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n\nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\n\nSong by John Donne\n\nGo and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,\nTell me where all past years are,\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\nAnd find\nWhat wind\nServes to advance an honest mind.\n\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\nThings invisible to see,\nRide ten thousand days and nights\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\nAnd swear\nNo where\nLives a woman true and fair.\n\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\nYet do not; I would not go,\nThough at next door we might meet.\nThough she were true when you met her,\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\nYet she\nWill be\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\n\nLullaby by W. H. Auden\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider by Walt Whitman\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\n\nFull Fathom Five \nby William Shakespeare\n\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n Of his bones are coral made;\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n Nothing of him that doth fade\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\n Ding-dong.\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\n\nThe Windhover \nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\n\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, \nin his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and \nstriding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the \nhurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\nStirred for a bird,  the achieve of, the mastery of the \nthing!\n\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, \nhere\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a \nbillion\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\n\nNo wonder of it: sheer plod makes plough down sillion\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion.\n\n\nSong by Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\nOzymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nI met a traveller from an antique land\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\nIn A Station Of The Metro by Ezra Pound\n\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\n\n\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving by George Gordon, Lord \nByron\n\n\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\n So late into the night,\nThough the heart be still as loving,\n And the moon be still as bright.\n\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\n And the soul outwears the breast,\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\n And love itself have rest.\n\nThough the night was made for loving,\n And the day returns too soon,\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\n By the light of the moon.\n\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold by William Wordsworth\n\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\n A rainbow in the sky:\nSo was it when my life began;\nSo is it now I am a man;\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\n Or let me die!\nThe Child is father of the Man;\nI could wish my days to be\nBound each to each by natural piety.\n\nThe Sick Rose by William Blake\n\nO Rose, thou art sick.\nThe invisible worm\nThat flies in the night\nIn the howling storm\nHas found out thy bed\nOf crimson joy,\nAnd his dark secret love\nDoes thy life destroy.\n\nUpon Julia\'s Clothes by Robert Herrick\n\nWhenasinsilksmyJuliagoes,\nThen,then,methinks,howsweetlyflows\nTheliquefactionofherclothes.\n\nNext,whenIcastmineeyesandsee\nThatbravevibrationeachwayfree,\nOh,howthatglitteringtakethme!\n\nA Red, Red Rose by Robert Burns\n\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\n\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\n\nSonnet 147 by William Shakespeare\n\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\n For I have sworn thee fair, and thought\nthee bright,\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\n\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be by John Keats\n\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\nNever have relish in the faery power\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\n\nThe Fountain Of Blood by Charles Baudelaire (translated by\nRachel Hadas)\n\nA fountain\'s pulsing sobslike this my blood\nMeasures its flowing, so it sometimes seems.\nI hear a gentle murmur as it streams;\nWhere the wound lies I\'ve never understood.\n\nLike water meadows, boulevards are flooded.\nCobblestones, crisscrossed by scarlet rills,\nAre islands;

I do not think I would.\n\n\nTo Celia by Ben Jonson\n\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\nDoth ask a drink divine:\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\nI would not change for thine.\n\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\nNot so much honouring thee,\nAs giving it a hope, that there\nIt could not withered be.\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\nNot of itself, but thee.\n\nWhen I Was One-and-Twenty by A.

Housman\n\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\nI heard a wise man say,\nGive crowns and pounds and guineas\nBut not your heart away;\nGive pearls away and rubies\nBut keep your fancy free.\nBut I was one-and-twenty,\nNo use to talk to me.\n\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\nI heard him say again,\nThe heart out of the bosom\nWas never given in vain;\n\'Tis paid with sighs a plenty\nAnd sold for endless rue.\nAnd I am two-and-twenty\nAnd oh, \'tis true, \'tis true.\n\nTo Daffodils by Robert Herrick\n\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\n You haste away so soon.\nAs yet the early-rising sun\n Hath not attained his noon.\n Stay, stay,\n Until the hasting day\n Has run\n But to the even-song;\nAnd, having prayed together, we\n Will go with you along.\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\n We have as short a spring;\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\n As you, or any thing.\n We die.\n As your hours do, and dry\n Away\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\n Ne\'er to be found again.\n\nGo, Lovely Rose by Edmund Waller \n\nGo, lovely Rose,\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\n That now she knows,\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\n\n Tell her that\'s young,\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\n That hadst thou sprung\nIn deserts where no men abide,\nThou must have uncommended died.\n\n Small is the worth\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\n Bid her come forth,\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\n\n Then die, that she\nThe common fate of all things rare\n May read in thee;\nHow small a part of time they share,\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\n\nAfton Water by Robert Burns\n\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\nFlow gently, I\'ll sing thee a song in thy praise;\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\nThou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro\' the glen,\nYe wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,\nThou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,\nI charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.\nHow lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills,\nFar mark\'d with the courses of clear winding rills;\nThere daily I wander as noon rises high,\nMy flocks and my Mary\'s sweet cot in my eye.\nHow pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,\nWhere wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;\nThere oft, as mild Ev\'ning sweeps over the lea,\nThe sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.\nThy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,\nAnd winds by the cot where my Mary resides,\nHow wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,\nAs gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave.\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\nFlow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\n\nHigh Flight by John Gillespie Magee\n\nOh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth\nAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings.\nSunward I\'ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirth\nOf sun-split clouds and done a hundred things\nYou have not dreamed ofwheeled and soared and swung\nHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov\'ring there\nI\'ve chased the shouting wind along and flung\nMy eager craft through footless halls of air.\nUp, up the long, delirious burning blue\nI\'ve topped the windswept heights with easy grace\nWhere never lark or even eagle flew,\nAnd while with silent lifting mind I\'ve trod\nThe high, untrespassed sanctity of space\nPut out my hand and touched the face of God.\n\nTo Helen by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nHelen, thy beauty is to me\nLike those Nicean barks of yore,\nThat gently, o\'er a perfumed sea,\nThe weary, wayworn wanderer bore\nTo his own native shore.\n\nOn desperate seas long wont to roam,\nThy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,\nThy Naiad airs have brought me home\nTo the glory that was Greece\nAnd the grandeur that was Rome.\n\nLo! in yon brilliant window-niche\nHow statue-like I see thee stand,\nThe agate lamp within thy hand!\nAh, Psyche, from the regions which\nAre Holy Land!\n\nMore Romantic Poems\n\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song (Anonymous Ballad, circa 1620)\nThe Bustle In A House by Emily Dickinson\nThe Dark-Eyed Gentleman by Thomas Hardy\nDirective by Robert Frost\nUlysses by Lord Alfred Tennyson\nMariana by Lord Alfred Tennyson \nOne Art by Elizabeth Bishop\nCirque d\'Hiver by Elizabeth Bishop\nThe Fish by Elizabeth Bishop\nThe Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls by e. e.\ncummings\nMethought I Saw by John Milton\nThe Send-Off by Wilfred Owen\nDulce Et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen\nAnthem For Doomed Youth by\nWilfred Owen\nRoman Fountain by Louise Bogan\nOn the Eve of His Execution \nby Chidiock Tichborne\nNo Second Troy by William Butler Yeats\n\nThe Balloon Of The Mind by William Butler Yeats\n\nNaming of Parts by Henry Reed\n\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer by Walt\nWhitman\nThe Listeners by Walter De La Mare\nExile by Hart Crane\nDying Speech Of An Old Philosopher by Walter Savage Landor\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death by\nWilliam Butler Yeats\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\nDover Beach by Matthew Arnold\nThe Broken Tower by Hart Crane\nForgetfulness by Hart Crane\nInterior by Hart Crane\nCargoes by \nJohn Masefield \n\nAplolgia Pro Vita Sua by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\nThe Garden Of Love by William Blake\nJerusalem by William Blake\nLondon by William Blake\nThe Tyger by William Blake\nIt Is A Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free by William\nWordsworth\nThe World Is Too Much With Us by William Wordsworth\nComposed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802 by\nWilliam Wordsworth\nThe Fitful Alternations Of The Rain by Percy Bysshe\nShelley\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressed by Edna St. Vincent Millay\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed by Edna St. Vincent Millay\nBeginning My Studies by Walt Whitman\nOn My First Son by Ben Jonson\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\nCold-Blooded Creatures by Elinor Morton Wylie\nThe Mill by Edward Arlington Robinson\nCredo by Edward Arlington Robinson\nHere Dead Lie We Because We Did Not Choose by A.
