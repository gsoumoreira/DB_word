Burch\r\n\r\nFairest Diana, princess of dreams, \r\nborn to be loved and yet distant and lone, \r\nwhy did you linger\x97so solemn, so lovely\x97\r\nan orchid ablaze in a crevice of stone? \r\n\r\nWas not your heart meant for tenderest passions?\r\nSurely your lipsfor \r\nwild kisses, not vows!\r\nWhy then did you languish, though lustrous, becoming \r\na pearl of enchantment cast before sows? \r\n\r\nFairest Diana, as fragile as lilac, \r\nas willful as rainfall, as true as the rose; \r\nhow did a stanza of silver-bright verse \r\ncome to be bound in a book of dull prose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill There Be Starlight\r\nfor Princess Diana\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWill there be starlight\r\ntonight\r\nwhile she gathers\r\ndamask\r\nand lilac\r\nand sweet-scented heathers?\r\n\r\nAnd will she find flowers,\r\nor will she find thorns\r\nguarding the petals\r\nof roses unborn?\r\n\r\nWill there be starlight\r\ntonight\r\nwhile she gathers\r\nseashells\r\nand mussels\r\nand albatross feathers?\r\n\r\nAnd will she find treasure\r\nor will she find pain\r\nat the end of this rainbow\r\nof moonlight on rain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTurn Again To Life\r\nby Mary Lee Hall\r\nread by Lady Sarah McCorquodale, eldest sister of Princess Diana, at her funeral\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I should die and leave you here awhile,\r\nBe not like others, sore undone, who keep\r\nLong vigils by the silent dust, and weep.\r\nFor my sake\x97turn again to life and smile, \r\nNerving thy heart and trembling hand to do\r\nSomething to comfort other hearts than thine.\r\nComplete those dear unfinished tasks of mine\r\nAnd I, perchance, may therein comfort you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHymn To Diana\r\nby\r\nBen Jonson\r\n\r\nQueen and huntress, chaste and fair,\r\nNow the sun is laid to sleep,\r\nSeated in thy silver chair,\r\nState in wonted manner keep:\r\nHesperus entreats thy light,\r\nGoddess excellently bright.\r\n\r\nEarth, let not thy envious shade\r\nDare itself to interpose;\r\nCynthia\'s shining orb was made\r\nHeaven to clear when day did close:\r\nBless us then with wish\xe8d sight,\r\nGoddess excellently bright.\r\n\r\nLay thy bow of pearl apart,\r\nAnd thy crystal-shining quiver;\r\nGive unto the flying hart\r\nSpace to breathe, how short soever;\r\nThou that mak\'st a day of night,\r\nGoddess excellently bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue \r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that death is merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMythology\r\nby Andrew Motion\r\n\r\nEarth\x92s axle creaks; the year jolts on; the trees\r\nbegin to slip their brittle leaves, their flakes of rust;\r\nand darkness takes the edge off daylight, not\r\nbecause it wants to\x97never that. Because it must.\r\n\r\nAnd you? Your life was not your own to keep\r\nor lose. Beside the river, swerving underground,\r\nthe future tracked you, snapping at your heels:\r\nDiana, breathless, hunted by your own quick hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 September 1997\r\nby Ted Hughes\r\n\r\nMankind is many rivers\r\nThat only want to run.\r\nHoly Tragedy and Loss\r\nMake the many One.\r\nMankind is a Holy, crowned\r\nMother and her Son.\r\nFor worship, for mourning:\r\nGod is here, is gone.\r\nLove is broken on the Cross.\r\nThe Flower on the Gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\x92s Rose\r\nby Bernie Taupin and Sir Elton John\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\'s rose\r\nMay you ever grow in our hearts\r\nYou were the grace that placed itself\r\nWhere lives were torn apart\r\n\r\nYou called out to our country\r\nAnd you whispered to those in pain\r\nNow you belong to heaven\r\nAnd the stars spell out your name\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\r\nLike a candle in the wind\r\nNever fading with the sunset\r\nWhen the rain set in\r\n\r\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\r\nAlong England\'s greenest hills\r\nYour candle\'s burned out long before\r\nYour legend ever will\r\n\r\nLoveliness we\'ve lost\r\nThese empty days without your smile\r\nThis torch we\'ll always carry\r\nFor our nation\'s golden child\r\n\r\nAnd even though we try\r\nThe truth brings us to tears\r\nAll our words cannot express\r\nThe joy you brought us through the years\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\r\nLike a candle in the wind\r\nNever fading with the sunset\r\nWhen the rain set in\r\n\r\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\r\nAlong England\'s greenest hills\r\nYour candle\'s burned our long before\r\nYour legend ever will\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\'s rose\r\nMay you ever grow in our hearts\r\nYou were the grace that placed itself\r\nWhere lives were torn apart\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\'s rose\r\nFrom a country lost without your soul\r\nWho\'ll miss the wings of your compassion\r\nMore than you\'ll ever know\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\r\nLike a candle in the wind\r\nNever fading with the sunset\r\nWhen the rain set in\r\n\r\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\r\nAlong England\'s greenest hills\r\nYour candle\'s burned out long before\r\nYour legend ever will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe Was Very Strange, and Beautiful\r\nfor Princess Diana\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nShe was very strange, and beautiful,\r\nlike a violet mist enshrouding hills\r\nbefore night falls\r\nwhen the hoot owl calls\r\nand the cricket trills\r\nand the envapored moon hangs low and full.\r\n\r\nShe was very strange, in a pleasant way,\r\nas the hummingbird\r\nflies madly still,\r\nso I drank my fill\r\nof her every word.\r\nWhat she knew of love, she demurred to say.\r\n\r\nShe was meant to leave, as the wind must blow,\r\nas the sun must set,\r\nas the rain must fall.\r\nThough she gave her all,\r\nwe had nothing left . . .\r\nyet we smiled, bereft, in her receding glow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peripheries of Love\r\nfor Princess Diana\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThrough waning afternoons we glide\r\nthe watery peripheries of love.\r\nA silence, a quietude falls.\r\n\r\nAbove usthe sagging pavilions of clouds.\r\nBelow usrough pebbles slowly worn smooth\r\ngrate in the gentle turbulence\r\nof yesterdays forgotten rains. \r\n\r\nLater, the moon like a virgin\r\nlifts her stricken white face\r\nand the waters rise\r\ntoward some unfathomable shore.\r\n\r\nWe sway gently in the wake\r\nof what stirs beneath us,\r\nyet leaves us unmoved ...\r\ncuriously motionless,\r\n\r\nas though twilight might blur\r\nthe effects of proximity and distance,\r\nas though love might be near\r\n\r\nas near\r\nas a single cupped tear of resilient dew \r\nor a long-awaited face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aery Faery Princess\r\nfor Princess Diana\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThere once was a princess lighter than fluff \r\nmade of such gossamer stuff\x97\r\nthe down of a thistle, butterflies\x92 wings, \r\nthe faintest high note the hummingbird sings, \r\nmoonbeams on garlands, stands of bright hair ... \r\nI think she\x92s just you when you\x92re floating on air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Pray Tonight\r\nfor Princess Diana\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI pray tonight\r\nthe starry light\r\nmight\r\nsurround you.\r\n\r\nI pray\r\nby day\r\nthat, come what may,\r\nno dark thing confound you.\r\n\r\nI pray ere tomorrow\r\nan end to your sorrow.\r\nMay angels\' white chorales\r\nsing, and astound you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincess Diana\'s Funeral Service\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the funeral procession moved to the Sacrarium, the Choir sang the Sentences:\r\n\r\nI am the Resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, \r\nthough he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me \r\nshall never die.\r\n(St John 11: 25-26)\r\n\r\nI know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon \r\nthe earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh \r\nshall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and \r\nnot another.\r\n(Job 19: 25-27)\r\n\r\nWe brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. \r\nThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\r\n(1 Timothy 6: 7; Job 1: 21)\r\n\r\nThou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears unto \r\nour prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and most \r\nmerciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last \r\nhour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee. Amen.\r\n(Book of Common Prayer)\r\n\r\nI heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, From henceforth blessed are \r\nthe dead which die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit; for they rest from \r\ntheir labours.\r\n(Revelations 14: 13)\r\n\r\nThe congregation then sang the hymn:\r\n\r\nI vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,\r\nentire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:\r\nthe love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,\r\nthat lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;\r\nthe love that never falters, the love that pays the price,\r\nthe love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd there\'s another country, I\'ve heard of long ago,\r\nmost dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;\r\nwe may not count her armies, we may not see her King;\r\nher fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;\r\nand soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,\r\nand her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.\r\n\r\nThe first reading was by the Princess\'s eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale:\r\n\r\nIf I should die and leave you here awhile,\r\nBe not like others, sore undone, who keep\r\nLong vigils by the silent dust, and weep.\r\nFor my sake\x97turn again to life and smile,\r\nNerving thy heart and trembling hand to do\r\nSomething to comfort other hearts than thine.\r\nComplete those dear unfinished tasks of mine\r\nAnd I, perchance, may therein comfort you.\r\n\r\nAfter the reading, the BBC Singers, together with the soprano Lynne Dawson, sang \r\nextracts from Verdi\'s Requiem:\r\n\r\nLibera me, Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa\r\ntremenda quando coeli movendi sunt, et terra:\r\ndum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem.\r\nTremens factus sum ego et timeo, dum\r\ndiscussio venerit, atque ventura ira. Dies illa,\r\ndies irae, calamitatis et miseriae, dies magna et\r\namara valde. Requiem aeternam dona eis\r\nDomine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeliver me, O Lord, from eternal death in that\r\ndread day when the heavens and the earth shall\r\nbe shaken, and you will come to judge the\r\nworld by fire. I tremble in awe of the judgement\r\nand the coming wrath. Day of wrath, day of\r\ncalamity and woe, great and exceeding bitter\r\nday. Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord, and\r\nlet perpetual light shine upon them.\r\n\r\nAll then stood to sing the hymn:\r\n\r\nThe King of love my Shepherd is,\r\nwhose goodness faileth never;\r\nI nothing lack if I am his\r\nand he is mine for ever.\r\nWhere streams of living water flow\r\nmy ransomed soul he leadeth,\r\nand where the verdant pastures grow\r\nwith food celestial feedeth.\r\nPerverse and foolish oft I strayed,\r\nbut yet in love he sought me,\r\nand on his shoulder gently laid,\r\nand home rejoicing brought me.\r\nIn death\'s dark vale I fear no ill\r\nwith thee, dear Lord, beside me;\r\nthy rod and staff my comfort still,\r\nthy cross before to guide me.\r\nThou spread\'st a table in my sight;\r\nthy unction grace bestoweth;\r\nand O what transports of delight\r\nfrom thy pure chalice floweth!\r\nAnd so through all the length of days\r\nthy goodness faileth never:\r\ngood Shepherd, may I sing thy praise\r\nwithin thy house for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP, read from 1 \r\nCorinthians 13:\r\n\r\nThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am \r\nbecome as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of \r\nprophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all \r\nfaith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.\r\nAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to \r\nbe burned,\r\nand have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long, and is \r\nkind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not \r\nbehave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no \r\nevil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in truth; beareth all things, \r\nbelieveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether \r\nthere be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish \r\naway. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is \r\nperfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\r\nWhen I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a \r\nchild: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see \r\nthrough a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then \r\nshall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, love, these \r\nthree; but the greatest of these is love.\r\n\r\nFollowing the reading, Elton John sang a special arrangement of his song Candle \r\nIn The Wind:\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\'s rose;\r\nmay you ever grow in our hearts.\r\nYou were the grace that placed yourself\r\nwhere lives were torn apart.\r\n\r\nYou called out to our country,\r\nand you whispered to those in pain.\r\nNow you belong to heaven,\r\nand the stars spell out your name.\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\r\nlike a candle in the wind:\r\nnever fading with the sunset\r\nwhen the rain set in.\r\n\r\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here,\r\nalong England\'s greenest hills;\r\nyour candle\'s burned out long before\r\nyour legend ever will.\r\n\r\nLoveliness we\'ve lost;\r\nthese empty days without your smile.\r\nThis torch we\'ll always carry\r\nfor our nation\'s golden child.\r\n\r\nAnd even though we try,\r\nthe truth brings us to tears;\r\nall our words cannot express\r\nthe joy you brought us through the years.\r\n\r\nGoodbye England\'s rose,\r\nfrom a country lost without your soul,\r\nwho\'ll miss the wings of your compassion\r\nmore than you\'ll ever know.\r\n\r\nThen followed The Tribute by the Princess\'s brother, The Earl Spencer:\r\n\r\nI stand before you today the representative of a family in grief, in a country \r\nin mourning before a world in shock. We are all united not only in our desire to \r\npay our respects to Diana but rather in our need to do so. For such was her \r\nextraordinary appeal that the tens of millions of people taking part in this \r\nservice all over the world via television and radio who never actually met her, \r\nfeel that they too lost someone close to them in the early hours of Sunday \r\nmorning. It is a more remarkable tribute to Diana than I can ever hope to offer \r\nher today.\r\n\r\nDiana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty. All over \r\nthe world she was a symbol of selfless humanity. All over the world, a \r\nstandard-bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a very British girl who \r\ntranscended nationality. Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and \r\nwho proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to \r\ngenerate her particular brand of magic.\r\n\r\nToday is our chance to say thank you for the way you brightened our lives, even \r\nthough God granted you but half a life. We will all feel cheated always that you \r\nwere taken from us so young and yet we must learn to be grateful that you came \r\nalong at all. Only now that you are gone do we truly appreciate what we are now \r\nwithout, and we want you to know that life without you is very, very difficult. \r\nWe have all despaired at your loss over the past week and only the strength of \r\nthe message you gave us through your years of giving has afforded us the \r\nstrength to move forward.\r\n\r\nThere is a temptation to rush to canonise your memory; there is no need to do \r\nso. You stand tall enough as a human being of unique qualities not to need to be \r\nseen as a saint. Indeed, to sanctify your memory would be to miss out on the \r\nvery core of your being, your wonderfully mischievous sense of humour with a \r\nlaugh that bent you double. Your joy for life transmitted wherever you took your \r\nsmile and the sparkle in those unforgettable eyes. Your boundless energy which \r\nyou could barely contain.\r\n\r\nBut your greatest gift was your intuition, and it was a gift you used wisely. \r\nThis is what underpinned all your other wonderful attributes and if we look to \r\nanalyse what it was about you that had such a wide appeal we find it in your \r\ninstinctive feel for what was really important in all our lives. Without your \r\nGod-given sensitivity we would be immersed in greater ignorance at the anguish \r\nof AIDS and HIV sufferers, the plight of the homeless, the isolation of lepers, \r\nthe random destruction of landmines. Diana explained to me once that it was her \r\ninnermost feelings of suffering that made it possible for her to connect with \r\nher constituency of the rejected. And here we come to another truth about her. \r\nFor all the status, the glamour, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very \r\ninsecure person at heart, almost childlike in her desire to do good for others \r\nso she could release herself from deep feelings of unworthiness of which her \r\neating disorders were merely a symptom. The world sensed this part of her \r\ncharacter and cherished her for her vulnerability whilst admiring her for her \r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Diana was on July 1, her birthday, in London, when typically \r\nshe was not taking time to celebrate her special day with friends but was guest \r\nof honour at a special charity fund-raising evening. She sparkled of course, but \r\nI would rather cherish the days I spent with her in March when she came to visit \r\nme and my children in our home in South Africa. I am proud of the fact that \r\napart from when she was on display meeting President Mandela we managed to \r\ncontrive to stop the ever-present paparazzi from getting a single picture of her\x97that meant a lot to her.\r\n\r\nThese were days I will always treasure. It was as if we had been transported \r\nback to our childhood when we spent such an enormous amount of time together\x97the two youngest in the family. Fundamentally she had not changed at all from \r\nthe big sister who mothered me as a baby, fought with me at school and endured \r\nthose long train journeys between our parents\' homes with me at weekends. It is \r\na tribute to her levelheadedness and strength that despite the most bizarre-like \r\nlife imaginable after her childhood, she remained intact, true to herself.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that she was looking for a new direction in her life at this \r\ntime. She talked endlessly of getting away from England, mainly because of the \r\ntreatment that she received at the hands of the newspapers. I don\'t think she \r\never understood why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, \r\nwhy there appeared to be a permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. It \r\nis baffling.\r\n\r\nMy own and only explanation is that genuine goodness is threatening to those at \r\nthe opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember that of all \r\nthe ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this\x97a girl given the name \r\nof the ancient goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the \r\nmodern age.\r\n\r\nShe would want us today to pledge ourselves to protecting her beloved boys \r\nWilliam and Harry from a similar fate and I do this here, Diana, on your behalf. \r\nWe will not allow them to suffer the anguish that used regularly to drive you to \r\ntearful despair.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond that, on behalf of your mother and sisters, I pledge that we, your \r\nblood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative way in which you \r\nwere steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply \r\nimmersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned.\r\n\r\nWe fully respect the heritage into which they have both been born and will \r\nalways respect and encourage them in their royal role but we, like you, \r\nrecognise the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as \r\npossible to arm them spiritually and emotionally for the years ahead. I know you \r\nwould have expected nothing less from us.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Harry, we all care desperately for you today. We are all chewed up \r\nwith the sadness at the loss of a woman who was not even our mother. How great \r\nyour suffering is, we cannot even imagine.\r\n\r\nI would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at \r\nthis dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when \r\nshe had joy in her private life. Above all we give thanks for the life of a \r\nwoman I am so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the \r\nextraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, \r\nwill never be extinguished from our minds.\r\n\r\nThe congregation then sang a hymn by St Francis of Assisi:\r\n\r\nMake me a channel of your peace:\r\nwhere there is hatred let me bring your love,\r\nwhere there is injury, your pardon, Lord,\r\nand where there\'s doubt, true faith in you:\r\n\r\nO Master grant that I may never seek\r\nso much to be consoled as to console;\r\nto be understood as to understand,\r\nto be loved, as to love with all my soul!\r\n\r\nMake me a channel of your peace:\r\nwhere there\'s despair in life let me bring hope,\r\nwhere there is darkness, only light,\r\nand where there\'s sadness, ever joy:\r\n\r\nMake me a channel of your peace:\r\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\r\nin giving of ourselves that we receive,\r\nand in dying that we\'re born to eternal life.\r\n\r\nMake me a channel of your peace:\r\nwhere there is hatred let me bring your love,\r\nwhere there is injury, your pardon, Lord,\r\nand where there\'s doubt, true faith in you.\r\n\r\nPrayers were then led by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend and \r\nRight Honourable Dr George Carey, beginning with the following prayer for Diana, \r\nPrincess of Wales:\r\n\r\nWe give thanks to God for Diana, Princess of Wales; for her sense of joy and for \r\nthe way she gave so much to so many people.\r\n\r\nLord, we thank you for Diana, whose life touched us all and for all those \r\nmemories of her that we treasure. We give thanks for those qualities and \r\nstrengths that endeared her to us; for her vulnerability; for her radiant and \r\nvibrant personality; for her ability to communicate warmth and compassion; for \r\nher ringing laugh; and above all for her readiness to identify with those less \r\nfortunate in our nation and the world.\r\n\r\nLord of the loving: hear our prayer.\r\n\r\nWe pray for those most closely affected by her death: for Prince William and \r\nPrince Harry who mourn the passing of their dearly loved mother; for her family, \r\nespecially for her mother, her brother and her sisters.\r\n\r\nLord, we thank you for the precious gift of family life, for all human \r\nrelationships and for the strength we draw from one another. Have compassion on \r\nthose for whom this parting brings particular pain and the deepest sense of \r\nloss. Casting their cares on you, may they know the gentleness of your presence \r\nand the consolation of your love.\r\n\r\nLord of the bereaved: hear our prayer.\r\n\r\nThere then followed prayers for the Princess\'s family; for the Royal family, for \r\nall in mourning and for the Princess\'s life and work:\r\nThe Princess will be especially missed by the many charities with which she \r\nidentifed herself. We recall those precious images: the affectionate cuddle of \r\nchildren in hospital; that touch of the young man dying of AIDS; her compassion \r\nfor those maimed through the evil of land mines\x97and many more.\r\n\r\nLord, we pray for all who are weak, poor and powerless in this country and \r\nthroughout the world; the sick, among them Trevor Rees-Jones [the injured \r\nbodyguard]; the maimed and all whose lives are damaged. We thank you for the way \r\nthat Diana became a beacon of hope and a source of strength for so many. We \r\ncommend to you all those charities that she supported. Strengthen the resolve of \r\nthose who work for them to continue the good work begun with her.\r\n\r\nLord of the suffering: hear our prayer.\r\n\r\nThe prayers concluded with the offering of a prayer for the congregation. The \r\nchoristers then sang An Air From County Derry:\r\n\r\nI would be true, for there are those that trust me.\r\nI would be pure, for there are those that care.\r\nI would be strong, for there is much to suffer.\r\nI would be brave, for there is much to dare.\r\nI would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless.\r\nI would be giving, and forget the gift,\r\nI would be humble, for I know my weakness,\r\nI would look up, laugh, love and live.\r\n\r\nThe congregation then sang the great Welsh hymn Cwm Rhondda:\r\n\r\nGuide me, O thou great Redeemer,\r\npilgrim through this barren land;\r\nI am weak, but thou art mighty;\r\nhold me with thy powerful hand:\r\nbread of heaven,\r\nfeed me now and evermore.\r\n\r\nOpen now the crystal fountain\r\nwhence the healing stream doth flow;\r\nlet the fiery cloudy pillar\r\nlead me all my journey through:\r\nstrong deliverer,\r\nbe thou still my strength and shield.\r\n\r\nWhen I tread the verge of Jordan,\r\nbid my anxious fears subside;\r\ndeath of death, and hell\'s destruction,\r\nland me safe on Canaan\'s side:\r\nsongs and praises\r\nI will ever give to thee.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
