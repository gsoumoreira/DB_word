This page will fill you \r\nin.\r\nThe best nonsense verse is appropriate for children of all ages. And ironically, \r\nthe best nonsense verse often makes perfect sense! The best nonsense \r\nwriters include Ogden Nash, Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Eugene Field, Lord \r\nByron, William Shakespeare, Rudyard Kipling, Hilaire Belloc, Oscar Wilde, \r\nDorothy Parker, Mother Goose, and \r\nthe greatest of all humorists, Anonymous. The more popular \r\nforms of humorous poetry include puns, doggerel, limericks, clerihews, double \r\ndactyls, spoonerisms and McWhirtles. The wider genre is typically called light \r\nverse, light poetry and/or humorous verse. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey Chaucer used the term rym doggerel in his 1387 Tale of Sir Thopas. \r\nJohn Skelton continued the doggerel tradition in his Magnyfycence (1519) and Speke Parrot \r\n(1521).\r\nHis brand became known as skeltonics. Edmund Spenser kept the nonsensical \r\nball rolling with Mother Hubbard\'s Tale in 1590. Shakespeare \r\nemployed fools and poor Tom the Bedlamite in his plays. To Market, To \r\nMarket was published in 1598, If Wishes Were Horses in 1628 \r\nand Jack Sprat in 1639. Some of the older Mother \r\nGoose nursery rhymes date to around 1650. Tom Thumb\'s Song Book, the \r\nfirst collection of British nursery rhymes, was published in 1744 and included \r\npoems like Baa Baa Black Sheep, Patty Cake and London Bridge. Edward Lear published absurdist limericks and art in The Book of \r\nNonsense in 1846. Lewis Carroll followed with Alice\'s Adventures in \r\nWonderland in 1865, Through the Looking Glass in 1872, and The \r\nHunting of the Snark in 1876. Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss was \r\npublished in 1960, and Where the Wild Things Are in 1963. The rest, as they say, is humorous history! \r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of nonsense verse in modern times include poems by Shel \r\nSilverstein, Spike Milligan, T. S. Eliot (especially the poems that became the \r\nmusical Cats), A. E. Housman, John Lennon, Mervyn Peake, Christopher Isherwood, Wendy Cope, \r\nEric Idle, Jack Prelutsky, Christian Morgenstern, Carolyn Wells, Ivor \r\nCutler and Laura E. Richards. Examples in popular music include Yellow Submarine and \r\nI Am the Walrus by the Beatles, The Purple People Eater by Sheb \r\nWooley, \r\nMonster Mash by Bobby Boris Pickett, and the musical \r\nparodies of Weird Al Yankovic. Examples in stand-up comedy include the very naughty adult nursery rhymes of \r\nAndrew Dice Clay. Now here, without further ado, are \r\nsome of the best nonsense poems of all time ... \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this page reflects one person\'s opinion, for whatever \r\nthat\'s worth ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cow \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe cow is of the bovine ilk; \r\nOne end is moo, the other, milk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan nonsense verse be used to explain Einstein\'s theory of relativity? \r\n\r\nThere was a young lady named Bright\r\nwho traveled much faster than light.\r\nShe set out one day\r\nin a relative way,\r\nand came back the previous night.\r\n\r\nI recently learned that the limerick above was originally penned in a slightly \r\ndifferent version by Arthur Henry Reginald Buller; his limerick appeared in Punch (Dec. 19, 1923).\r\n\r\nI find it intriguing that one of the best revelations of the weirdness and \r\nzaniness of \r\nrelativity can be found in a limerick. The limerick above inspired me to pennot onebut two rejoinders:\r\n\r\nAsstronomical I\r\n\r\nEinstein, the frizzy-haired,\r\nsaid E equals MC squared.\r\nThus  all mass decreases\r\nas activity ceases?\r\nNot my mass, my ass declared!\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAsstronomical II\r\n\r\n\r\nRelativity, the theorists creed,\r\nsays mass increases with speed.\r\nMy (m)ass grows when I sit it.\r\nMr. Einstein, get with it;\r\nequate its deflation, I plead!\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters of nonsense verse can attempt things far more difficult than explaining \r\nthe theory of relativity. For instance, they can tackle the Mt. Everest of \r\npoetry and try to rhyme with the words orange and silver ...\r\n\r\nEating an orange\r\nWhile making love\r\nMakes for bizarre enj-\r\nOyment thereof. \r\n\x97Tom Lehrer\r\n\r\nLehrer has also proposed far hinge, fore hinge, larynges and pharynges \r\nas rhymes for orange. He should at least get an E for Effort! \r\n\r\nTo find a rhyme for \x93silver,\x94\r\nOr any \x93rhymeless\x94 rhyme\r\nRequires only will, ver-\r\nBosity and time. \r\n\x97Stephen Sondheim\r\n\r\nMt. Everest is looking more and more attractive!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, getting back to more traditional nonsense verse ....\r\n\r\nThe Ostrich \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe ostrich roams the great Sahara. \r\nIts mouth is wide, its neck is narra. \r\nIt has such long and lofty legs, \r\nI\'m glad it sits to lay its eggs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an Old Man with a beard, \r\nWho said, It is just as I feared!\r\nTwo Owls and a Hen,\r\nFour Larks and a Wren,\r\nHave all built their nests in my beard!\r\n\x97Edward Lear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey diddle, diddle,\r\nThe cat and the fiddle. \r\nThe cow jumped over the moon. \r\nThe little dog laughed to see such sport, \r\nAnd the dish ran away with the spoon. \r\n\x97Mother Goose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Termite   by Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nSome primal termite knocked on wood \r\nAnd tasted it, and found it good! \r\nAnd that is why your Cousin May \r\nFell through the parlor floor today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady of Niger\r\nwho smiled as she rode on a tiger;\r\nThey returned from the ride\r\nwith the lady inside,\r\nand the smile on the face of the tiger.\r\n\x97attributed to Edward Lear and William Cosmo Monkhouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Turtle   by Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks \r\nWhich practically conceal its sex. \r\nI think it clever of the turtle \r\nIn such a fix to be so fertile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA wonderful bird is the pelican;\r\nHis beak can hold more than his belican.\r\nHe can hold in his beak\r\nEnough food for a week,\r\nThough Im damned if I know how the helican!\r\n\x97Dixon Lanier Merritt (often incorrectly \r\nascribed to Ogden Nash)\r\n\r\nThe limerick above reminds me of something Dorothy Parker once said about Oscar \r\nWilde: that when she read an especially good epigram, \r\nshe always assumed Wilde was the author. Ogden Nash holds a similar place of \r\ndistinction in the pantheon of limerick writers. One thing Nash did wonderfully \r\nwell was ignore the rules that often result in \r\nstiffly corseted formal poems. Nash\'s poems tend to be funny, irreverent, \r\nwhimsical and loosey-goosy. (Nash is to limericks as e. e. cummings is to \r\nsonnets.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wasp \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe wasp and all his numerous family \r\nI look upon as a major calamity. \r\nHe throws open his nest with prodigality, \r\nBut I distrust his waspitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHickory dickory dock,\r\nthe mouse ran up the clock;\r\nthe clock struck one\r\nand down he run;\r\nhickory dickory dock. \r\n\x97Mother Goose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crocodile\r\nby Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\nHow doth the little crocodile\r\nImprove his shining tail,\r\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\r\nOn every golden scale!\r\n\r\nHow cheerfully he seems to grin!\r\nHow neatly spread his claws,\r\nAnd welcomes little fishes in\r\nWith gently smiling jaws!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDot Spotted\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThere once was a leopardess, Dot,\r\nwho indignantly answered: I\x92ll not!\r\nThe gents are impressed\r\nwith the way that Im dressed.\r\nI wouldnt change even one spot.\r\n\r\nIf you like the nonsensical poem above, you\'re welcome to share it, but please \r\ncredit Michael R. Burch as the author. \r\n\r\nThe origin of the name limerick for this poetic form is still being debated. \r\nThe term was first officially documented in England in 1898, in the New \r\nEnglish Dictionary, but the form itself is much older. The name is \r\ngenerally considered to be a reference to the city or county of Limerick, \r\nIreland, and may derive from a parlor game that included a refrain such as Will \r\n[or won\'t] you come (up) to Limerick? The earliest known use of the name \r\nlimerick for a short, humorous lyric is an 1880 reference in a New Brunswick \r\nnewspaper to a tune apparently well-known at the time, Won\x92t you come to \r\nLimerick?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Was a Little Girl\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nThere was a little girl\r\nWho had a little curl\r\nRight in the middle of her forehead.\r\nWhen she was good\r\nShe was very good indeed,\r\nBut when she was bad she was horrid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest published American limerick appeared in 1902 in the Princeton Tiger:\r\n\r\nThere once was a man from Nantucket\r\nWho kept all his cash in a bucket.\r\nBut his daughter, named Nan,\r\nRan away with a man\r\nAnd as for the bucket, Nantucket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus \r\nby Hilaire Belloc\r\n\r\nI shoot the Hippopotamus\r\n  With bullets made of platinum,\r\nBecause if I use leaden ones\r\n  His hide is sure to flatten \'em.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vulture\r\nby Hilaire Belloc\r\n\r\nThe Vulture eats between his meals\r\nAnd that\'s the reason why\r\nHe very, very rarely feels\r\nAs well as you and I.\r\nHis eye is dull, his head is bald,\r\nHis neck is growing thinner.\r\nOh! what a lesson for us all\r\nTo only eat at dinner!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Octopus\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nTell me, O Octopus, I begs\r\nIs those things arms, or is they legs?\r\nI marvel at thee, Octopus;\r\nIf I were thou, I\'d call me Us.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Reflections on Parsley\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nParsley\r\nIs gharsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People Upstairs\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe people upstairs all practise ballet\r\nTheir living room is a bowling alley\r\nTheir bedroom is full of conducted tours.\r\nTheir radio is louder than yours,\r\nThey celebrate week-ends all the week.\r\nWhen they take a shower, your ceilings leak.\r\nThey try to get their parties to mix\r\nBy supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,\r\nAnd when their fun at last abates,\r\nThey go to the bathroom on roller skates.\r\nI might love the people upstairs more\r\nIf only they lived on another floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guppy \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nWhales have calves, \r\nCats have kittens, \r\nBears have cubs, \r\nBats have bittens, \r\nSwans have cygnets, \r\nSeals have puppies, \r\nBut guppies just have little guppies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat\r\nby Edward Lear\r\nI\r\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea\r\n In a beautiful pea green boat,\r\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money,\r\n Wrapped up in a five pound note.\r\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\r\n And sang to a small guitar,\r\n\'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,\r\n What a beautiful Pussy you are,\r\n You are,\r\n You are!\r\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are!\'\r\n\r\nII\r\nPussy said to the Owl, \'You elegant fowl!\r\n How charmingly sweet you sing!\r\nO let us be married! too long we have tarried:\r\n But what shall we do for a ring?\'\r\nThey sailed away, for a year and a day,\r\n To the land where the Bong-tree grows\r\nAnd there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood\r\n With a ring at the end of his nose,\r\n His nose,\r\n His nose,\r\nWith a ring at the end of his nose.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\'Dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling\r\n Your ring?\' Said the Piggy, \'I will.\'\r\nSo they took it away, and were married next day\r\n By the Turkey who lives on the hill.\r\nThey dined on mince, and slices of quince,\r\n Which they ate with a runcible spoon;\r\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\r\n They danced by the light of the moon,\r\n The moon,\r\n The moon,\r\nThey danced by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod\r\nby Eugene Field\r\n\r\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod one night\r\nSailed off in a wooden shoe\x97\r\nSailed on a river of crystal light,\r\nInto a sea of dew.\r\nWhere are you going, and what do you wish?\r\nThe old moon asked the three.\r\nWe have come to fish for the herring fish\r\nThat live in this beautiful sea;\r\nNets of silver and gold have we!\r\nSaid Wynken,\r\nBlynken,\r\nAnd Nod.\r\nThe old moon laughed and sang a song,\r\nAs they rocked in the wooden shoe,\r\nAnd the wind that sped them all night long\r\nRuffled the waves of dew.\r\nThe little stars were the herring fish\r\nThat lived in that beautiful sea\x97\r\nNow cast your nets wherever you wish\x97\r\nNever afeard are we;\r\nSo cried the stars to the fishermen three:\r\nWynken,\r\nBlynken,\r\nAnd Nod.\r\nAll night long their nets they threw\r\nTo the stars in the twinkling foam\x97\r\nThen down from the skies came the wooden shoe,\r\nBringing the fishermen home;\r\n\'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed\r\nAs if it could not be,\r\nAnd some folks thought \'t was a dream they \'d dreamed\r\nOf sailing that beautiful sea\x97\r\nBut I shall name you the fishermen three:\r\nWynken,\r\nBlynken,\r\nAnd Nod.\r\nWynken and Blynken are two little eyes,\r\nAnd Nod is a little head,\r\nAnd the wooden shoe that sailed the skies\r\nIs a wee one\'s trundle-bed.\r\nSo shut your eyes while mother sings\r\nOf wonderful sights that be,\r\nAnd you shall see the beautiful things\r\nAs you rock in the misty sea,\r\nWhere the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:\r\nWynken,\r\nBlynken,\r\nAnd Nod.\r\n\r\n\r\nJabberwocky\r\nby Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\n(fromThrough the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There)\r\n\r\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\r\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\r\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\r\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\r\n\r\nBeware the Jabberwock, my son!\r\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\r\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\r\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\r\n\r\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\r\nLong time the manxome foe he sought \x97\r\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\r\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\r\n\r\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\r\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\r\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\r\nAnd burbled as it came!\r\n\r\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through\r\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\r\nHe left it dead, and with its head\r\nHe went galumphing back.\r\n\r\nAnd, has thou slain the Jabberwock?\r\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\r\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\'\r\nHe chortled in his joy.\r\n\r\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\r\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\r\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\r\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and The Carpenter\r\nby\r\nLewis Carroll\r\n\r\n(fromThrough the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There)\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining on the sea,\r\nShining with all his might:\r\nHe did his very best to make\r\nThe billows smooth and bright\x97\r\nAnd this was odd, because it was\r\nThe middle of the night.\r\n\r\nThe moon was shining sulkily,\r\nBecause she thought the sun\r\nHad got no business to be there\r\nAfter the day was done\x97\r\nIt\'s very rude of him, she said,\r\nTo come and spoil the fun!\r\n\r\nThe sea was wet as wet could be,\r\nThe sands were dry as dry.\r\nYou could not see a cloud, because\r\nNo cloud was in the sky:\r\nNo birds were flying overhead\x97\r\nThere were no birds to fly.\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\r\nWere walking close at hand;\r\nThey wept like anything to see\r\nSuch quantities of sand:\r\nIf this were only cleared away,\r\nThey said, it would be grand!\r\n\r\nIf seven maids with seven mops\r\nSwept it for half a year.\r\nDo you suppose, the Walrus said,\r\nThat they could get it clear?\r\nI doubt it, said the Carpenter,\r\nAnd shed a bitter tear.\r\n\r\nO Oysters, come and walk with us!\r\nThe Walrus did beseech.\r\nA pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\r\nAlong the briny beach:\r\nWe cannot do with more than four,\r\nTo give a hand to each.\r\n\r\nThe eldest Oyster looked at him,\r\nBut never a word he said:\r\nThe eldest Oyster winked his eye,\r\nAnd shook his heavy head\x97\r\nMeaning to say he did not choose\r\nTo leave the oyster-bed.\r\n\r\nBut four young Oysters hurried up,\r\nAll eager for the treat:\r\nTheir coats were brushed, their faces washed,\r\nTheir shoes were clean and neat\x97\r\nAnd this was odd, because, you know,\r\nThey hadn\'t any feet.\r\n\r\nFour other Oysters followed them,\r\nAnd yet another four;\r\nAnd thick and fast they came at last,\r\nAnd more, and more, and more\x97\r\nAll hopping through the frothy waves,\r\nAnd scrambling to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\r\nWalked on a mile or so,\r\nAnd then they rested on a rock\r\nConveniently low:\r\nAnd all the little Oysters stood\r\nAnd waited in a row.\r\n\r\nThe time has come, the Walrus said,\r\nTo talk of many things:\r\nOf shoes\x97and ships\x97and sealing-wax\x97\r\nOf cabbages\x97and kings\x97\r\nAnd why the sea is boiling hot\x97\r\nAnd whether pigs have wings.\r\n\r\nBut wait a bit, the Oysters cried,\r\nBefore we have our chat;\r\nFor some of us are out of breath,\r\nAnd all of us are fat!\r\nNo hurry! said the Carpenter.\r\nThey thanked him much for that.\r\n\r\nA loaf of bread, the Walrus said,\r\nIs what we chiefly need:\r\nPepper and vinegar besides\r\nAre very good indeed\x97\r\nNow if you\'re ready, Oysters dear,\r\nWe can begin to feed.\r\n\r\nBut not on us! the Oysters cried,\r\nTurning a little blue.\r\nAfter such kindness, that would be\r\nA dismal thing to do!\r\nThe night is fine, the Walrus said.\r\nDo you admire the view?\r\n\r\nIt was so kind of you to come!\r\nAnd you are very nice!\r\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\r\nCut us another slice:\r\nI wish you were not quite so deaf\x97\r\nI\'ve had to ask you twice!\r\n\r\nIt seems a shame, the Walrus said,\r\nTo play them such a trick,\r\nAfter we\'ve brought them out so far,\r\nAnd made them trot so quick!\r\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\r\nThe butter\'s spread too thick!\r\n\r\nI weep for you, the Walrus said:\r\nI deeply sympathize.\r\nWith sobs and tears he sorted out\r\nThose of the largest size,\r\nHolding his pocket-handkerchief\r\nBefore his streaming eyes.\r\n\r\nO Oysters, said the Carpenter,\r\nYou\'ve had a pleasant run!\r\nShall we be trotting home again?\'\r\nBut answer came there none\x97\r\nAnd this was scarcely odd, because\r\nThey\'d eaten every one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou Are Old, Father William\r\nby Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\nYou are old, Father William, the young man said,\r\nAnd your hair has become very white;\r\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\x97\r\nDo you think, at your age age, it is right?\r\n\r\nIn my youth, Father William replied to his son,\r\nI feared it might injure the brain;\r\nBut, now that I\'m perfectly sure I have none,\r\nWhy, I do it again and again.\r\n\r\nYou are old, said the youth,  as I mentioned before,\r\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\r\nYet you turned a back somersault in at the door\x97\r\nPray, what is the reason of that?\r\n\r\nIn my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\r\nI kept all my limbs very supple\r\nBy the use of this ointment\x97one shilling the box\x97\r\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\r\n\r\nYou are old, said the youth,  and your jaws are too weak\r\nFor anything tougher than suet;\r\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the back\x97\r\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\r\n\r\nIn my youth, said his father, I took to the law,\r\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\r\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nYou are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose\r\nThat your eye was steady as ever;\r\nYet, you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\x97\r\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\r\n\r\nI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\r\nSaid his father. Don\'t give yourself airs!\r\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\r\nBe off, or I\'ll kick you downstairs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBLE WITH GERANIUMS\r\nby Mervyn Peake\r\n\r\nThe trouble with geraniums\r\nis that they\x92re much too red!\r\nThe trouble with my toast is that\r\nit\x92s far too full of bread.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with a diamond\r\nis that it\x92s much too bright.\r\nThe same applies to fish and stars\r\nand the electric light.\r\n\r\nThe troubles with the stars I see\r\nlies in the way they fly.\r\nThe trouble with myself is all\r\nself-centred in the eye.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with my looking-glass\r\nis that it shows me, me;\r\nthere\x92s trouble in all sorts of things\r\nwhere it should never be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crocodile or, Public Decency\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nThough some at my aversion smile,\r\nI cannot love the crocodile.\r\nIts conduct does not seem to me\r\nConsistent with sincerity.\r\n\r\nWhere Nile, with beneficial flood,\r\nImproves the desert sand to mud,\r\nThe infant child, its banks upon,\r\nWill run about with nothing on.\r\nThe London County Council not\r\nBeing adjacent to the spot,\r\nThis is the consequence. Meanwhile,\r\nWhat is that object in the Nile,\r\nWhich swallows water, chokes and spits?\r\nIt is the crocodile in fits.\r\n\r\n\'Oh infant! oh my country\'s shame!\r\nSuppose a European came!\r\nPicture his feelings, on his pure\r\nPersonally conducted tour!\r\nThe British Peer\'s averted look,\r\nThe mantling blush of Messrs. Cook!\r\nCome, awful infant, come and be\r\nDressed, if nothing else, in me.\'\r\n\r\nThen disappears into the Nile\r\nThe infant, clad in crocodile,\r\nAnd meekly yields his youthful breath\r\nTo darkness, decency, and death.\r\nHis mother, in the local dells,\r\nDeplores him with Egyptian yells:\r\nHer hieroglyphic howls are vain,\r\nNor will the lost return again.\r\nThe crocodile itself no less\r\nDisplays, but does not feel, distress,\r\nAnd with its tears augments the Nile;\r\nThe false, amphibious crocodile.\r\n\r\n\'Is it that winds Etesian blow,\r\nOr melts on Ethiop hills the snow?\'\r\nSo, midst the inundated scene,\r\nInquire the floating fellaheen.\r\nFrom Cairo\'s ramparts gazing far\r\nThe mild Khedive and stern Sirdar\r\nSay, as they scan the watery plain,\r\n\'There goes that crocodile again.\'\r\nThe copious tribute of its lids\r\nSubmerges half the pyramids,\r\nAnd over all the Sphinx it flows,\r\nExcept her non-existent nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling English Road\r\nby G. K. Chesterton\r\nBefore the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,\r\nThe rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.\r\nA reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,\r\nAnd after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;\r\nA merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread\r\nThe night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.\r\n\r\nI knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,\r\nAnd for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;\r\nBut I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed\r\nTo straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,\r\nWhere you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,\r\nThe night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.\r\n\r\nHis sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run\r\nBehind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?\r\nThe wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,\r\nBut the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.\r\nGod pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear\r\nThe night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.\r\n\r\nMy friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,\r\nOr stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,\r\nBut walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,\r\nAnd see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;\r\nFor there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,\r\nBefore we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventures Of Isabel \r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nIsabel met an enormous bear,\r\nIsabel, Isabel, didn\'t care;\r\nThe bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,\r\nThe bear\'s big mouth was cruel and cavernous.\r\nThe bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,\r\nHow do, Isabel, now I\'ll eat you!\r\nIsabel, Isabel, didn\'t worry.\r\nIsabel didn\'t scream or scurry.\r\nShe washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,\r\nThen Isabel quietly ate the bear up.\r\nOnce in a night as black as pitch\r\nIsabel met a wicked old witch.\r\nthe witch\'s face was cross and wrinkled,\r\nThe witch\'s gums with teeth were sprinkled.\r\nHo, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,\r\nI\'ll turn you into an ugly toad!\r\nIsabel, Isabel, didn\'t worry,\r\nIsabel didn\'t scream or scurry,\r\nShe showed no rage and she showed no rancor,\r\nBut she turned the witch into milk and drank her.\r\nIsabel met a hideous giant,\r\nIsabel continued self reliant.\r\nThe giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,\r\nHe had one eye in the middle of his forhead.\r\nGood morning, Isabel, the giant said,\r\nI\'ll grind your bones to make my bread.\r\nIsabel, Isabel, didn\'t worry,\r\nIsabel didn\'t scream or scurry.\r\nShe nibled the zwieback that she always fed off,\r\nAnd when it was gone, she cut the giant\'s head off.\r\nIsabel met a troublesome doctor,\r\nHe punched and he poked till he really shocked her.\r\nThe doctor\'s talk was of coughs and chills\r\nAnd the doctor\'s satchel bulged with pills.\r\nThe doctor said unto Isabel,\r\nSwallow this, it will make you well.\r\nIsabel, Isabel, didn\'t worry,\r\nIsabel didn\'t scream or scurry.\r\nShe took those pills from the pill concocter,\r\nAnd Isabel calmly cured the doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther nonsense verse of note:\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five by William Shakespeare\r\nThe Mad Gardener\'s Song by Lewis Carroll\r\nThe Lobster Quadrille by Lewis Carroll\r\nThe Crocodile by Lewis Carroll\r\nThe Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear\r\nThe Dong with the Luminous Nose by Edward Lear\r\nThe Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo by Edward Lear\r\nThe Jumblies by Edward Lear\r\nHow Pleasant to Know Mr. Lear! by Edward Lear\r\nBallad of the Breadman by Charles Causley \r\nSilly Verse for Kids by Spike Milligan, including On the Ning Nang \r\nNong \r\nA Book of Nonsense by Mervyn Peake\r\nThe Pocket Full of Boners by Dr. Seuss (1931)\r\nHejji by Dr. Seuss (1935)\r\nHorton Hatches the Egg by Dr. Seuss (1940)\r\nAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street by Dr. Seuss (1937)\r\nIf I Ran the Zoo by Dr. Seuss (1950)\r\nHorton Hears a Who! by Dr. Seuss (1954)\r\nIf I Ran the Circus by Dr. Seuss (1956)\r\nThe Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss (1957)\r\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss (1957)\r\nYertle the Turtle by Dr. Seuss (1958)\r\nThe Cat in the Hat Comes Back by Dr. Seuss (1958)\r\nGreen Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss (1960)\r\nThe Lorax by Dr. Seuss (1971)\r\nOh, the Places You\'ll Go by Dr. Seuss (1990)\r\nThe Great Panjandrum Himself by Samuel Foote\r\nThe Crocodile, or Public Decency by A.
