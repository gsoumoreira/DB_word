E. Cummings rephrased the term. There \nare many examples of ethnic cleansing and genocide in human history, including \nthe Holocaust, the Trail of Tears and the Palestinian Nakba (a catastrophe that \ncontinues to this day, funded by American taxpayer dollars and supported by \nadvanced American weapons). \n\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch,\nan editor \nand publisher of Holocaust and\nNakba poetry\n\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby T. Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\n\n\nPalestine by Houda Shams\n\nEthnic cleansing and genocide are the most terrible crimes known to humanity. \nAnd yet the United States, which claims to be the world leader on human rights, \njustice and democracy, has produced three Holocausts: (1) the Trail \nof Tears, which caused millions of completely innocent Native American women and \nchildren to suffer and die prematurely; (2) American slavery, which \ncaused millions of completely innocent African American women and children to \nsuffer and die prematurely; and (3) the Nakba (Arabic for \nCatastrophe), which continues to this day and has caused millions of completely innocent Palestinian\nwomen and children to suffer, and many to die prematurely. To cause the premature death of an innocent person is \nmurder. To cause the premature deaths of large numbers of \ninnocent people because of their race or ethnicity is genocide. \nWhen will the United States ever live up to its stated ideals, and end the wholesale \nethnic cleansing and slaughter of innocents abetted by its financial aid and weapons \nsales to Israel, a nation that insists Jewish babies are born with infinitely \ngreater rights than non-Jewish babies, then herds the inferior babies into \ngiant walled corrals? The millions of completely innocent \nPalestinian women and children who suffer inside the walled ghetto of Gaza, the \nwalled bantustans of Occupied Palestine and refugee camps across the Middle East \nnever did anything to harm Americans. So what right do Americans have, to say that\nthey should live and die as rightless serfs on their native land? Why does the United States \npreach equal rights and democracy to the rest of the world, while always \ndenying Palestinians any possible chance of equal rights and self-determination?\n\n\n\nInternational Quds Day by Mojtaba62\n\nThe poems on this page protest such injustices, and call for compassion and \nequality for all human beings, without excuses. How is it possible that American \npresidents and presidential candidates can deny that Palestinians mothers and their \nchildren deserve equal rights and justice? Why is what once happened to \ndarker-skinned Native Americans \nand African Americans now happening to darker-skinned Palestinians? How is that \nnot racism of the worst kind? Since the direct result of \nthe Nakba was 9-11 and two terrible, decade-long wars, what has been the real \ncost of American racism, hubris and hypocrisy, but hundreds of thousands of \nlives lost, and trillions of dollars down the drain?\nI am reminded of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in his I Have A Dream \nspeech: The whirlwind of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our Nation \nuntil the bright day of Justice emerges. We need to do abroad what \nwe have done within our own borders: stop favoring the Chosen Few over other \npeople, or the people we deprive of justice will rebel against us, just as \nAmericans once rebelled against the British monarchy. \n\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\n\n\n\nAt Least, Save Children by Fidia95\n\n\nThis is a page of poetry about ethnic cleansing and genocide, about \nHolocausts and the horrors human beings inflict on each other ... even on \ncompletely innocent women and children.\n\nEpitaph for a Sahrawi Child\n\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI was only a child \nin the Saharan wild.\n\nWhat matter  my death\nas long as you draw breath?\n\nForget me  I die.\nNever ask yourselves, Why? \n\nBloodshed in the Sahara:\nThe Sins of Colonialism\nand the Plight of the Sahrawi People\n\nis the latest addition to our Genocide Poetry Index: the one we really, really \nwish we didn\'t have to keep updating.\n\nOgaden Poetry is a page dedicated to the \nOgaden people of Somalia. Somalis have been known to the world, at least since \nRichard Burton\'s time, as a nation of poets.  Cedric \nBarnes, University of London\n\n\n\n\nThe poem\n\nAuschwitz Rose \nby Michael R. Burch\nis dedicated to all victims\nand survivors of the \nHolocaust, and their \nfamilies. Never again! \nTo read the poem, and \nfor an explanation of the\nimage above, please click\nthe title of the poem. \n\n\nMake no mistake about it ... there have been many \nHolocausts in human history. Please consider the images of the Jewish children \nbelow, and please also consider the plight of American slaves, and of Native \nAmericans who were forced to walk the Trail of Tears, and of the children of \nDarfur and Gaza today.\tf you are a student, teacher, educator, peace activist or just someone who \ncares and wants to help, please read \n\nHow Can We End Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide Forever?\nand do what you can to make the world a safer, happier place for \nchildren of all races and creeds.\n\n\n\nThe Holocaust was the horror of all horrors, but sometimes one horror leads to another because today the Jewish Shoah (Hebrew for \nCatastrophe) is being used to excuse the Palestinian Nakba (Arabic for Catastrophe). Jews and Christians \nalso use the Bible to condone this terrible new Holocaust by saying that God gave the land of \nPalestine to the ancient Hebrew tribes, when in reality the Bible clearly \nsays that the land was taken by ethnic cleansing and genocide, the slaying \nof everything that breathes. If God gave the land to Moses, Joshua and \nKing David, why does the Bible relate how time and time again they \nslaughtered defenseless women and children in the process of taking it? How is it possible that in the 21st century \nhuman beings continue to use religious texts to excuse collective punishment and \nthe ethnic cleansing and genocide of innocents? How can rich, powerful Jews and Americans \ncontinue to wage a senseless war of attrition against the suffering children of \nGaza and Occupied Palestine? Is land, money or political influence worth the \nterrible price of the lives of so many innocent women and children?\n\nNeglect\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat good are your tears?\nThey will not spare the dying their anguish.\nWhat good is your concern\nto a child sick of living, waiting to perish?\n\nWhat good, the warm benevolence of tears\nwithout action?\nWhat help, the eloquence of prayers,\nor a pleasant benediction?\n\nBefore this day is gone,\nhow many more will die\nwith bellies swollen, wasted limbs,\nand eyes too parched to cry?\n\nI fear for our souls\nas I hear the faint lament\nof their souls departing ...\nmournful, and distant.\n\nHow pitiful our effort,\nyet how fatal its effect.\nIf they died, then surely we killed them,\nif only with neglect.\n\n\n\nThe ethnic cleansing and genocides of the children of Darfur and Palestine are \ncrimes against peace and humanity. Obviously, the women and children of Darfur \nand Palestine are not terrorists ...\n\n\n\n\n... so why are they being collectively punished? Of course it was wrong for the \nNazis to collectively punish Jewish women and children during the Holocaust. But \nsurely it is just as wrong for the government of Israel to punish Palestinian \nwomen and children collectively today (just think of the movies District 9 and \nAvatar to understand their dilemma) ... \n\nThe pictures on the left are of the Jewish Shoah. The pictures on the right are \n\tvery similar pictures of the Palestinian Nakba \n... \n\n\n\n\nWe Love Gaza\n\n\nI live in Gaza. \nMy hope for the future is to free Palestine. \n\nLiving in Gaza is like living in prison. \nThe borders are closed, no airport like \nother countries, wars, people dying.\nWe want freedom like other countries. \nWhen I hear bombing Ill \nbe afraid. \nI really really wish for freedom.\nFREE GAZA.\nThe Child Poets of Gaza\n\n\n\n\nMy nightmare\n\nI had a dream of Jesus! \nMama, his eyes were so kind!\nBut behind him I saw many Jews and Christians\nhissing You\'re nothing! So blind!\nThe Child Poets of Gaza\n\n\n\nI am just fourteen\n\n\nHot tears racing down my cheeks\nDeep wounds that shall never heal\nDreams of peace that had already ceased\nCorpses, blood everywhere\nGreed is to blame\nBeauty and peace no longer there\nJust in fantasies they lay\nSouls and objects full of life\nEaten away by fresh fire\nDestruction, deception that is left\nWhat good will they get\nMurder, death of loved ones\nFilling hearts with bitterest desires\nTerror and fear surrounding me\nClosing in upon me\nI stand silent, in a silent scream\nThat nobody can hear\nFor Gods sake I am just fourteen!\nThe Child Poets of Gaza\n\n\n\nWhen I am President\n\nWhen I am president, I will be the president of Spain because I love Spain a \nlot. \nI will live in Barcelona and the first thing I will do \nis that I will \ncollect my army and go save Palestine \nand control Israel and give it back to \nPalestine.\nI will buy limousines, Jeeps, phones, laptops and bodyguards. \n\nI will make everybody happy and I will let everybody call me the best president \never!\nPeace!!!\nThe Child Poets of Gaza\n\n\n\nI have a dream ...\n\nI have a dream ... \nthat one day Jews and Christians\nwill see me as I am:\na small child, lonely and afraid,\nstaring down the barrels of their big bazookas,\nknowing I did nothing\nto deserve this. \nThe Child Poets of Gaza\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffering in Gazathrough the eyes of a teenager\n\n\nI want to write about the suffering of the people in these days of siege...\n\nWe cant get basic thingsI think that there is no future for \nusI mean for Gazas people. There is no safe place we can go there, even we \ncant communicate with our friends because networks are down. Our life is \ncentered around those who have been killed.\n\nThere is horror every minute and its clear, especially in the \nlives of children\n\nI just want to ask the people who are living outside of Gaza...\n\nImagine your life with no electricity or basic things? \nDestroyed home, a lot of children who dont have parents, the sounds just like \nthe roll of thunderBOOMall the time. Imagine your children tell you through \ntheir eyes and cries, We are afraid, we cant take it anymore and we cant even \nsleep!\n\nImagine yourself with no one beside you, to take care of you \nor even to look after youand the people around you are strangersHow long \ncould you stand it?\n\nIf the world stood with us we will not stand it any longer or \nanymore. But unfortunately there is no doings just other people who are trying \nto help us by saying words, not more. They dont do for us any good things.\n\nWe are now better than before, at least we can go to school \neveryday instead of seeing others dying.\n\nI hope Gaza will change and be as the other countrieswe just \nhave to pray all the time!\n\nWe just want PEACE.\n\n\n\nLiving in Gaza\n\nLiving in Gaza is not always easy. When I came to Gaza, I did not believe what I \nsaw. I saw buildings that were bombed, houses that were burned and people who \nwere happy. I didnt think people could be happy living like this. Now that I \nhave been in Gaza for months, I realized that we dont need to have the best \nstores, the best restaurants, or the best houses. As long as we have our friends \nand family, we can be happier than the people who have those things.\n\nWhile I am in Gaza, I have learned to make better use of my \ntime. I used to think that when the power goes out it would be hard to do \nanything. You actually can have a fun game or talk to your cousins. I cant say \nI hate Gaza because it is where I am from so I am happy here. I am proud of \nwhere I am from and happy to be here.\n\n\n\nMy Hope for the Future\n\n\nFuture  its a big word for me and I have a lot of dreams. One of my dreams for \nthe future is that I want to be a journalist. Two years ago I decided to be a \njournalist because I saw that my friend was so happy with that work and I like \nto write and take photos and things like that. These days, I started to think \nabout that idea.\n\nMy friend is Egyptian and she traveled to China, India, Iraq  \nall those places, so I thought of being a journalist just like that; traveling, \nshopping, taking some photos and writing essays but I forgot that I live in Gaza \nand those things are impossible for us.\n\nI cant travel at any time or write anything here. No one \nwrites anything except about war and enemies (Israel) so my dream started to \nvanish.\n\nNow I dont know what I want to be and have no dream.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving in Gaza\n\n\nLiving in Gaza is like living in a cage. We cant travel, we cant take our own \nopinion and we should always be ready for anything unexpected to happen, such as \na bomb far or nearby, war or a problem anywhere. You could even be kidnapped for \na political reason.\n\nIn Gaza, each day that passes by, there should be 8 hours \nwithout electricity.\n\nBut, whatever you hear about us...we are powerful, we are \nstrong and we have brave people but we dont have the minds to work on our case. \nWe sometimes make ourselves happy just to run away from worries. Its as making \nourselves confident.\n\nIn Gaza, the only thing stopping us from peace is that we \nshould be on one side, not including the games of political parties. We also, in \nGaza, share anything around the world. We are people the same as any country. I \nguess so!!!! \n\nThe things that we love in Gaza is our friends and family. It \nis the only thing that we are alive for!!\n\n\n\nIn the Future\n\n\nIn the future, I will make a factory for cars and I will make it in Gaza because \nGaza doesnt have a car factory. I will make a car company and I will sell them \nto Gazas people and I will give them to my dad and mom. I will give each of \nthem two cars and to my brothers I will give them each two cars. My uncle will \nlet me study with him and I will give him the latest model. I will bring a quad \nfor myself. I want the quad now.\n\nThe future will be nicer than we are now.\n\n\n\nSuffer the Little Children\n\nby Nakba\n\nI saw the carnage . . .\nsaw girls\' dreaming heads\nblown to red atoms,\nand their dreams with them . . .\n\nsaw babies liquefied\nin burning beds\nas, horrified,\nI heard their murderers phlegm . . . \n\nI saw my mother stitch\nmy shrouds black hem,\nfor in that moment\nI was one of them . . .\n\nI saw our Fathers eyes\ngrow hard and bleak\nto see frail roses severed at the stem . . .\n\nHow could I fail to speak?\n\n\n\nThe oppressed can but pursue suitable tracks\nLearning to heed the lessons of awesome war\nBut will the mighty listen to reasons voice\nThat justice will accomplish the peace of Rome?\nOr will consciences dictates be inexorably ignored\nAs wars clouds hover over cultures great cradle?\nAnd yet we do not harbor the odium of hatred\nBut pray that peace can still be humanitys finest hour\nKhaled Nusseibeh\n\n\n\nDjembe Drum Beat\nby Debbie Amirault Camelin\n\nHe placed his brown hand over mine\nstopped my rhythm-less banging \nand pulled the drum away \nto cradle in his legs \nand caress the taunt skin\nof the carved conical drum\ncomforting it against my assault.\n\nI folded my hands in my lap\nthe proper lady thing to do\nwhen defeat feels imminent.\nI offered, There is a rhythm in me\nbut its buried deep.\nVery deep, he assured me.\n\nWe continued the lesson\nleft hand gradually grasping the beat\nright hand perfectly tone-deaf.\n\n\n\n\nSkull Trees, South Sudan\n\n\nAdrie Kusserow\n\n\tArok, hiding from the Arabs in the branches of a tree, \n\ttwo weeks surviving on leaves, \n\tlegs numb, mouth dry.\n\tWhen the mosquitoes swarmed\n\tand the bodies settled limp as petals under the trees,\n\the shinnied down, scooping out a mud pit with his hands \n\tsliding into it like a snake, \n\this whole body covered except his mouth.\n\tPerhaps others were near him,\n\tlying in gloves of mud, sucking bits of air through the swamp holes, \n\tmosquitoes biting their lips, \n\tbut he dared not look.\n\n\tWhat did he know of the rest of South Sudan, \n\tpockmarked with bombs,\n\tskull trees with their necklaces of bones, \n\tpacks of bony Lost Boys\n\troving like hyenas towards Ethiopia,\n\ttongues, big as toads, swelling in their mouths,\n\n\tthe sky pouring its relentless bombs of fire. Of course they were\n\ttempted to lie down for a moment,\n\n\tunder the lone tree, with its barely shade,\n\tto rest just a little while before moving on, \n\n\tthe days passing slyly, hallucinations\n\tfloating like kites above them\n\tuntil the blanched bones lay scattered in a \n\tring around the tree,\n\ttiny ribs, skulls, hip bonesa tea set overturned,\n\tas the hot winds whistled through them \n\tas they would anything, really,\n\n\tand the sky, finally exhausted,\n\tmoving on.\n\t\n\n\n\nDarfur (Jesus Wept)\nby William F.

Merrill\n\nYou, who read no calm reportings\nOf alien, distant, dire events,\nBut shriek and keen as loves go down\nBeyond all help, to violence;\nWhose temple\'s walls, stormstruck and split\nBy sizzling bolts collapse around,\nWhile mid the crash of chaos hope\nWhirls in a death-spin to the ground;\nYou, who alone in deep distress\nCry out for help where there is none,\nAll you whom I shall never know:\nI know a portion nonetheless \nOfcruel trials you undergo.\n\nKillers in many guises come: \nSudden as electric shock\nOr looming ghostly as a shark\nLeisurely finning toward its mark.\nI who breathless and sweating once\nWrestled a devil to the floor,\nAnd saw him rise again when he\nFinished what he began before,\nI who re-learned each childhood prayer\nForgotten,to the stars once more\nSend up apoor and hopeless plea\nFor spirit\'s peace beyond despair.\n\n\n\n\n\nTears of Darfur\nby Mahnaz Badihian\n\nO tired land\nO depressed sky of Darfur\nO plain of no breath\nYou are bleeding from all corners\nOf your dreams\nThe bosom of your land\nWeeps the bitterness of blood\nO tearful Darfur,\nCan your hungry hands \nOne day cultivate those \nDry, sad roots, left from\nThe countless bones \nOf your children\nCan your simple dreams\nOf having a\nLoaf of bread and a roof above\nCome through?\nMaybe,\nMaybe one day\nThose broken wings \nWill heal \nWith the caressing hands \nOf peace\nWe the people of the world \nWith our tearful eyes \nWaiting on the day that \nAcacias will bloom \nOn the lands where \nThe dream of innocence pours\nOn these hopeless days\n\n\n\n\n\nWar Metaphysics for a Sudanese Girl\n\n\nAdrie Kusserow\n\n\nI leave the camp, unable to breathe, \n\nme Freud girl, after her interior,\nshe Lost Girl, after my purse, \n\nher face: \ndark as eggplant,\nher gaze: \nunpinnable, untraceable, \nfloating, open, defying the gravity\nI was told keeps pain in place. \n\nMaybe trauma doesn\'t harden, \npacked, tight as sediment at the bottom of her psyche,\ndry and cracked as the desert she crossed, \nmaybe memory doesn\'t stalk her \nwith its bulging eyes. \n\nOnce inside the body \ndoes war move up or down,\nmaybe the body pisses it out, \nmaybe it dissipates, like sweat and fog\nunder the heat of a colonial God, \nand in America, maybe it flavors dull muzungu lives,\neach refugee a bouillon cube of horror. \n\nMaybe war can\'t be soaked up\nby humans alone, \nthe way the rains in Sudan\nmove across the land, \ndrenching the ground, animals, camps, sky,\nno end to its roaming \nuntil further out, among the planets,\na stubborn galaxy finally mops it up,\nand it sits, hushed, \nred, sober, \n\nand below, the humans in the north\nwith their penchant for denial,\nnaming it aurora borealis. \n\n*Muzungu means white person in many Bantu languages of east, central and \nSouth Africa  \n\n\n\n\nMilk\n\n\nAdrie Kusserow\n\nSudanese Refugee Camp, Northwest Uganda\n\nI.\n\nOur drivers gun insanely over the dusty, red roads,\nlurching from pothole to pothole. \nCaravan of slick, adrenalized vans, \n\ntattooed with symbols of western aid, \nWill on my lap, trying to nurse between bumps,\nmy hands a helmet to his bobbing skull. \n\nA three-legged goat hobbles to the side \nand though we imagine we are a huge interruption,\nwomen balancing jeri cans on their heads, face our wake\nof dust and rage as they would any other gust of wind\n\nWater, sun, NGO. \n\nWe arrive covered in orange dust, coughing,\nfleet of SUVs parked under the trees, \nengines cooling, Star Trekkian cockpits flashing, \n\nalarms beeping and squawking as we zip-lock them up \nand leave them black-windowed, self-contained as UFO\'s. \n\nBehind the gate, we stumble through the boiling, shoulder deep sun,\nWill and I trying to play soccer \nas a trickle of Sudanese kids cross the road \n\nhanging against the fence, watching the chubby Muzungu boy\nI\'ve toted around Africa like a pot of gold. \nThree years old, he knows they\'re watching, so he does a little \ndance,\nhis SpiderMan shoes lighting up as he kicks the ball. \n\nII. \n\nPart African bush, part Wild West, \nwe\'re based in Arua, grungy, dusty frontiertown, \ngiant dieseled trucks barrel through, spreading their wake of \nadrenalin,\nobese sacks of grain lying like walrus inside. \n\nI chase Will from malarial puddle to puddle,\nwhite blouse frilled like a gaudy gladiola,\nlavish concern for my chubby son\nsuddenly rococo, absurd.\n\nIII. \n\n7 foot giants of the SPLA, huddle together, drinking,\ntalking Dinka politics, repatriation, the New Sudan, \nwives lanky as giraffes, set food on the table and disappear.\n\n\nIn candlelight the men\'s forehead scars gleam\nI flutter around them acting more deferential than I\'m used to,\nslowly I\'m learning Sudanese grammar\nmen, verbs, women, the conjunctions that link them together. \n\nIn the thick of rain we walk home, \nUgandans huddled under their makeshift bird cages, \nWill now pointing to the basic vocabulary of this road\n\ndead snake, prickly bush, squealing pig, peeing child. \nThree drunk men huddled at a shack \nscrape the whiteness off us as we walk by.\n\nThough I don\'t want to hear it,\nthough I love Africa, \nit starts up anyway, the milky mother cells of my body high-fiving,\nmy mind quietly repeating the story of my son\'s lucky birth, \nhis rich American inheritance. \n\nIV.\n\nMy husband drops into bed, dragging a thick cloak of requests. \nAll day, I\'ve labored behind him, toting our clueless muzungu,\nwatching him, dogged Dutchman in his rubber clogs \n\nclimbing the soggy hills of Kampala, despite the noonday heat,\na posse of hopeful Lost Boys following him.\nHe, afraid of nothing, really; not even death,\nme afraid of everything really, most of all his death. \n\nIn the distance, trucks rev up to cross the bush \nwhere Sudanese families perched like kites caught in trees,\nwait for the next shipment.\n\nBut it\'s night now, \nthe three of us inside the cloud chamber of our mosquito net,\nthe two of them breathing, safe. \n\nWill\'s nursing again, though he doesn\'t need to,\nswelling like a tick \nand though I don\'t want to love \n\nthe sweet mists of our tiny tent home,\nthe lush wetlands of our lives, \nits thick rope bridges and gentle Ugandan hills, \n\nthe fat claw of my heart rises up,\nfertile, lucky, random \npulsing its victory song.\n\n\n\n\nMud\n\n\nAdrie Kusserow\n\nI.\n\nThe pond black and bulging, \nice storm ruins poking from the water \nlike the stiff feet of, dare I say, fallen soldiers.\nRobert still in Sudan, \nback in Vermont, the kids and I limp through two weeks of cold rain, \n\nI drape Ana and Will in rain gear \nwatch the drunken tents run across the field. \nAna plunks her chubby toes into a fleet of tadpoles\ncold mud sucking her foot into its mouth. \n\nI drag the branches onto shore, \nglobs of frog eggs surface like transparent brains,\nAna cupping the dimpled jelly, \nthe dogs licking it like caviar. \nEntranced, she squeezes it \nuntil I tell her to stop \nbefore she crushes the eggs. \n\nI tell myself it\'s not quite violence but over eager love,\nthis lust with which they squeeze the living, \nsmearing the mud onto their own limbs. \nBut what of this blur \nbetween awe and destruction,\nlove and violence? \n\nAt night, the peepers, \nscreaming themselves into existence.\nTwo frogs griplocked onto a female, \nher flesh bulging between their swollen fingers. \nThey\'re wrestling, I say, not wanting to reveal the darker side of their \nmating. \n\nI gingerly pry the males off, Will cheering,\nAna serious and methodic \nuntil she finally dislodges the last one\'s grip with her twig\nand they fall apart wriggling in the grass. \n\nII. \n\nThe rains just started in Juba, south Sudan,\nmaking travel, and maybe war, near impossible. \nStill my husband pushes a saggy jeep for eight hours\nthrough four feet of mud, a Sudanese boy \nlying unconscious in the back seat. \n\nThe jeep rocking and lurching \non the only road cleared of mines \nas my husband tries to inch it forward, this, his own labor of love, \nlike birth, like sex, something always tears, \nhis foot jammed with a thorn as he heaves and sinks\nhis toenail tearing off, until even he gives up \nand forces them to turn back, \nstill 40 miles from Aliab, the whole village waiting for them, \ncaught in an outbreak of cholera, \nits one river littered with rusty ammunition,\ntrucks large as elephants lying on their sides. \n\nWhen Abraham, their Lost Boy,* came home after 18 years,\nthe elders sacrificed a white cow. \nJump over it, into peace, they cried \nwhile the women tipped their thin necks back,\ntheir whips of ululation uncoiling in the heat. \n\nIII. \n\nThe frogs, still wiggling on the grass, \nAna clutches the tan-pink female, \ndespite its eerie mask, she wants to take it home. \nI tell her just one night, \nthen we\'ll let it go back to its real home\nbut the next morning it\'s done the impossible,\njumped out of its three foot fortress. \n\nI roam the rooms crazed, desperate to find it.\nI do, \na day later, shrunken in the comer of the bathroom \nbut still breathing. I race it to the pond, \nchildren confused behind me, \nwatch it sink, stunned, then lethargically swim away, \nstill dried and wrinkled, despite its immersion in water,\nlike Abraham, now more American than Sudanese,\nsitting wide-eyed and stiff amidst the wailing and singing. \n\nIV. \n\nRobert home, worn out, but safe.\nI take a walk to the pond and find\na tan-pink frog, perhaps the same one,\nfloating in the water,\nI can\'t tell if it\'s alive or dead. \n\nI know how I came to be married to this man,\nI followed him from country to country,\ngripped him hard as the frogs\nStill he did not peel me off, as I have tried to do \nwith his over eager love, for this gangly, barren country of Sudan.\nWho knows what will be torn next, \nit\'s just what happens when you love the world\nand you move blindly, but well intentioned,\namidst the irresistible mud.\n\n*The Lost Boys refers to the 17,000 children in southern Sudan \nwho fled \ntheir homes in 1987 seeking refuge from the civil war. They walked 1,000 miles \nbefore they finally found protection in a Kenyan refugee camp, Kaukuma.

again,\nChanging irrevocably and forever.\nThe six-hundred-year history of Hiroshima\nDisappeared in the ashes,\nOn this Judgment Day, on this Morning!\n\n(i)\nBlameless souls forever vanish\non this morning, this judgment day.\nOur silent cries, to heaven we appeal,\nscattered like the ash of withered leaves.\nOur ebbing souls\ncling to that lonely sky;\nwe try in vain to escape this sea of flame.\nOh, Hiroshima, once my haven,\nwhy has your life been sacrificed?\n\n(ii)\nThe abounding sadness within my heart . . .\ndrowning my loneliness in tears of self-pity.\nFour abandoned children;\nwishing to feel our mother\'s love,\njust once more;\nif only in our dreams.\nThe heat of yet another long night lingers.\nOh, Hiroshima, once my home,\nmy tears run dry waiting for the breaking dawn.\n\n(iii)\nMy soul is torn by this rage inside,\nan orphan of war;\nwhy does this make me feel guilty?\nWhy do my neighbors turn away\nor, close their ears when I speak?\nBitterness poisons this innocent child,\nI madly waste away.\nOh, Hiroshima, once my cradle,\nI am waiting to die.\n\n(iv)\nGathering remnants of my courage,\nI stand alone in this notorious America, land of the enemy.\nAn outcast with slanted eyes,\nI fall before the indifference of strangers;\nsightlessly, they trample upon my dignity.\nThis life of anguish seems to be my destiny.\nPraying for death, I endure time.\nOh, Hiroshima, once my comfort,\nI am lost in dreams of revenge.\n\n(v)\nBudding leaves renew this tired place, this tired soul;\ngently the rain is embraced by your love,\ncomforting this savaged heart.\nA blade of grass emerges from the ashes,\nand my heart becomes a light,\nconnecting me to heaven.\nLiving for one another, this is my path!\nOh Hiroshima, forever my love,\nmay my life become a bridge from you and others.\n\n(vi)\nAt the dawn of the 21st century,\nwe honor this passage through darkness.\nWe must have the courage to enter\nthe void again . . . and again,\nemerging with the gift of new life.\nHealing only comes through learning to forgive\nand making peace with our past.\nOnly then, will the wind whisper:\nHibakusha, you have not lived in vain!\n\n\n\nCrisis (Darfur)\nby lungelo mbatha\n\nWont you help to sing the song of Bob Marley \nIf tis all we seem to have!\nFor how long shall they kill our PEOPLE\nGenocide after genocide\nWhilst
