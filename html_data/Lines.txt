The writers of the most beautiful \nlines in the English language includes names we\'d expect to find, \nsuch as William \nBlake, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Sappho, William \nShakespeare, Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde and William Butler Yeats. But there are \nalso less-well-known names here, such as Ernest Dowson, William Dunbar and \nMary Elizabeth Frye (the latter a housewife who only wrote one poem of note, and \nyet it may have become the most popular poem in the English language!). \n\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\npass into nothingness ...\nJohn Keats\n\r\nI love you as certain dark things are to be loved,\r\nin secret, between the shadow and the soul.\r\nPablo Neruda\r\n\r\n... you are whatever a moon has always meant \r\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you ...\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\ncompiled \nby Michael R.

As far as we know, she had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself.\n\nThe blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. \nIt was a small part of the pantomime.\nWallace Stevens, Thirteen Ways of Looking at a \nBlackbird\n\nI do not know which to prefer, \nThe beauty of inflections \nOr the beauty of innuendoes, \nThe blackbird whistling \nOr just after. \nWallace Stevens, Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\n\nI would like to be the air\nthat inhabits you for a moment\nonly. I would like to be that unnoticed\n that necessary.\nMargaret Atwood, Variation on the Word Sleep \n\nThe weight of the world is love.\nUnder the burden of solitude, \nunder the burden of dissatisfaction,\nthe weight, the weight we carry is love.\nAllen Ginsberg, Song\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\nAre full of passionate intensity. \nWilliam Butler Yeats, The Second Coming\n\nDown, down, down into the darkness of the grave\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; \nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. \nI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\nEdna St. Vincent Millay, Dirge Without Music\n\n\nAdlestrop\nbyEdward Thomas\n\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\nThe name, because one afternoon\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \n) \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\nSudden Light\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \nYou have been mine before,\n\nHow long ago I may not know:\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\n\nYour neck turned so,\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore. \n\n\nSong\nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\nWhoso List to Hunt\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\n\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\n\nBread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\n\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nPiano \nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nCome Slowly, Eden\nby Emily Dickinson\n\nCome slowlyEden\nLips unused to thee\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\nAs the fainting bee\n\nReaching late his flower,\nRound her chamber hums\nCounts his nectarsalights\nAnd is lost in balms!\n\nGo, Lovely Rose\nby Edmund Waller\n\n Go, lovely Rose,\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\n That now she knows,\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\n\nVIII from Sunday \nMorning\n\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\nOr old despondency of day and night,\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\n\nThe Garden\nby Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\n\n\nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth.\n\nIn her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\nLullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful ...\n\nThe Snow Man \nby \nWallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby T. Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\nTo Earthward\nby Robert Frost\n\nI had the swirl and ache\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\nThat when theyre gathered shake\nDew on the knuckle.\n\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\n\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\nby Walt Whitman\n\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\nTo Celia\nby Ben Jonson\n\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\n\nTears, Idle Tears\nby Lord Alfred Tennyson\n\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\n\nAcquainted With The Night \nby Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\n\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\n\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\n\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\n\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\nDover Beach\nby Matthew Arnold\n\nAh, love, let us be true\nTo one another! for the world which seems\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\n\nSong\nby John Donne\n\nGo and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,\nTell me where all past years are,\nOr who cleft the devils foot ...\n\n\nFull Fathom Five\nby William Shakespeare\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n Of his bones are coral made;\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n Nothing of him that doth fade\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\n Ding-dong.\nHark!
