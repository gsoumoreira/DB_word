It should come as no surprise that the greatest writers produced some of the greatest epigrams:  Shakespeare, Homer, Sappho, \r\nAristotle, Basho, Dante, Hafiz, Martial, Milton, Plato, Rumi, Socrates, Voltaire, Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, et al. But there are surprises as well. Superb epigrammists include \r\nMuhammad Ali, Woody Allen, Yogi Berra, Warren Buffett, Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, Marilyn Monroe, Ogden Nash, Dolly Parton and Mae West. Here are some quick examples, to hopefully whet your appetite for the \r\nfleetest of the art forms ...\r\n\r\nIt ain\'t braggin\' if you can back it up.Muhammad Ali, \r\nwho excelled at both\r\nTo err is human, but it feels divine.Mae West\r\nI\'m not offended by dumb blonde jokes because I\'m not dumb, and also I\'m not blonde.Dolly Parton\r\nIt takes a smart brunette to play a dumb blonde.Marilyn Monroe, who \r\nalso was neither blonde nor dumb\r\nA right delayed is a right denied.Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \r\nLittle sparks ignite great flames.Dante, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nSome cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.Oscar Wilde\r\nI didn\'t attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.Mark Twain\r\nThe depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I\'ll never be as good as a wall!Mitch Hedberg\r\nRaise your words, not their volume. Rain grows flowers, not thunder.Rumi, \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOther accomplished epigrammatists include Ambrose Bierce, William Blake, Lenny Bruce, \r\nAlbert Camus, George Carlin, Johnny Carson, Winston Churchill, Emily Dickinson, \r\nBob Dylan, Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, JFK, MLK, Abraham Lincoln,  \r\nGroucho Marx, Michel de Montaigne, Ronald Reagan, Don Rickles, Joan \r\nRivers, Chris Rock, Will Rogers, Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR, Seneca, Jon Stewart, Jonathan \r\nSwift, Robin Williams and Jonathan \r\nWinters.\r\n\r\nThese epigrams, quotes and famous sayings were compiled by Michael R. Burch, an editor and publisher of Holocaust, \r\nHiroshima, Trail of Tears and Nakba poetry.\r\n\r\nEnough.\r\nGabby Giffords\r\n\r\nThe single-word epigram above was a strong rebuke of the NRA and its \r\npowerful gun lobby after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre left 26 \r\nchildren and educators dead. The author, Gabrielle \r\nGiffords, is still \r\nrecovering from the debilitating injuries she suffered in another senseless \r\nmassacre, after being shot in the head and \r\nlosing part of her brain. Whether you agree with her position or not, it\'s hard to deny \r\nthe power of that single-word epigram: Enough.\r\n\r\nAfter 17 students and educators were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High \r\nSchool in Parkland, Florida, one of the survivors, Emma Gonzalez, gave an impassioned speech in \r\nwhich she cited the lies and excuses of the NRA, punctuating each one with an \r\nemphatic We call B.S.! The student activists and \r\ntheir supporters then employed poignant epigrams as hashtags, such as #Enough and \r\n#NeverAgain.\r\nWhen the United States finally implements sane gun control laws, such epigrams \r\nwill undoubtedly have played a role, in the form of calls to compassion, unity \r\nand action.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Years after we made Enough our headline epigram for this page, the April 2, 2018 \r\nissue of TIME featured five MSD students with the caption ENOUGH. \r\nYolanda Renee King, the granddaughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., echoed her \r\nfather\'s famous and world-shaking epigram when she said, I have a dream that \r\nENOUGH is ENOUGH!\r\n\r\nThe right epigram at the right time can send chills down our spines. It can call \r\nus to take a stand, to chart a new course, to alter the future by learning from \r\nand avoiding the errors of the past.\r\n\r\nMany hashtags and tweets are epigrams. Here\'s a poetic, rhyming tweet by one of \r\nthe student-activists that I found to be clever, wise and moving:\r\n\r\nChange is no longer near. Change is here. \r\n@AAlhanti\r\n(Adam Alhanti)\r\n\r\nI once tweeted a poetic \r\nepigram about tweets, apologies to Shakespeare:\r\n\r\na tweet\r\nby any other name\r\nwould be as fleet!\r\n@mikerburch (Michael R. \r\nBurch)\r\n\r\nEpigrams Defined\r\n\r\nBut what, exactly, is an epigram, and what do the producers of great \r\nepigrams have in common? Well, in short, epigrams are brief, pithy, hard-hitting \r\nsayings, and the great epigrammatists are keen students of humanity \r\nwho know how to get their points across in the form of verbal wallops. So the best epigrams are often wise, \r\nfunny or \r\nsnide commentary on human nature, societies and beliefs. For example:\r\n\r\nMen seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.Dorothy Parker\r\nThe ballot is stronger than the bullet.Abraham Lincoln\r\nA man may be a fool and not know it, but not if he is married.H. L. Mencken\r\nYour children need your presence more than your presents.Jesse Jackson\r\n\r\nHere\'s an epigram in the form of a quatrain that seems just as pertinent today as the day it was written:\r\n\r\nThese Strangers, in a foreign World,\r\nProtection asked of me\r\nBefriend them, lest Yourself in Heaven\r\nBe found a Refugee.\r\nEmily Dickinson\r\n\r\nHere\'s another with a similar theme:\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages \r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head whenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys \r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\nHafiz\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI love the wisdom and spirit of Hafiz in this subversive (pardon the pun) \r\nlittle epigram. I can see Trump putting refugees in cages, while Hafiz goes \r\naround letting them out for a moondance!\r\n\r\nHere are other powerful epigrams of the past:\r\n\r\nGive me liberty, or give me death.Patrick Henry\r\nI have not yet begun to fight.John Paul Jones\r\nI WILL BE HEARD.William Lloyd Garrison (an American abolitionist who risked his life to help end slavery)\r\nWE SHALL OVERCOME.the rallying cry of the American Civil Rights Movement\r\nI have a dream.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\r\n\r\nThe piece below is, in my opinion, the greatest epigram of all time, and the most \r\nworld-transforming poem. It was written by two accomplished poets, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin \r\nFranklin, in ringing iambic pentameter (the same meter employed in the great blank verse \r\nof William Shakespeare and John Milton):\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident,\r\nthat all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain unalienable rights;\r\nthat among these are Life, Liberty\r\nand the pursuit of Happiness.\r\nThomas Jefferson, with Benjamin Franklin\r\n\r\nAnd then there\'s this crazy bleeding-heart liberal do-gooder named Jesus, who is apparently still not getting through to his most fervent American disciples:\r\n\r\nWhatsoever ye do unto the least of these, my brethren, ye do it unto me.Jesus Christ\r\nBlessed are the peacemakers.Jesus Christ\r\nDo unto others as you would have them do unto you: this is the Law and the Prophets.Jesus Christ\r\n\r\nAre Trump and his supporters doing unto others as they would have done to \r\nthemselves? Aren\'t homeless refugee children the least of all our brethren? Would Jesus \r\nhelp white refugees of hurricanes, but not darker-skinned refugees of other \r\ncatastrophes such as poverty and cancer? Should our compassion be local to our \r\nown tribe only, or should it encompass the world? A good epigram can force us \r\nto look in the mirror, think, and re-examine our beliefs about ourselves, our \r\nneighbors and the larger world. Here\'s another epigram I think people of faith \r\nshould consider:\r\n\r\nHe does not believe, who does not live according to his belief.Sigmund Freud (perhaps the all-time best definition of hypocrisy)\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, the stand-up comedian\'s one-liner is also a form of epigram. Here are current \r\nexamples of the genre, taken from the 2016 American presidential campaign \r\ntrail:\r\n\r\nDonald Trump showed his birth certificate to reporters. Who cares about his \r\nbirth certificate? I want to know if that thing on his head has had its \r\nvaccinations.Craig Ferguson\r\nTeddy Roosevelt spoke softly and carried a big stick; Donald Trump speaks loudly \r\nand carries a big shtick.Michael R. Burch\r\nDonald Trump is the kind of person who goes to the Super Bowl and thinks the \r\npeople in the huddle are talking about him.Eric Schneiderman \r\n\r\nThe Best Donald Trump Jokes, Puns, Tweets and Quotations\r\n\r\nHere\'s some good advice an ancient poet might have written with someone like Donald Trump in mind:\r\n\r\nRaise your words, not their volume. Rain grows flowers, not thunder.Rumi, \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAnd with so much violence being triggered by bullying and the anger and resentment it produces, here are \r\nfour marvelous epigrams that should be considered by the bullies and their victims:\r\n\r\nWhatsoever ye do unto the least of these, my brethren, ye do it unto me.Jesus Christ\r\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.Eleanor Roosevelt\r\nTo belittle, you must be little.Kahlil Gibran\r\n\r\nAn unbending tree\r\nbreaks easily.\r\nLao Tzu, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the Golden Rule, which is common to many religions:\r\n\r\nDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.King James Bible\r\n\r\nAnd here is a related gem of wisdom, delivered by someone who is smarter than the average bear ...\r\n\r\nAnother golden rule\r\nis: don\'t lose your cool.\r\nYogi Bear\r\n\r\nAs the United States once again prepares to take from the poor to give to the rich, in the form of a tax cut, I am reminded of this epigram:\r\n\r\nWe all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free-market capitalism for the poor.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\r\n\r\nI also like this little prayer epigram by one of the great souls:\r\n\r\nHelp me to fling my life like a flaming firebrand into the gathering darkness of the world.Albert Schweitzer\r\n\r\nSometimes one epigram inspires another ...\r\n\r\nLove can be exquisite torture.Michael R. Burch \r\n(written after reading It\'s Only My Heart by Mirza Ghalib)\r\n\r\nOn the lighter, brighter side, epigrams can be wonderfully witty, ironic, sarcastic, even hilarious. For example:\r\n\r\nI wanted to be the first woman to burn her bra, but it would have taken the fire department four days to put it out.Dolly Parton\r\nI don\'t believe in astrology. I\'m a Sagittarius and we\'re very skeptical.Arthur C. Clarke\r\nThrough space, one thought kept crossing my mind: every part of this rocket was supplied by the lowest bidder.John Glenn\r\n\r\nHere are ironic epigrams that I call Redefinitions ...\r\n\r\nFanatic: someone who can\'t change his mind or the subject.Winston Churchill\r\nAppeaser: someone who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last.Winston \r\nChurchill \r\nLove: a temporary insanity curable by marriage.Ambrose Bierce\r\nScandal is gossip made tedious by morality.Oscar Wilde\r\nFaith: falling into the same old claptrap.Michael R. Burch\r\nReligion: the ties that blind.Michael R. Burch\r\nTrickle down economics: an especially pungent golden shower.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Epigrams\r\n\r\nIt\'s no accident that many of my favorite epigrams are by women. After all, the first great lyric poet of antiquity was Sappho of Lesbos; she wrote poems that were set to the \r\nmusic of a lyre (hence, the term lyric for a short poem). Thus, Sappho is the mother of lyric poets and singer-songwriters like Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan, Carole King, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, \r\nJoni Mitchell and Paul Simon.\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest epigrammists of all time were women: Sappho, Eleanor \r\nRoosevelt, Virginia Wolf, Emily Dickinson and others you will find on this page. \r\nTwo of my personal favorites may surprise youMae West and Marilyn Monroebut \r\nonce you\'ve read their insightful, wise and touching epigrams, I think you\'ll \r\nagree that they belong here.\r\n\r\nThis page also contains some of the greatest pithy sayings of all timefrom Sappho to Shakespeare, from Yogi Bear to Yogi Berra, from Rock to Tweetsalong \r\nwith information about the various types of epigrams, their history, and the \r\nfascinating people who penned them. I have worked with the interests \r\nof students young and old in mind, so if you want to learn more about epigrams \r\nwhile reading the exemplars, I think you\'ve discovered the right page. Here are a few quick examples:\r\n\r\nThe Top Ten Epigrams of All Time (in one person\'s opinion)\r\n\r\nIn the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.Albert Camus\r\nIt is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.Eleanor Roosevelt\r\nIf you can\'t be a good example, you\'ll just have to be a horrible warning.Catherine the Great\r\nIf life were fair, Elvis would be alive and his impersonators would be dead.Johnny Carson\r\nSome cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.Oscar Wilde\r\nTo err is human, but it feels divine.Mae West\r\nAn eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.Mohandas Gandhi\r\nFor most of history, Anonymous was a woman.Virginia Woolf\r\nI don\'t approve of political jokes; I have seen too many of them get \r\nelected.Jon Stewart \r\nPatriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it \r\ndeserves it.Mark \r\nTwain \r\n\r\nHere\'s another epigram that seems especially germane to the discussion at hand:\r\n\r\nImprove yourself through others\' writings, thus attaining more easily what they \r\nacquired through great difficulty.Socrates, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA major theme of this page is learning important lessons the Socratic wayby readingrather than by dire, difficult, often-harrowing experience. \r\nHere\'s a similar quote by Scotland\'s greatest poet, who was recently nominated as \r\nthe greatest Scotsman of all time in a Scottish TV poll:\r\n\r\nI pick my favourite quotations and store them in my mind as ready armour, offensive or defensive, amid the struggle of this turbulent existence.Robert Burns\r\n\r\nEpigrams about Epigrams\r\n\r\nWhat is an epigram? A dwarfish whole;\r\nIts body brevity, and wit its soul.\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nSince brevity is the soul of wit,\r\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\r\nI will be brief.\r\nWilliam Shakespeare\r\n\r\nEpigrams are short and well-seasoned.Thomas Campion\r\n\r\nTo write an epigram, cram.\r\nIf you lack wit, scram!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nCertain brief sentences are peerless in their ability to give one the feeling that nothing remains to be said.Jean Rostand\r\nEpigrams succeed where epics fail.Persian Proverb\r\n\r\nEpigrammatic Poems\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\nSappho, fragment 42, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLittle strokes\r\nfell great oaks.\r\nBen Franklin\r\n\r\nCandy\r\nis dandy,\r\nbut liquor\r\nis quicker.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nOh God of dust and rainbows, help us see\r\nthat without dust the rainbow would not be.\r\nLangston Hughes\r\n\r\nFlayed without hope, \r\nI held the man for nothing in my arms.\r\nJames Wright\r\n\r\nIf you\'re interested in epigrammatic poems, you can find a stellar collection \r\nat The Best \r\nShort Poems of All Time. The hyperlinked page features poems by \r\nmasters of humor, wit and irony, such as Ogden Nash, Edward Lear, Mother Goose, \r\nMartial, Hafiz, Li Po, Thomas Campion, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, e. e. cummings, John Dryden and Alexander Pope. \r\n\r\nEpigrams about Poetry and Writing\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to writing.

Kennedy\r\nIf by a Liberal they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the peopletheir health, their \r\nhousing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil libertiessomeone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if \r\nthat is what they mean by a Liberal, then I\'m proud to say I\'m a Liberal.John F. Kennedy\r\n\r\nIf you\'re looking for something in particular, you can use CTRL-F to find a word or phrase quickly, such as pun, aphorism, chiasmus, raillery, \r\nbon mot, love, sex, politics or a writer\'s name. Otherwise, please allow me to begin with a question: What does this colorful crowd of characters \r\nhave in common: Alexander the Great, Woody Allen, Aristotle, Yogi Berra, William Blake, Buddha, Churchill, Dante, Einstein, Jesus Christ, Gandhi, JFK, MLK, Lincoln, Michelangelo, Mohammed, \r\nMarilyn Monroe, Napoleon, Plato, Dolly Parton, Will Rogers, Eleanor Roosevelt, Shakespeare, Socrates, Mark Twain, Mother Teresa, Voltaire and Oscar Wilde?\r\n\r\nAnswer: They all produced immortal epigrams! Now here, to further whet your appetite, are some of the most touching epigrams ever written:\r\n\r\nWonderfully Moving, Poetic Epigrams\r\n\r\nThe births of all things are weak and tender, therefore we should have our eyes intent on beginnings.Michel de Montaigne\r\nEach has his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart, and his friends can only read the title.Virginia Woolf\r\nWe shall find peace.

For example, Jimi Hendrix \r\n(1942-1970) is often credited with the saying When the power of love \r\novercomes the love of power, the world will know peace. However, long \r\nbefore Hendrix was born the liberal British statesman William Gladstone \r\n(1809-1898) said: We look forward to the time when the Power of Love will \r\nreplace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of peace. \r\nLater, Sri Chinmoy \r\n(1931-2007) said: When the power of love overcomes the love of power, then \r\nthere will be true peace. Another good example of epigrams evolving over \r\ntime is this one \r\nby George Santayana: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \r\nit. There are now many variations of this saying, with the most common \r\nprobably being: Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.\r\n\r\nA Brief History of Epigrams\r\n\r\nAncient Greek epigrams may be the oldest genre of European literature \r\nand poetry. There are startling similarities between Greek epigrams and Oriental \r\nhaiku. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nbut go with good fortune:\r\nI wish you a kinder sea.\r\nPlato, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDeepening autumn:\r\nmy neighbor,\r\nhow does he continue?\r\nMatsuoBasho, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nJust as I select a ship when it\'s time to travel,\r\nor a house when it\'s time to change residences,\r\neven so I will choose when it\'s time to depart from life.\r\nSeneca, speaking about the right to euthanasia in the first century AD, \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest Greek epigrams were gravestone inscriptions, or \r\nepitaphs. The epigram attributed to Plato above could easily have appeared on \r\nthe headstone of an ancient mariner. Such early poems may have survived simply \r\nbecause they were carved in stone. The first uses of the term \r\nepigramma appear in the writings of Herodotus (circa 484425BC) and \r\nThucydides (circa 460395 BC), but the verses they cited may predate the references \r\nby three centuries or more. Sophocles (circa 497-406 BC) and Euripides (circa \r\n480-406 BC) also alluded to verse \r\ninscriptions, so the epigram was firmly established no later than the \r\nfourth century BC, probably much earlier.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph is a form of epigram. Here are two epigrams \r\ngleaned from Greek graves, which I have paraphrased, under the heading \r\nAthenian Epitaphs:\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gull\r\nin his high, lonely circuits, may tell.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Glaucus\r\n\r\nWas the first great poet a woman? Sappho (circa 630570 BC) predates many of her \r\ncelebrated male Greek peers. She remains stunningly fresh and relevant today. \r\nThe poem below could have been written by a modern girl or woman doubtfully \r\neying skimpy attire:\r\n\r\nA short revealing frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\nSappho, fragment 155, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere is my interpretation of a poem by Simonides commemorating the \r\nSpartan heroes who died defending the hot gates of \r\nThermopylae from invading Persians:\r\n\r\n\r\nPasserby,\r\ntell the Spartans we lie\r\ndead at Thermopylae\r\nmurdered at their word,\r\nobedient to their command.\r\nHave they heard?\r\nDo they understand?\r\nSimonides, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\'re interested in reading more epigrams and epitaphs of the ancients, you \r\ncan click\r\nhere. \r\nIf you prefer to dive into more modern epigrams, or prefer to receive your \r\nmedicine with a dose of humor, please continue reading this \r\npage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSex Ed:\r\nWomen and We Men (Wee Men?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the best epigrams are humorous (and wise) commentary on sex and human \r\nsexual relationships:\r\n\r\nA man\'s got to do what a man\'s got to do. A woman must do what he can\'t.Rhonda Hansome\r\nBehind every successful man is a surprised woman.Maryon Pearson\r\nI\'m not going to vacuum \'til Sears makes one you can ride on.Roseanne \r\nBarr\r\nWhen women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. Men invade another \r\ncountry.Elayne Boosler\r\nWhatever women must do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half \r\nas good.

Warner, Warner Brothers, 1927\r\nI think there is a world market for maybe five \r\ncomputers.Thomas Watson, Chairman of IBM, 1943\r\nComputers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.Popular Mechanics, 1949\r\n640K ought to be enough for anybody.Bill Gates, 1981\r\nI am not a crook!President Richard M. Nixon\r\nRarely is the questioned asked:\r\nIs our children learning?President George W. Bush\r\nYou teach a child to read,\r\nand he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.George W. Bush\r\nYou know, one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on \r\nterror.George W. Bush\r\nOur enemies never stop \r\nthinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.George W. Bush\r\nDeficits don\'t matter.Dick Cheney\r\nWe will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.Dick Cheney, predicting a \r\nquick, easy American victory over Iraq\r\nI can\'t tell you if the use of force in Iraq will last five days, five weeks or five months, but it won\'t last any longer than that.Donald Rumsfeld\r\nOur opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect.Sarah Palin\r\nI don\'t see America having problems.George W. Bush\r\n\r\nThe last two quotes suggest that America\'s worst enemies are politicians \r\nlike Bush and Palin.\r\nYou can find more at \r\nThe Dumbest Things Ever Said and the Worst Predictions of All Time.\r\n\r\nHere are some real head-scratchers from people who recently ran for President of the United States:\r\n\r\nCorporations are people, my friend ... of course they are ... human beings, my friend.Mitt Romney\r\nGive the park police more ammo.Newt \r\nGingrich explaining what to do after a homeless person was \r\nshot in front of the White House\r\n[The] right to privacy ... doesn\'t exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution.Rick Santorum\r\nThe idea is that the state doesn\'t have rights to limit individuals\' wants and passions: I disagree with that.Rick Santorum\r\nOne of the things I will talk about, that no president has talked about before, is ... the dangers of contraception ... It\'s not okay.Rick Santorum\r\nThe state has a right to do that [outlaw contraceptives], I have never questioned that the state has a right to do that.Rick Santorum\r\n\r\nDouglas McArthur\r\nIn these days when ending war is so vitally important, we ought to \r\nconsider the words of one of the world\'s greatest generals, \r\nDouglas McArthur:\r\n\r\nI know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to \r\nme is more revolting. I have long advocated its \r\ncomplete abolition, as its very \r\ndestructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of \r\nsettling international disputes.\r\nIt is my earnest hopeindeed the hope of all mankindthat from this solemn \r\noccasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past, a \r\nworld found upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the \r\ndignity of \r\nman and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for \r\nfreedom, tolerance and \r\njustice.\r\nCould I have but a line a century hence crediting a contribution to the \r\nadvance of peace, I would yield every honor which has been accorded by war.\r\n\r\nThe utter \r\ndestructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative \r\n... If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, Armageddon \r\nwill be at our door.\r\nTalk of imminent threat to our national security through the application of \r\nexternal force is pure nonsense. Our threat is from the insidious forces working \r\nfrom within which have already so drastically altered the character of our free \r\ninstitutionsthose institutions we proudly called the American way of life.\r\nAlways there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign \r\npower that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it.\r\nIt is part of the general pattern of misguided policy that our country is now \r\ngeared to an arms economy which was bred in an artificially induced psychosis of \r\nwar hysteria and nurtured upon an incessant propaganda of fear.\r\nOur government has kept us in a perpetual state of fearkept us in a \r\ncontinuous stampede of patriotic fervorwith the cry of grave \r\nnational \r\nemergency.\r\nThe soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must \r\nsuffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.\r\nThe wisdom of General McArthur agrees with that of the great \r\npeacemakers, humanitarians \r\nand philosophers of the past:\r\n\r\nIn war, truth is the first casualty.Aeschylus\r\nThe clatter of arms drowns out the voice of law.Michel de Montaigne\r\nWe can\'t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.Albert Einstein \r\nI don\'t know about World War III, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Albert Einstein \r\n\r\nMankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.John F. \r\nKennedy\r\n\r\nAnyone who thinks, must think of the next war as they would of suicide.Eleanor Roosevelt\r\n\r\nIf you believe the doctors, nothing is wholesome; if you believe the \r\ntheologians, nothing is innocent; if you believe the military, nothing is safe.Lord Salisbury\r\nWhat difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, \r\nwhether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the \r\nholy name of liberty or democracy?Mohandas Gandhi\r\n\r\nHYPOCRAZY\r\n\r\n\r\nHypocrisy has been called bigoted prejudice with a neon halo, the legacy of \r\nindecency, the lubricant of society, self-righteousness, holy-roller-ism, \r\nfalse sincerity and jealous indignation. Whatever we call it, hypocrisy is \r\nsingularly unattractive, and when powerful nations like the United States \r\npractice it, hypocrisy can also be deadly. For instance, 9-11 was largely the result of the \r\nU.S. government acting unjustly and hypocritically in the Middle East for more than half a \r\ncentury. And yet how many American politicians have been willing to \r\ncandidly discuss the real causes of 9-11? How can we \r\ncorrect incredibly serious problems if we can\'t even see or discuss them \r\nhonestly? Here are epigrams \r\nabout hypocrisy that bear consideration:\r\n\r\nHe does not believe, who does not live according to his belief.Sigmund Freud\r\nHypocrite! First remove the log from your own eye, then you can help remove the speck from your brothers eye.Jesus\r\nA conservative government is an organized hypocrisy.Benjamin Disraeli\r\nHypocrisy, the lie, is the true sister of evil, intolerance and cruelty.Raisa M. Gorbachev\r\nDon`t let the noise of others` opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and \r\nintuition.Steve Jobs\r\nThere\'s nothing like the appearance of virtue to cloak the practice of \r\nvice. \r\nT. Merrill\r\nHypocrisy may deceive the most perceptive adult, but the dullest child \r\nrecognizes and is revolted by it, however ingeniously disguised.Leo Tolstoy, \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEleanor Roosevelt\r\n\r\nEleanor Roosevelt was perhaps the most \r\ninfluential first lady in American history. After FDR\'s death, she was a delegate to the UN General Assembly from 1945 and 1952, a job for which she was appointed \r\nby President Harry S. Truman and confirmed by the United States Senate. During her time at the UN she chaired the committee that \r\ndrafted and approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. President Truman called her the First Lady of the World in tribute \r\nto her human rights achievements. Her wit and wisdom shine through in the following \r\nepigrams:\r\n\r\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\r\nDo what you feel in your heart to be right, for you\'ll be criticized anyway. \r\nYou\'ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don\'t.\r\nI can not believe that war is the best solution. No one won the last war, and \r\nno one will win the next war.\r\nIt is not more vacation we needit is more vocation.\r\nIt isn\'t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn\'t enough to believe in it. One must work at it.\r\nJustice cannot be for one side alone, but must be for both.\r\nNever allow a person to tell you no who doesn\'t have the power to say yes.\r\nWhen will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human misery rather than avenge it?\r\n\r\nModern Epigrams: Email Sign-Offs, Tweets, Personal Mottos, Slogans, etc.\r\n\r\na Tweet\r\nby any other name\r\nwould be as fleet!\r\n@mikerburch\r\n\r\nDiscontent is the first necessity of progress.Thomas Alva Edison\r\n\r\nThe Edison epigram above has become my personal motto. I\'ve used it \r\nto sign off many an email and I\'ve received\r\na number of emails that \r\nend with epigrams. In fact, I first discovered two wonderfully touching epigrams by \r\nMichel de Montaigne and Ana\xefs Nin (below on this page) in emails sent to me by colleagues. \r\nA popular new form of epigram is the Tweet. Here\'s my \r\nfavorite Tweet to date:\r\nThe Capitol looks beautiful and I am honored to be at work tonight.Gabrielle Giffords\r\nGabrielle Giffords is the Arizona congresswoman who was shot by a \r\ngun-wielding serial killer. Reading her \r\nhighly poetic \r\nTweet, I can actually see our nation\'s Capitol lit up at night, shining \r\nlike a beacon, and I can feel her sincerity. \r\nAs I write this, \r\nI am reminded of Gabby\'s favorite epigram, which appears on her Facebook page:\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as \r\nGod gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to \r\nbind up the nation\'s wounds.Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\nTo further demonstrate how epigrams can intersect our lives and perhaps influence our \r\nstars, Gabby\'s husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, had inscribed on her\r\nwedding ring, You\'re the closest to heaven that \r\nI\'ve ever beenwords from a song by the Goo Goo Dolls that obviously have \r\na very special meaning for them. The inscription is actually a short rhyming \r\npoem, an epigram for the ages:\r\n\r\nYou\'re the closest to heaven\r\nthat I\'ve ever been.\r\n\r\nEpigrams in Unexpected Places\r\n\r\nAs I worked on this page, I was struck by the sweetness, tenderness, honesty and \r\nwisdom of one of the world\'s most famous dumb blondes. As a famous epigram \r\nsuggests, perhaps we shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover. Please consider the \r\nwit and wisdom of Marilyn Monroe ...\r\n\r\nMarilyn Monroe\r\n\r\nWhat do I wear in bed? Why, Chanel No. 5, of course!\r\nIt\'s not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on.\r\nSex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.\r\nI\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.\r\nIf I\'d observed all the rules I\'d never have gotten anywhere.\r\nI love to do the things the censors won\'t pass.\r\nIf you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything.\r\nA wise girl kisses but doesn\'t love, listens but doesn\'t believe, and leaves \r\nbefore she is left.\r\nIf you can\'t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don\'t deserve me at \r\nmy best.\r\nI don\'t mind making jokes, but I don\'t want to look like one.\r\nI have too many fantasies to be a housewife. I guess I am a fantasy.\r\n\r\nThere was my name up in lights. I said, God, somebody\'s made a mistake. But \r\nthere it was, in lights. And I sat there and said, Remember, you\'re not a \r\nstar. Yet there it was, up in lights.\r\n\r\nPuns, Word-Play, Raillery and Drollery\r\n\r\nA pun is a form of word-play. Raillery has been \r\ndefined as "light, teasing banter," "gentle mockery" and \r\n"good-humored satire or ridicule." Drollery is something whimsically comical. \r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nThere is no glory in outstripping donkeys.Marcus Valerius Martial\r\nAs blushing may make a whore seem virtuous, so modesty may make a fool seem sensible.Jonathan Swift\r\nReligion is the opiate of the people.Karl Marx\r\nReligion is the dopiate of the sheeple.Michael R. Burch\r\nIn three words, I can sum up everything I\'ve learned about life: It goes on.Robert \r\nFrost\r\nIn six words, I can sum up everything I\'ve learned about life: It goes on, until \r\nit doesn\'t.Michael R. Burch\r\nIf you think you\'re too small to make an impact, try going to bed with a mosquito.Edith Sitwell\r\nIf we dont want to define ourselves by things as superficial as our appearances, were stuck with the revolting alternative of \r\nbeing judged by our actions.Ellen DeGeneres\r\n\r\nHere\'s a bit of rather gentle raillery of my own, called Saving Graces, that I \r\nhave dedicated to the Moral Majority or Religious Right:\r\n\r\nLifes saving graces are love, pleasure, laughter ...\r\nwisdom, it seems, is for the Hereafter.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy epigram is dedicated to Christians who claim they\'ll inherit heaven at the \r\nexpense of everyone else. If you question the idea that Einstein and Gandhi will go to hell, please read\r\nWhy hell is vanishing from the \r\nBible.\r\n\r\nWaggery, Jests, Ribald Jokes\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum from raillery would be waggery (the wisecrack, the bald-faced jest, the ribald joke which is \r\nsexual, excretory or somehow offensive, to someone):\r\n\r\nA man who says he can see through a woman is missing a lot.Groucho Marx \r\nA man\'s only as old as the woman he feels.Groucho Marx\r\n\r\nThe One-Liner, or Zinger\r\n\r\nAnother name for Marx\'s method is "the zinger," a potent form of the comedian\'s \r\none-liner. The zinger requires \r\nupsetting the applecart of our polite polities. But there are many other \r\n"flavors" of epigrams. One of my favorite categories is best exemplified by the \r\nDivine Oscar Wilde, who upsets the applecart in an entirely different way:\r\n\r\nQuestions are never indiscreet, answers sometimes are.Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nThe Bon Mot\r\n\r\nWhat a wickedly scathing line! This is a wonderful example of the bon mot \r\n("good word"), the best way of saying something. There has never been a better \r\ncritic of gossip, innuendo and scandal-mongering than Oscar Wilde (perhaps \r\nbecause so many prudes, busybodies and gossips considered him to be scandalous, \r\nwhen the real scandal was that they refused to mind their own business):\r\n\r\nScandal is gossip made tedious by morality.Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nWilde is every moralist\'s worst nightmare, because he was wise in the ways of \r\nthe world and human nature, whilemoralists are usually up to their \r\neyeballs in hypocrisy. Centuries before Wilde, Aristotle proved the ancient Greeks \r\ncould be just as scathing:\r\n\r\nWit is educated insolence.Aristotle\r\n\r\nBut epigrams can also be wonderfully touching and moving:\r\n\r\nThe births of all things are weak and tender,\r\ntherefore we should have our eyes intent on beginnings.\r\n\r\nMichel de Montaigne\r\n\r\nIf we are to have real peace in the world,\r\nwe shall have to begin with the children.\r\n\r\nMohandas Gandhi\r\n\r\nAs an Israeli, I have come to understand:\r\nthere is no way to love Israel and reject a two-state peace,\r\nno way to love Israel and reject Palestine.\r\n\r\nYael Dayan, daughter of Moshe Dayan, Israel\'s most famous general\r\n\r\nIf you would lift me you must be on higher ground.Ralph \r\nWaldo Emerson\r\n\r\n\r\nEpigrams can also be wise, and liberating:\r\n\r\nIt takes courage to push yourself to places that you have never been before, to \r\ntest your limits, to break through barriers. And the day came when the risk it \r\ntook to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to \r\nblossom.Ana\xefs Nin\r\n\r\nShake off all fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for \r\nevery fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a god; \r\nbecause if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that \r\nof blindfolded fear.Thomas Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rank is but the guineas stamp; the mans the gowd [gold] for a \r\n[all] that!Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\nEpigrams like the last one above helped fuel the \r\nAmerican and French revolutions; Burns was saying that commoners had the same \r\nmettle and worth as royals and lords. Here\'s a similar epigram by \r\nanother great poet:\r\n\r\nI am his Highness\' dog at Kew;\r\npray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\r\nAlexander Pope\r\n\r\nDouble Entendres\r\n\r\nAnother category of the epigram is the double entendre, in which two \r\nmeanings of a word or phrase are exploited simultaneously:\r\n\r\nWhen women go wrong, men go right after them.Mae West\r\nGive a man a free hand and he\'ll run it all over you.Mae West\r\nMarriage is a great institution, but I\'m not ready to be institutionalized..Mae West\r\n\r\nAphorisms\r\n\r\nEpigrams which convey essential truths \r\nor principles are called aphorisms:\r\n\r\nA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.Unknown\r\nA watched pot never boils.Unknown\r\nLife is short, art long.Hippocrates\r\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little \r\nstatesmen and philosophers and divines.Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\nThe epigram is the simple, elegant black dress of literature; it leaves nearly everything \r\nbared and yet still temptingly open to the imagination. The best \r\nepigrammatists produce belle lettres ("beautiful letters" or "fine \r\nwriting") en brief (in brief). But there is as much diversity among epigrammatists as there is in the sea. Take \r\nthe \r\none below from the master of relativity himself, Albert Einstein. Einstein, who was \r\nquite the ladies\' man, was asked to explain relativity. He chose to describe the \r\nperception of time as an aspect of \r\nhuman nature and physical attraction:\r\n\r\nSit next to a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. Sit on a red-hot \r\nstove for a minute, it seems like an hour. That\'s relativity!Albert Einstein\r\n\r\nThe Limerick\r\n\r\nAnother popular form of the epigram is the limerick. Here\'s one that delves into the \r\nzanier aspects of relativity:\r\n\r\nThere once was a woman named Bright\r\nwho traveled much faster than light.\r\nShe set out one day\r\nin a relative way\r\nand came back the previous night!\r\n\r\nLeg-Pulling, Horseplay, Whimsy, Monkeyshines, etc. \r\n\r\nEinstein\'s epigram might be assigned any of a number of sub-terms: leg-pulling, \r\nhorseplay, whimsy, a monkeyshine ... perhaps even a\r\nhoodwink, boondoggle or snow job (since the "relativity" being discussed \r\nhas little to do with physics, but much to do with physiques, body \r\nchemistry and sex). Still, Einstein\'s epigram, whatever we choose to call it, contains considerable \r\nwisdom. But sometimes epigrams can be entirely for amusement, such as this \r\none of mine:\r\n\r\nNun Fun Undone\r\n\r\nAbbesses\'\r\nrecesses\r\nare not for excesses!\r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn epigram like mine that is entirely for the sake of humor might earn sobriquets like:\r\ntomfoolery, buffoonery, mummery, a chestnut, a gag, a ha-ha, a jape, a jest, a \r\nlark, a rib, a sally, a quirk, a whim, a vagary.\r\n\r\nQuips\r\n\r\nA similar form of epigram is the comic\'s one-liner, or quip. One of the most famous \r\none-liners is:\r\n\r\nTake my wife ... please!Henny Youngman, later borrowed by Rodney \r\nDangerfield\r\n\r\nThe Chiasmus\r\n\r\nThe chiasmus repeats \r\nthe same or very similar words in a different order:\r\n\r\nIt\'s not the size of the dog in the fight that counts, it\'s the size of the \r\nfight in the dog.Dwight D. Eisenhower\r\nIt\'s not the men in your life that count, it\'s the life in your men.Mae West\r\nLife is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.Maya Angelou \r\n\r\nHumility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less.C. \r\nS. Lewis\r\nLove is either wholly folly, \r\nor fully holy.Michael R. Burch\r\nI do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. \r\nI do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.Ronald \r\nReagan\r\nWar does not determine who is right, just who is left.Unknown, associated by fans with the Dan Fogelberg song Ghosts\r\n\r\nSpoonerisms\r\n\r\nOne of the more creative types of epigram is the spoonerism:\r\n\r\nI\'d rather have a bottle in front of me\r\nthan a frontal lobotomy.\r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nAbsinthe makes the tart grow fonder.Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n\r\nIn effect, a spoonerism is an aural chiasmus: the sounds of words are reversed, rather \r\nthan the same or similar words being reversed.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes\r\n\r\nAnother category of epigram is the anecdote, a brief account or narrative, often \r\nto make or stress an important point:\r\n\r\nI came, I saw, I conquered.Julius Caesar \r\nI have not come to praise Caesar, but to bury him.Brutus\r\nEt tu, Brut\xe9?Julius Caesar [You too, Brutus?]\r\n\r\nEpitaphs\r\n\r\nThen there are "dead serious" epigrams, called epitaphs. These are the inscriptions that appear on headstones. Here\'s one of mine called "Epitaph for a \r\nPalestinian Child":\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSometimes the lines blur. Here\'s an epitaph that is also a chiasmus, from \r\nthe headstone of the famous boxer Jack Dempsey:\r\n\r\nA gentle man and a gentleman.Unknown\r\n\r\nEpithets\r\n\r\nThe epigram above is also an example of encomium (praise or eulogy). The \r\nopposite type of epigram, when offered as invective, is the epithet.\r\nAn epithet defines or characterizes someone or something. In \r\nHomer\'s day epithets were often complimentary. But today epithets are \r\nusually non-complimentary, if not downright offensive. Modern \r\nepithets often \r\ndescend into derogatory slang and racial invective. But in the hands of a master \r\nepigrammatist like Will Rogers, they can still be sublime in effect:\r\n\r\nAn economist\'s guess is liable to be as good as anybody else\'s.Will Rogers\r\nMake crime pay. Become a lawyer.Will Rogers\r\nA fool and his money are soon elected.Will Rogers\r\n\r\nPolitical Epigrams\r\n\r\nPolitical epigrams can be equally scathing, whether aimed at liberals, conservatives or politicians in general:\r\n\r\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.John F. Kennedy\r\nThe very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.John F. Kennedy\r\nI believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.John \r\nF. Kennedy\r\nPoliticians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason.Mark Twain\r\nPatriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.Mark Twain\r\nMy choices in life were to be a piano-player in a whorehouse or a politician. \r\nAnd to tell the truth, there\'s hardly any difference!Harry S. Truman\r\nIt\'s a recession when your neighbor loses his job; it\'s a depression when you lose yours.Harry \r\nS. Truman\r\nGreat spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.Albert Einstein\r\n\r\nTo read more please click here:\r\nThe Best \r\nPolitical Poems and Epigrams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEthnic Humor\r\n\r\nA sub-genre of the epithet consists of racial, ethnic or cultural ribbing. Southerners \r\noften poke fun at themselves and their neighbors with "hillbilly humor":\r\n\r\nYou might be a redneck if your family tree don\'t fork.Unknown\r\nYou might be a redneck if your cars sit on blocks and your house has wheels.Unknown\r\nYou might be a redneck if you think loading the dishwasher means getting your \r\nwife drunk.Jeff Foxworthy \r\n\r\nParody and Lampooning\r\n\r\nAnother genre of epigrams engages in \r\nparody and lampooning. Here\'s one I hope to someday include it in a book of \r\npoems to be titled Why I Left the Religious Right:\r\n\r\nI\'ve got Jesus\'s name on a wallet insert\r\nand Hell is for Queers on the back of my shirt\r\nand I uphold the Law,\r\nfor grace has a flaw:\r\nthe Church must have someone to drag through the dirt!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nProverbs and Wisdom Sayings\r\n\r\nYet another type of epigram  \r\nhas any number of names. Let\'s begin with "proverb" and a famous illustration by one \r\nof the world\'s best-known epigrammatists:\r\n\r\nEarly to bed, early to rise\r\nmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\r\nBen Franklin\r\n\r\nMiguel de Cervantes defined a proverb as a short sentence based on long \r\nexperience.\r\nThere are, it seems, a bazillion other names for such bits of homey wisdom: adage, \r\nmoral, homily, bromide, aphorism, apophthegm, axiom, dictum, maxim, motto, folk wisdom, \r\nplatitude, motto, precept, saw, saying, truism, catchphrase, formula,  \r\ngnome, pithy saying, etc. \r\n\r\nSometimes the epigram is the salvo \r\na battle-savvy cynic launches against human ignorance, \r\nintolerance, cruelty and insanity:\r\n\r\nThere are many humorous things in the world; among them, the white man\'s notion that he is less savage than the other savages.Mark \r\nTwain\r\n\r\nTo determine the truth of Twain\'s remark, just inquire with any black American \r\nslave, or any Native American who walked the Trail of Tears, or any Palestinian \r\nwho\'s been herded inside the walled ghetto of Gaza and had the gates slammed \r\nshut in his face. None of them will praise the white man\'s self-avowed \r\ndemocratic ideals or his Judeo-Christian ethics. Here are more words from \r\nthe wise:\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what weapons will be used in World War III, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Albert \r\nEinstein\r\n\r\nMankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.John F. \r\nKennedy\r\n\r\nAnyone who thinks must think of the next war as they would of suicide.Eleanor Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of such epigrams goes way back in time. In the 6th century B.C. the \r\nlegendarily rich King Croesus of Lydia said:\r\n\r\nIn peace sons bury their fathers, but in war fathers bury their sons.Croesus\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the expensive, bloody follies of the U.S. government in the \r\nMiddle East, we can only wish American politicians had heeded Will Rogers:\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that we do worse than any other \r\nnation, it is try and manage somebody else\'s affairs.\r\nWill Rogers\r\n\r\nAnd a great French essayist can explain why American freedoms seem to be \r\nvanishing:\r\n\r\nThe clatter of arms drowns out the voice of law.Michel de Montaigne\r\n\r\nFollowing in the same vein of questioning whether human beings are using their \r\nadvanced brains to think when they do such things as wage war, here are two related epigrams by one of my favorite contemporary writers:\r\n\r\nThinking is often claimed but seldom proven. \r\nT. Merrill\r\nIt must be hard being brilliant with no way to prove it. \r\nT. Merrill\r\n\r\n\r\nProtests\r\n\r\nThe great epigrammatists often arise from the ranks of the disaffected and oppressed. Oscar \r\nWilde, the greatest epigrammatist of them all, served time in Reading Gaol for \r\n"indecency" (he had the temerity to be flamboyantly gay). Twain wrote volumes \r\nexposing and expounding on the massive illogic of orthodox Christianity (he had \r\nthe temerity to be a heretic, but had to hold up the publication of his \r\nanti-Christian opus Letters from the Earth for fifty years after his \r\ndeath, in order to protect his family from fire-breathing Christian \r\nfundamentalists). Einstein \r\nproduced \r\nmany of his epigrams against the backdrop of Nazi Germany (he had the temerity to \r\nbe a brilliant Jew). Today many of our best epigrammatists are women who \r\ncombine sharp minds with even sharper tongues:\r\n\r\nA male gynecologist is like an auto mechanic who never owned a car.Carrie Snow\r\nThe phrase "working mother" is redundant.Jane Sellman\r\nIf high heels were so wonderful, men would still be wearing them.Sue \r\nGrafton\r\nIf you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, \r\nask a woman.Margaret Thatcher\r\n\r\nHere\'s a similar epigram that I absolutely love, although it creates something of a \r\ndichotomy:\r\n\r\nWhen women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. Men invade another \r\ncountry.Elayne Boosler\r\n\r\nFemale politicians like Margaret Thatcher may be somewhat at odds (or loose \r\nends) with female comedians like Elayne Boosler, since Thatcher wasn\'t above an \r\ninvasion herself (of the Falkland Islands). But Boosler hammers the human funnybone \r\nnonetheless. She doesn\'t have to be perfect, just witty and succinct enough to \r\nmake us blink, then think.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous epigrams above prove women\'s brains are every bit as good as \r\nmen\'s, as they extract Eve\'s revenge at the expense of men\'s prehistoric \r\nprejudices. Here\'s my favorite epigram in this genre: \r\n\r\nWhatever women must do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half \r\nas good. Luckily, this is not difficult.Charlotte Whitton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA great female epigrammatist can use her razor-sharp wit to deflate bigotry:\r\n\r\nI\'m not offended by dumb blonde jokes because I\'m not dumb, \r\nand also I\'m not blonde.Dolly Parton\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever made a better case for the combinatory advantages of brains, \r\nwigs and peroxide? (I will refrain from mentioning Dolly\'s other, even more \r\nglamorous advantages.)\r\n\r\nParadox\r\n\r\nSocrates suggested that we define our terms, so for my purposes here I will use \r\nthe primary term epigram and define it with Webster as a terse, sage or witty \r\nand often paradoxical saying. Paradox can be both enlightening and amusing. \r\nHere\'s a stellar example by a contemporary writer:\r\n\r\n\r\nNowadays we make quick work of our courtships; it\'s our divorces that we spend a lot of time on.Richard Moore \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParadoxical, indeed! But some epigrams are so paradoxical they seem to be \r\nbest taken for purposes of amusement and bemusement only:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can observe a lot just by watching.Yogi Berra\r\nThere are some people who, if they don\'t already know, you \r\ncan\'t tell \'em.Yogi Berra\r\nNobody goes there anymore; it\'s too crowded.Yogi Berra\r\nI know you heard what you thought I said, but what I said isnt what I meant.Richard \r\nNixon\r\nMore and more of our imports come from overseas.President George W. Bush\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n\r\nTo give us the most possible good material to work with, I will construe the term "epigram" to include one-liners, zingers, spoonerisms, \r\nwitticisms, aphorisms, saws, pithy sayings, epitaphs, epithets, proverbs, \r\ndoggerel, the chiasmus (I decline to use the strange plural: chiasmi), brief \r\nquotes, short poems, hillbilly humor, maxims, truisms, the wisdom of the ages, etc. I \r\nwill take as my motto and my guiding light:\r\n\r\nBrevity is the soul of wit.William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nOne takes one\'s literary life into one\'s own hands when one attempts to go beyond \r\nthe Masters, but then again "nothing ventured, nothing gained" (an \r\nepigram and a perfectly good truism), so please allow me to suggest that:\r\n\r\nIf brevity is the soul of wit\r\nthen brevity and levity\r\nare the whole of it.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBut then a good epigrammatist won\'t let us wriggle easily off the hook of a \r\nquick assumption:\r\n\r\nBrevity is the soul of lingerie.Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nThe great epigrammatists will invariably do one of two things: they will either \r\namuse and bemuse us into wisdom, or they will scathe us into wisdom. Here are \r\nsome wonderful examples of the former:\r\n\r\n\r\nA hangover is the wrath of grapes.Unknown\r\n\r\nTo be safe on the Fourth,\r\nDon\'t buy a fifth on the third.\r\nJames H Muehlbauer\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epigrams above certainly amuse and bemuse, and while most people are \r\nunlikely to heed them, they point out the perils of \r\ndrinking too much: the loss of brain cells, hangovers,  \r\nfireworks that explode in our hands, etc. Other \r\nepigrams may be less overtly funny, but  \r\nstill entertaining and enlightening:\r\n\r\nI can resist everything except temptation.Oscar Wilde\r\nThe only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.Oscar Wilde\r\nThose who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained.William \r\nBlake\r\n\r\nThere is a charm about the forbidden that makes it unspeakably desirable.Mark \r\nTwain\r\n\r\nTo forbid us anything is to make us have a mind for it.Michel de \r\nMontaigne\r\nNothing so needs reforming as other peoples habits.Mark \r\nTwain\r\nLoyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.Mark \r\nTwain\r\nMust I do all the evil I can before I learn to shun it? Is it not enough to know \r\nthe evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love \r\nevil too well to give it up.Mohandas Gandhi\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat some of the world\'s greatest writers and wits seem to be telling \r\nus, if I apprehend them correctly, is that orthodox morality is dubious at best, \r\nif it is morality at all. \r\nThe great wits listen to sermons about sex being a "sin" and roll their eyeballs \r\ntoward the heavens, then \r\nwrite scathing epigrams as a way of possibly curing man of his folly. They know the \r\npreacher who lectures his flock on the "evils" of sex is just as randy as \r\nthe rest of them, and probably less inhibited (unless he\'s a septuagenarian \r\nand his hormones have "petered" out, pun intended). Wilde, Blake and Twain understood human \r\nnature and were honest about \r\nit, and themselves. Twain pointed out that any red-blooded man \r\nwould give up any possible shot at heaven for a few blissful seconds with the \r\nEve of his dreams. \r\nAnyone who claims the Holy Spirit cures human beings of sexual desire is \r\nobviously wrong, because human sexuality is not a disease.\r\nBut I digress. To continue ... on these pages you will find some of the \r\nwittiest, funniest, pithiest and scathingest things human beings have said, to \r\nthis late date, on our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy favorite epigrammatists are Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain. Other famous wits sampled herein include Aristotle, Ambrose Bierce, Martial, Ogden Nash \r\nand Plato, just to drop a few good names. You won\'t find \r\nmany platitudes like "neither a borrower nor a lender be" because my \r\npreference is for wince-and-wisdom-inducing humor. After all, Shakespeare was \r\nundoubtedly poking fun at \r\nPolonius, the banal moralist, whose own children were basket cases. T. S. Eliot \r\n"got \r\nit," as evidenced by his Prufrock. Most readers don\'t. He who has ears to hear, let \r\nhim hear.\r\n\r\nRepartee and Rejoinders\r\n\r\nOne of my all-time favorite epigrams consists of this exchange of repartee between \r\nWinston Churchill and Lady Astor:\r\n\r\nLady Astor: "Winston, you\'re \r\ndrunk!"\r\nWinston Churchill: "But I shall be sober in the morning and you, madam, will \r\nstill be ugly."\r\nLady Astor: "Mr. Churchill, if you were my husband, I\'d put poison in your tea."\r\nWinston Churchill: "Madam, if I were your husband, I\'d drink it."\r\n\r\nOne Good Epigram Deserves Another\r\n\r\nGod doesn\'t play dice with the Universe.Albert Einstein\r\nNo, but he sure plays a mean game of hide-and-seek!Woody Allen\r\n\r\nMotivational Calls to Action\r\n\r\nBut a good epigram can also be a call to action:\r\n\r\nDiscontent is the first necessity of progress.Thomas Alva Edison\r\n\r\nAn epigram can also be a call to compassion, empathy and kindness:\r\n\r\nAlways be kinder than necessary,\r\nfor everyone you meet is fighting\r\nsome kind of battle.\r\nattributed to T.H. Thompson and John Watson\r\n\r\nDon\'t judge a man until you\'ve walked a mile in his moccasins.Native \r\nAmerican proverb\r\n\r\nThe Method Behind the Madness\r\n\r\nRobert Frost, probably America\'s last major poet, said "poetry begins in delight \r\nand ends in wisdom." I would like to paraphrase him, if I may, and say:\r\n\r\nEpigrams delight us into wisdom.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn brief, the epigram is the Harry Houdini of literature. Here are a few \r\nmore of my all-time favorite epigrams:\r\n\r\nI can\'t live without you or with you.Ovid\r\nTake it from me, marriage isn\'t a word, it\'s a sentence!Vidor \r\nKing\r\nOur existence is a short circuit of light between two eternities of darkness.Vladimir Nabokov\r\nThe secret of getting things done is to act!Dante Alighieri\r\nToto, Ive got a feeling were not in Kansas anymore!Dorothy (played \r\nby Judy \r\nGarland)\r\nHouston, we have a problem.Jim Lovell\r\nBefore Elvis, there was nothing.John Lennon\r\nLife is what happens to you while you\'re busy making other plans.John Lennon\r\n\r\nEpigrams in Popular Music: Rock, Country, Folk, Soul, RB, Hip-Hop, Rap, \r\netc.\r\n\r\nImagine theres no heaven; its easy if you try; no hell below us; above us, only sky.John \r\nLennon\r\nA change is gonna come.Sam Cooke\r\nWar is not the answer, because only love can conquer hate.Marvin \r\nGaye\r\nLove is a battlefield.Pat Benatar\r\nI\'m so lonesome, I could cry.Hank Williams Sr.\r\nOnly the good die young.Billy Joel\r\nI am a rock; I am an island.Paul Simon\r\nI ain\'t no fortunate one.John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater \r\nRevival\r\nIt\'s better to burn out, than fade away.Neil \r\nYoung\r\nWho wants to live forever?Freddy Mercury of Queen\r\nThis world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.Don \r\nMcLean\r\nAnd though you want to last forever, you know you never will, and the \r\ngood-bye makes the journey harder still.Cat Stevens\r\nThe answer is blowin\' in the wind.Bob Dylan\r\nFreedoms just another word for nothing left to lose.Kris \r\nKristofferson/Janis Joplin\r\nMy mama ain\'t raise no fool because my mama ain\'t raise me, fool!Sean \r\nPrice\r\nBaby, we were born to run.Bruce Springsteen\r\nBecause you\'re mine, I walk the line.Johnny Cash\r\n\r\nI love you in a place where \r\nthere\'s no space or time;\r\nI love you for my life, \'cause you\'re a friend of mine.\r\nLeon Russell\r\n\r\nThere is a crack in everything, that\'s how the light gets in.Leonard \r\nCohen\r\nChildren show scars like medals. Lovers use them as secrets to reveal. A scar is \r\nwhat happens when the word is made flesh.Leonard \r\nCohen\r\nPoetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is \r\njust the ash.Leonard Cohen\r\nI don\'t consider myself a pessimist at all. I think of a pessimist as someone \r\nwho is waiting for it to rain. And I feel completely soaked to the skin.Leonard \r\nCohen\r\n\r\n\r\nAn\r\nEpigram about Epigrams, giving Honor where Honor is Due\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, with the literate, I am\r\nImpelled to try an epigram,\r\nI never seek to take the credit;\r\nWe all assume that Oscar said it.\r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nDorothy Parker is both succinct and correct: If I hear a really good epigram \r\nand can\'t immediately identify its source, my first guess will almost invariably \r\nbe the Divine Oscar Wilde. So without further ado, let\'s kick off this show by \r\nsurrendering the stage to the greatest epigrammatist of them all ...\r\n\r\nThe Oscar Goes to Wilde: Epigrams by the Divine\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde\r\n\r\nWilde Advice on Vice:\r\n\r\nOne should always play fairly, \r\nwhen one has the winning cards.\r\nThe only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. It is never any use to \r\noneself.\r\nSelfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as \r\none wishes them to live.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing Wilde on God, Religion and Morality:\r\n\r\nI believe God in creating Man somewhat overestimated his ability.\r\nMorality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike.\r\nSelf-denial is the shining sore on the leprous body of Christianity.\r\nAlways forgive your enemies: nothing annoys them so much.\r\nThere is no sin except stupidity.\r\nEvery saint has a past and every sinner has a future.\r\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\r\n\r\nGoing Wilde on Fashion, Fads, Fame, Society, Culture and the Arts:\r\n\r\nThe public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.\r\nThe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\r\nFashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable we are compelled to alter it every six months.\r\nAmerica is the only country that went from barbarism to decencies without civilization in between.\r\nWork is the curse of the drinking classes.\r\nDo not speak ill of society ... only people who can\'t get in do that.\r\nIt is a much cleverer thing to talk nonsense than to listen to it.\r\nArguments are extremely vulgar, for everyone in good society holds exactly the same opinion.\r\n\r\nGoing Wilde on Love, Relationships, Women and Men:\r\n\r\nWoman begins by resisting a man\'s advances and ends by blocking his retreat.\r\nWomen are made to be loved, not understood.\r\nA man\'s face is his autobiography. A woman\'s face is her work of fiction.\r\nHow marriage ruins a man! It is as demoralizing as cigarettes, and far more expensive.\r\nMen always want to be a woman\'s first love; women like to be a man\'s last romance.\r\nBigamy is having one wife too many. Monogamy is the same.\r\n\r\nGoing Wilde on Time, Aging and Human Nature:\r\n\r\nTo live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\r\nBe yourself; everyone else is already taken.\r\nThe old believe everything, the middle-aged suspect everything, the young know everything.\r\nA cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\r\nTo get back my youth I would do anything  except exercise, get up early, or be respectable.\r\n\r\nWilde Truths:\r\n\r\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple.\r\nAn idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.\r\nA thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.\r\n\r\nWilde on Oscar:\r\n\r\nI have nothing to declare except my genius. [To a customs officer.]\r\nI have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.\r\nWhenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.\r\nI am so clever that sometimes I don\'t understand a single word of what I am \r\nsaying.\r\nI never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read.\r\nWhy was I born with such contemporaries?\r\n\r\nWilde Last Words:\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to die beyond my means. [Upon learning he needed an operation.]\r\n\r\nEither that wallpaper goes, or I do. [His final words.]\r\n\r\nTo read more Oscar Wilde epigrams please click here:\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde Quips, Quotes and Epigrams\r\n\r\nIf every witty thing thats said were true,\r\nOscar Wilde, the world would worship You!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Twain Well Met: Epigrams by \r\nMark \r\nTwain\r\n\r\nTwain on God, Religion, Morality, Death, Heaven and Hell:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s not the parts of the Bible that I don\'t understand that bother me, it\'s the parts I do understand.\r\nI found out that I was a Christian for revenue only and I could not bear the \r\nthought of that, it was so ignoble.\r\nTo be good is noble; but to show others how to be good is nobler and less trouble.\r\nNothing so needs reforming as other peoples habits.\r\nAlways do right. That will gratify some of the people, and astonish the rest.\r\n\r\nI don\'t like to commit myself about heaven and hell; I have friends in both places.\r\nGo to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company.\r\nLoyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.\r\n\r\nThe Christian\'s Bible is a drug store. Its contents remain the same, but the medical practice changes.\r\n\r\nTwain on Truth and Veracity:\r\n\r\nDenial ain\'t just a river in Egypt.\r\nTruth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it.\r\nTruth is mighty and will prevail. There is nothing wrong with this, except that it ain\'t so.\r\nIt ain\'t what you don\'t know that gets you into trouble. It\'s what you do know that ain\'t so.\r\n\r\nTwain on Money:\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples have no real force except when one is well-fed.\r\nPut all your eggs in one basket, then: watch the basket!\r\n\r\nTwain on Wit, Literature and the Arts:\r\n\r\nA classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to \r\nread.\r\nThe very ink with which history is written is merely fluid prejudice.\r\nIt\'s no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.\r\nThe man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.\r\n\r\nTwain on Men, Women and Marriage:\r\n\r\nFamiliarity breeds contempt, and children.\r\nWhat would men be without women? Scarce, sir, mighty scarce.\r\n\r\nTwain on Politics:\r\n\r\nPatriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.\r\nPoliticians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason.\r\nWhat is the difference between a taxidermist and a tax collector? The taxidermist takes only your skin.\r\nIn our country we have three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice either of them.\r\n\r\nTwain on Youth, Health and the Dubious Joys of Aging:\r\n\r\nAge is an issue of mind over matter. If you don\'t mind, it doesn\'t matter.\r\nI have never taken any exercise except sleeping and resting.\r\nGiving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I\'ve done it thousands of times.\r\n\r\nTwain on Animals:\r\n\r\nMan is the only animal that blushes.

Sorrows bring forth.\r\nThe busy bee has no time for sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elegant Epigrams and Side-Splitting Spoonerisms of Dorothy \r\nParker\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'d rather have a bottle in front of me\r\nthan a frontal lobotomy.\r\n\r\nMen seldom make passes\r\nAt girls who wear glasses.\r\n\r\nBrevity is the soul of lingerie.\r\nA little bad taste is like a nice dash of paprika.\r\nThey sicken of the calm, who knew the storm.\r\nIf all the girls who attended the Yale prom were laid end to \r\nend, I wouldn\'t be a bit surprised.\r\nThe only \'ism\' Hollywood believes in is plagiarism.\r\nIf you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it \r\nto.\r\nI\'ve never been a millionaire but I just know I\'d be darling \r\nat it.\r\nTake care of the luxuries and the necessities will take care \r\nof themselves.\r\nThis is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly.

We have guided missiles and misguided men.\r\nThe past is prophetic in that it asserts loudly that wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.\r\nWe will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence of the good people.\r\nEvery man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.\r\nHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. \r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say we must not wage war.
