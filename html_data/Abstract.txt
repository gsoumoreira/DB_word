Which are \r\nthe best abstract poems of all time? \r\n\r\nBefore we attempt to answer such questions, Socrates would advise us to \r\ndefine what we mean by abstract poetry. And the subject can quickly \r\nbecome confusing because there are multiple definitions that\r\nmay be applied. I am \r\ngoing to include poems in three different categories:\r\n\r\n(1) Edith Sitwell coined the term abstract poetry to describe poemsin which \r\nwords are chosen for their aural quality (i.e., sound) rather than primarily \r\nfor their sense or meaning. Poets who sometimes seem to favor sound over \r\nsense \r\ninclude Sitwell, e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, Gerard Manley Hopkins, \r\nDylan Thomas, Algernon Charles Swinburne, humorists like Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, and the penners of \r\nvarious limericks and nursery rhymes. An example of aural abstraction can be \r\nfound in this snippet from my translation of the ancient Anglo-Saxon poem Wulf \r\nand Eadwacer:\r\n\r\nTo my people he\'s prey, a pariah.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nUngelc is s!\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhile most readers won\'t know what the third line means, they can probably sense \r\nthe female speaker\'s emotional anguish. The meaning is something like: We are \r\nso unalike, so different! Her lover Wulf is being pursued by men who act like a \r\npack of wild dogs. She is not like them and is horrified by their behavior. \r\n\r\n(2) Ever since William Carlos Williams coined the phrase no ideas but in things \r\nsome poets have insisted that concrete imagery and metaphors \r\nbased on such imagery are the foundation of poetry, if not its be-all and \r\nend-all. Arguing against this idea, one can point out magnificent poetry that \r\ndoesn\'t rely on images or metaphors to get its main points across. For example, any number of \r\nShakespearean soliloquies, much of Paradise Lost by John Milton, and the \r\nbest direct \r\nstatement poems of A. E. Housman. In such poetry the authors tell rather than \r\nshow. While there\'s nothing wrong with showing rather than telling, \r\nthere\'s no reason to believe Shakespeare can\'t tell us what he wants us to \r\nknow through the direct statements of his \r\ncharacters, since he did just that so splendidly! The female speaker of Wulf and \r\nEadwacer just flat-out tells us what has happened to her beloved Wulf:\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, surrounded by fens.\r\nHere, bloodthirsty men roam this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nUngelc is s!\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n(3) There are also abstract poems that diverge from reality; for example, \r\nfantasies and dream poems, certain \r\nmetaphysical poems and symbolist poems, ballads and other poems that invoke the supernatural, \r\nand poems that employ elements of surrealism. An early example of English \r\nsurrealism appears in Layamon\'s Brut, written circa 1100 AD, in which the \r\nfloating corpses of dead warriors are transformed into fish:\r\n\r\nNow he stands on a hill overlooking the Avon,\r\nseeing steel fishes girded with swords in the stream,\r\ntheir swimming days done,\r\ntheir scales a-gleam like gold-plated shields,\r\ntheir fish-spines floating like shattered spears.\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI have included examples of each type of abstraction on this page. For the first category I \r\nwill use the term aural, for the second non-concrete and for the third \r\nnon-literal. Please keep in mind that there is often crossover, so that one \r\npoem may include multiple elements. My working definition \r\nof abstract poetry will be poetry that is not meant to be taken completely \r\nliterally. Conversely, I will define concrete poetry and concrete imagery \r\nto be poetry and images that can be taken literally (although there may be \r\nmetaphors that add layers of meaning). Good examples of poems with concrete \r\nimagery are Robert Frost\'s famous poems The Road Not Taken and Stopping By \r\nWoods on a Snowy Evening. While both poems can be read metaphorically, they \r\ndon\'t have to be, and the images work if only taken literally. \r\n\r\nFor whatever it\'s worth, my top ten writers of abstract poetry are William \r\nBlake, Hart Crane, e. e. cummings, Emily Dickinson, John Donne, Langston Hughes, \r\nSylvia Plath, William Shakespeare, Wallace Stevens and William Butler Yeats.\r\n\r\nOther poets who have written abstract poems or have employed abstractions in their \r\npoems include Conrad Aiken, Maya Angelou, W. H. Auden, Charles Baudelaire, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, \r\nJorge Luis Borges, Robert Burns, Lord Byron, \r\nLucille Clifton, Ernest Dowson, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Thomas Hardy, Robert Hayden, \r\nRobinson Jeffers, John Keats, Philip Larkin, Robert Lowell, John Milton, Pablo \r\nNeruda, Wilfred Owen, Edgar Allan Poe, \r\nEzra Pound, Rainer Maria Rilke, Arthur Rimbaud, Anne Sexton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, \r\nCharles Simic, Edmund Spenser, Alfred \r\nTennyson, Paul Val\xe9ry, Paul Verlaine, Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde, William Carlos Williams, William Wordsworth, \r\nRichard Wright, Thomas Wyatt and Elinor Wylie. I have \r\nalso included English translations of poems by Anonymous, Basho, Charles \r\nBaudelaire, Caedmon, William Dunbar, Goethe, Pablo Neruda, Rumi, Sappho \r\nand King Solomon (or whoever wrote the biblical Song of Songs). The forms of poetry \r\nfound on this page include ballads, epigrams, free verse, haiku, limericks, odes, sestinas, \r\nsonnets, villanelles and waka (tanka). \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... you are whatever a moon has always meant \r\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you ...\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love you as certain dark things are to be loved,\r\nin secret, between the shadow and the soul.\r\nPablo Neruda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from Macbeth\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\r\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\r\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\r\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\r\nLifes but a walking shadow, a poor player\r\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\r\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\nSignifying nothing.\r\n\r\nThis passage is both non-concrete and non-literal. The meaning is not primarily \r\nderived from the images; rather the images are used to advance the abstract idea \r\nthat time makes life seem like a bad actor in a meaningless play. Other famous \r\nexamples of abstract poetry by William Shakespeare include the To be or not to \r\nbe soliloquy in Hamlet and the All the world\'s a stage passage in As You \r\nLike It. Shakespeare\'s plays were primarily written in unrhymed blank verse and \r\nthus qualify as poetry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a short poem of mine that attempts to describe poetic vision ...\r\n\r\nWhat the Poet Sees\r\nby \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat the poet sees, \r\nhe sees as a swimmer underwater \r\nwatching the shoreline blur \r\nsees through his breaths weightless bubbles ... \r\nBoth worlds grow obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\nare unbeautiful and have comfortable minds\r\n(also, with the church\'s protestant blessings\r\ndaughters, unscented shapeless spirited)\r\nthey believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,\r\nare invariably interested in so many things\r\nat the present writing one still finds\r\ndelighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?\r\nperhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy\r\nscandal of Mrs. N and Professor D\r\n.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above\r\nCambridge if sometimes in its box of\r\nsky lavender and cornerless, the\r\nmoon rattles like a fragment of angry candy\r\n\r\nThis poem is non-literal and employs surrealistic images such as the moon \r\nrattling in a box like angry candy (has candy ever been angry?). We \r\nunderstand what e. e. cummings is saying, but we understand him abstractly \r\nrather than concretely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nLight the first light of evening, as in a room\r\nIn which we rest and, for small reason, think\r\nThe world imagined is the ultimate good.\r\n\r\nThis is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. \r\nIt is in that thought that we collect ourselves,\r\nOut of all the indifferences, into one thing:\r\n\r\nWithin a single thing, a single shawl\r\nWrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, \r\nA light, a power, the miraculous influence.\r\n\r\nHere, now, we forget each other and ourselves.\r\nWe feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, \r\nA knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nWithin its vital boundary, in the mind.\r\nWe say God and the imagination are one ... \r\nHow high that highest candle lights the dark.\r\n\r\nOut of this same light, out of the central mind, \r\nWe make a dwelling in the evening air, \r\nIn which being there together is enough.\r\n\r\nThis poem is almost entirely abstract, except for the concrete image of the \r\nshawl, which helps develop the poem\'s central idea. Here we do not find an idea \r\nbased on things, but a thing that helps illuminate abstract ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefugee \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThese Strangers, in a foreign World, \r\nProtection asked of me\r\nBefriend them, lest Yourself in Heaven \r\nBe found a Refugee\r\n\r\nThis poem by one of the first great female American poets still speaks \r\neloquently, passionately and powerfully to the modern world. There is no imagery \r\nhere, no metaphor. Rather, there is an abstract parallel between rejecting a \r\nrefugee on earth and being rejected in heaven. Thus the poem is non-concrete and \r\nnon-literal (unless the reader believes in heaven). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower \r\noperator during World War II, an experience which influenced and provided \r\nmaterial for his poetry.\r\nThis poem is surrealistic and thus non-literal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRondel\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting poem, not only because it\'s sad and lovely, but because \r\nthe poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne! And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to English \r\npoetry, adapting it from the French rondeau. Swinburne was noted for \r\nthe diffuseness of his poetry; it often seems he was conveying feelings more \r\nthrough the sounds of words than through their relationships to their \r\nrespective objects. It should also be noted that the poem\'s images do not create \r\nthe poem\'s central idea, which is stated directly, but merely augment it. \r\nFurthermore, one cannot visually see time passing by on swift and careless \r\nfeet in the form of sighs, smiles and songs. These are abstract ideas that we \r\ncan get without concrete (seeable) images. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDispensing Keys\r\nby Hafiz\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages \r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head\r\nwhenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys \r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\n\r\nI just love the wisdom and spirit of Hafiz in this subversive (pardon the pun) \r\nlittle poem. I can see Trump putting refugees in cages, while Hafiz goes around \r\nletting them out for a moondance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\r\n\r\nSince the rise of Trump, this poem has taken on new meaning for me and seems \r\nprophetic. Who ever thought the United States would trade in Lady Liberty for an \r\napartheid \r\nwall?\r\nThis poem is surrealistic and thus non-literal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nNever until the mankind making\r\nBird beast and flower\r\nFathering and all humbling darkness\r\nTells with silence the last light breaking\r\nAnd the still hour\r\nIs come of the sea tumbling in harness\r\n\r\nAnd I must enter again the round\r\nZion of the water bead\r\nAnd the synagogue of the ear of corn\r\nShall I let pray the shadow of a sound\r\nOr sow my salt seed\r\nIn the least valley of sackcloth to mourn\r\n\r\nThe majesty and burning of the child\'s death.\r\nI shall not murder\r\nThe mankind of her going with a grave truth\r\nNor blaspheme down the stations of the breath\r\nWith any further\r\nElegy of innocence and youth.\r\n\r\nDeep with the first dead lies London\'s daughter,\r\nRobed in the long friends,\r\nThe grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,\r\nSecret by the unmourning water\r\nOf the riding Thames.\r\nAfter the first death, there is no other.\r\n\r\nThis poem is surrealistic and thus non-literal. In certain phrases it is \r\nalso aural; for instance the round Zion of the water bead. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdge\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe woman is perfected.\r\nHer dead\r\nBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\r\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\r\nFlows in the scrolls of her toga,\r\nHer bare\r\nFeet seem to be saying:\r\nWe have come so far, it is over.\r\nEach dead child coiled, a white serpent,\r\nOne at each little\r\nPitcher of milk, now empty.\r\nShe has folded\r\nThem back into her body as petals\r\nOf a rose close when the garden\r\nStiffens and odors bleed\r\nFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.\r\nThe moon has nothing to be sad about,\r\nStaring from her hood of bone.\r\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\r\nHer blacks crackle and drag.\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first confessional poets. Confessional poets exposed their inner selves to readers \r\nthrough their verse. When we hear songwriters like Janis Ian, Madonna and Taylor \r\nSwift telling us their inmost secrets, they are following in the footsteps of \r\nthe confessional poets. This poem is surrealistic and thus non-literal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrel Man\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nAnd my throat\r\nIs deep with song,\r\nYou did not think\r\nI suffer after\r\nI\'ve held my pain\r\nSo long.\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nYou do not hear\r\nMy inner cry:\r\nBecause my feet\r\nAre gay with dancing,\r\nYou do not know\r\nI die.\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes was one of the first American poets to create a fusion between \r\nthe blues, jazz and modern poetry.\r\nThis poem is non-concrete; it does more telling than showing. But really \r\nthere\'s nothing wrong with that when the writing is so good and so effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nThis poem uses concrete imagery, but only to advance the most abstract of ideas: \r\nthat we are not really here, that everything we see and experience is really \r\nnothing. Rene Descartes said, I think, therefore I am. In this poem, Wallace \r\nStevens seems to disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpigram Engraved on the Collar of a Dog Which I Gave to His Royal \r\nHighness\r\nby Alexander Pope\r\n\r\nI am his highness\'s dog at Kew; \r\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you? \r\n\r\nAlexander Pope, a poet famous for his satires such as The Dunciad and\r\nThe Rape of the Lock, wrote this epigram in the 1730s and had it \r\nengraved on the collar of one of his puppies, which he gave to Frederick, Prince \r\nof Wales. There is no image, no metaphor. The poem is non-literal because dogs \r\ndon\'t talk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nmysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. Frye, who had never written a poem before, composed the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t even visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaiku and Haiku-Like Poems \r\n\r\nLightning\r\nshatters the darkness:\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek.\r\nMatsuo Basho, loose translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\nSappho of Lesbos, loose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho is the first great lyric that poet that we know by name today. The term \r\nlyric derives from the lyre, a harp-like musical instrument. Sappho is thus \r\nthe original singer-songwriter, and the artistic mother not only of lyric poets \r\nlike Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson, but also of \r\nsinger-songwriters like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Sam \r\nCooke and Carole King. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake may have been the most influential poet/artist of all time. If \r\nyou\'re interested to know why, you can click here:\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake the World\'s Most Influential Poet/Artist. Blake was a mystic \r\nwho said that he communicated with angels and saints on a daily basis. In \r\naddition to being one of England\'s greatest poets, he may have been its greatest \r\npainter and engraver as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Bees Are Few\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, \r\nOne clover, and a bee, \r\nAnd revery. \r\nThe revery alone will do, \r\nIf bees are few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon ballad, circa 990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nhuge, battle-strong arms grabbed and engulfed me.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s Notes: This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a \r\nwild lament, a lover\'s lament, a passion play, a riddle, a song, or an early \r\nballad (it may be the earliest English poem with a refrain). However, most scholars place it within the genre of the frauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\nextant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage; it seems likely that the poet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of \r\nancient scops pretending to be women. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called \r\nthe first English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and \r\nmocking the man who has been raping and impregnating her. And the poem\'s closing \r\nmetaphor of a loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never \r\nharmonized remains one of the strongest in the English language, or any \r\nlanguage.Michael R.

H. Auden\r\n\r\nLost on a fogbound spit of sand\r\nin shoes that pinch me, close at hand\r\nI hear the splash of Charon\'s oar\r\nthat ferries no one to a happy shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Be The Verse \r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nThey fuck you up, your mum and dad. \r\nThey may not mean to, but they do. \r\nThey fill you with the faults they had \r\nAnd add some extra, just for you. \r\n\r\nBut they were fucked up in their turn \r\nBy fools in old-style hats and coats, \r\nWho half the time were soppy-stern \r\nAnd half at one another\'s throats. \r\n\r\nMan hands on misery to man. \r\nIt deepens like a coastal shelf. \r\nGet out as early as you can, \r\nAnd don\'t have any kids yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet No Charitable Hope\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nNow let no charitable hope \r\nConfuse my mind with images \r\nOf eagle and of antelope: \r\nI am in nature none of these. \r\n\r\nI was, being human, born alone; \r\nI am, being woman, hard beset; \r\nI live by squeezing from a stone \r\nThe little nourishment I get. \r\n\r\nIn masks outrageous and austere \r\nThe years go by in single file; \r\nBut none has merited my fear, \r\nAnd none has quite escaped my smile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServitude\r\nby Anne Reeve Aldrich\r\n\r\nThe church was dim at vespers.\r\nMy eyes were on the Rood.\r\nBut yet I felt thee near me,\r\nIn every drop of blood.\r\n\r\nIn helpless, trembling bondage\r\nMy soul\'s weight lies on thee,\r\nO call me not at dead of night,\r\nLest I should come to thee!\r\n\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers. Dont cry\r\nthe best gesture of my brain is less than\r\nyour eyelids flutter which says\r\n\r\nwe are for each other: then\r\nlaugh, leaning back in my arms\r\nfor lifes not a paragraph\r\n\r\nAnd death i think is no parenthesis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of wanton loveliness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that men hold dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you\r\nthrough lustrous flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no leaf nor petal of rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair flower of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would plant love\'s tendrils again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nThe mill-stream, now that noises cease,\r\nIs all that does not hold its peace;\r\nUnder the bridge it murmurs by,\r\nAnd here are night and hell and I.\r\n\r\nWho made the world I cannot tell;\r\n\'Tis made, and here I am in hell.\r\nMy hand, though now my knuckles bleed,\r\nI never soiled with such a deed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, no doubt, in time gone by,\r\nSome have suffered more than I,\r\nWho only spend the night alone\r\nAnd strike my fist upon the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stayby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lordby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nCrossing alone the nighted ferry\r\n With the one coin for fee,\r\nWhom, on the wharf of Lethe waiting,\r\n Count you to find?

Burch\r\n\r\nNow we must honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the eternal Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the first Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\r\nGuardian of mankind. Then he,\r\nthe eternal Lord,\r\nafterwards made the middle earth for men, Master almighty.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Old English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn, \r\nwhich was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the scholar \r\nBede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who worked at the monastery of \r\nWhitby, a small English fishing village. C\xe6dmon, as Bede\'s story goes, was given the gift of poetic composition by an angel.\r\nLines from C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn are reminiscent of the much later work of Gerard Manley \r\nHopkins. For instance, compare the first line above to certain lines from this \r\npoem by Hopkins:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\ndom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\nOf the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\nAs a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\nRebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\nBuckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\nNo wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\nFall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Is Too Much With Usby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\r\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\r\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\r\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\r\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\r\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\r\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\r\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\r\nIt moves us not.Great God! I\'d rather be\r\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\r\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\r\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\r\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\r\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreath\xe8d horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice to a Girlby Sara Teasdale\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed;\r\nLay that on your heart,\r\nMy young angry dear;\r\nThis truth, this hard and precious stone,\r\nLay it on your hot cheek,\r\nLet it hide your tear.\r\nHold it like a crystal\r\nWhen you are alone\r\nAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.\r\nLong, look long and you will be blessed:\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfton Water\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\r\nFlow gently, I\'ll sing thee a song in thy praise;\r\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\r\nThou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro\' the glen,\r\nYe wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,\r\nThou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,\r\nI charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.\r\nHow lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills,\r\nFar mark\'d with the courses of clear winding rills;\r\nThere daily I wander as noon rises high,\r\nMy flocks and my Mary\'s sweet cot in my eye.\r\nHow pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,\r\nWhere wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;\r\nThere oft, as mild Ev\'ning sweeps over the lea,\r\nThe sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.\r\nThy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,\r\nAnd winds by the cot where my Mary resides,\r\nHow wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,\r\nAs gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave.\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\r\nFlow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;\r\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dream Deferred\r\n\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nWhat happens to a dream deferred?\r\n\r\nDoes it dry up\r\nlike a raisin in the sun?\r\nOr fester like a sore\r\nAnd then run?\r\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\r\nOr crust and sugar over\r\nlike a syrupy sweet?\r\n\r\nMaybe it just sags\r\nlike a heavy load.\r\n\r\nOr does it explode?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\r\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\r\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\n\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\n\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\n\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\nHer face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Stealby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\r\nI had no human fears:\r\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\r\nThe touch of earthly years.\r\n\r\nNo motion has she now, no force;\r\nShe neither hears nor sees;\r\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\r\nWith rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.

O pray the earth enfold\r\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s wife had waited long,\r\nThe tea was cold, the fire was dead;\r\nAnd there might yet be nothing wrong\r\nIn how he went and what he said:\r\nThere are no millers any more,\r\nWas all that she had heard him say;\r\nAnd he had lingered at the door\r\nSo long it seemed like yesterday.\r\nSick with a fear that had no form\r\nShe knew that she was there at last;\r\nAnd in the mill there was a warm\r\nAnd mealy fragrance of the past.\r\nWhat else there was would only seem\r\nTo say again what he had meant;\r\nAnd what was hanging from a beam\r\nWould not have heeded where she went.\r\nAnd if she thought it followed her,\r\nShe may have reasoned in the dark\r\nThat one way of the few there were\r\nWould hide her and would leave no mark:\r\nBlack water, smooth above the weir\r\nLike starry velvet in the night,\r\nThough ruffled once, would soon appear\r\nThe same as ever to the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Earthwardby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April\r\nShakes out her rain-drenched hair,\r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted,\r\nI shall not care.\r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful\r\nWhen rain bends down the bough;\r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted\r\nThan you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tyger\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nTyger!

Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?\r\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?\r\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.\r\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?\r\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)\r\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might.

Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silken Tent\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nShe is as in a field a silken tent\r\nAt midday when the sunny summer breeze\r\nHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,\r\nSo that in guys it gently sways at ease,\r\nAnd its supporting central cedar pole,\r\nThat is its pinnacle to heavenward\r\nAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,\r\nSeems to owe naught to any single cord,\r\nBut strictly held by none, is loosely bound\r\nBy countless silken ties of love and thought\r\nTo everything on earth the compass round,\r\nAnd only by one\'s going slightly taut\r\nIn the capriciousness of summer air\r\nIs of the slightest bondage made aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tDream Variations\r\n\t\r\n\tby Langston Hughes\r\nTo fling my arms wide\r\nIn some place of the sun,\r\nTo whirl and to dance\r\nTill the white day is done.\r\nThen rest at cool evening\r\nBeneath a tall tree\r\nWhile night comes on gently,\r\nDark like me\r\nThat is my dream!\r\nTo fling my arms wide\r\nIn the face of the sun,\r\nDance! Whirl! Whirl!\r\nTill the quick day is done.\r\nRest at pale evening . . .\r\nA tall, slim tree . . .\r\nNight coming tenderly\r\nBlack like me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblessing the boats\r\nby Lucille Clifton\r\n\r\n(at St. Mary\'s)\r\n\r\nmay the tide\r\nthat is entering even now\r\nthe lip of our understanding\r\ncarry you out\r\nbeyond the face of fear\r\nmay you kiss\r\nthe wind then turn from it\r\ncertain that it will\r\nlove your back may you\r\nopen your eyes to water\r\nwater waving forever\r\nand may you in your innocence\r\nsail through this to that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho ever loved\r\nby Christopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is overruled by fate.\r\nWhen two are stripped, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should love, the other win;\r\n\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows; let it suffice\r\nWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever loved, that loved not at first sight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night,\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors;\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarewell, Love\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nFarewell, Love, and all thy laws for ever:\r\nThy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.\r\nSenec and Plato call me from thy lore,\r\nTo perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour.\r\nIn blind error when I did persever,\r\nThy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,\r\nHath taught me to set in trifles no store,\r\nAnd scape forth, since liberty is lever. [more desirable]\r\nTherefore farewell, go trouble younger hearts,\r\nAnd in me claim no more authority;\r\nWith idle youth go use thy property,\r\nAnd thereon spend thy many brittle darts.\r\nFor, hitherto though I\'ve lost my time,\r\nMe lusteth no longer rotten boughs to climb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeaven-Haven\r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI have desired to go\r\nWhere springs not fail,\r\nTo fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,\r\nAnd a few lilies blow.\r\n\r\nAnd I have asked to be\r\nWhere no storms come,\r\nWhere the green swell is in the havens dumb,\r\nAnd out of the swing of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove calls, everywhere and always.\r\nWe\'re sky bound. \r\nAre you coming?\r\nRumi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Child\'s Amaze\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nSilent and amazed, even when a little boy,\r\nI remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,\r\nAs contending against some being or influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dreams of My Heart\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nThe dreams of my heart and my mind pass,\r\nNothing stays with me long,\r\nBut I have had from a child\r\nThe deep solace of song;\r\n\r\nIf that should ever leave me,\r\nLet me find death and stay\r\nWith things whose tunes are played out and forgotten\r\nLike the rain of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh! Sunflower\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAh! sunflower, weary of time,\r\nWho countest the steps of the sun,\r\nSeeking after that sweet golden clime\r\nWhere the travellers journey is done;\r\n\r\nWhere the youth pined away with desire,\r\nAnd the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\r\nArise from their graves and aspire;\r\nWhere my sunflower wishes to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Clear Midnight\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nThis is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,\r\nAway from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,\r\nThee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou lovest \r\nbest.\r\nNight, sleep, death and the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Am\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\nI am: yet what I am none cares or knows,\r\nMy friends forsake me like a memory lost;\r\nI am the self-consumer of my woes,\r\nThey rise and vanish in oblivious host,\r\nLike shades in love and death\'s oblivion lost;\r\nAnd yet I am! and live with shadows tost\r\n\r\nInto the nothingness of scorn and noise,\r\nInto the living sea of waking dreams,\r\nWhere there is neither sense of life nor joys,\r\nBut the vast shipwreck of my life\'s esteems;\r\nAnd e\'en the dearestthat I loved the best\r\nAre strangenay, rather stranger than the rest.\r\n\r\nI long for scenes where man has never trod;\r\nA place where woman never smil\'d or wept;\r\nThere to abide with my creator, God,\r\nAnd sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:\r\nUntroubling and untroubled where I lie;\r\nThe grass belowabove the vaulted sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 73: That Time of Year\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west;\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\r\nDeaths second self, that seals up all in rest.\r\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\r\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\r\nAs the deathbed whereon it must expire,\r\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\r\nThis thou perceivst, which makes thy love more strong,\r\nTo love that well which thou must leave ere long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis page contains primarily shorter lyric poems.
