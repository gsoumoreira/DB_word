This page contains modern English translations of poems by the \r\nOriental masters of haiku (also called hokku) and waka/tanka. Included are the \r\nhaunting death poems of Basho and Buson. I have also included translations of \r\nhaiku-like epigrams written by Sappho and other masters of ancient Greek poetry. \r\nMasters of the haiku, tanka/waka, epigram and similar forms represented here \r\ninclude Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, Fukuda Chiyo-ni, Glaucus, Hafiz, Sekitei Hara, Kobayashi Issa, Ono no Komachi, Sappho of Lesbos, \r\nIppekiro Nakatsuka, Plato, Rumi, Ryokan, Yamaguchi Seishi, Takaha Shugyo, Hisajo Sugita, Kyoshi Takahama, Inahata Teiko \r\nand  no Yasumaro.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I call my translations loose translations and \r\ninterpretations because they are not literal word-for-word translations. \r\nI begin with my personal interpretation of a poem and \r\ntranslate accordingly. To critics who object to variations from the original \r\ntexts, my response is that there are often substantial disagreements among even \r\nthe most accomplished translators. Variations begin with the \r\nreadings because different people get different things from \r\ndifferent poems. And a strict word-for-word translation will seldom, if ever, \r\nresult in poetry. In my opinion translation is much closer to an art than a \r\nperfect science and I side with Rabindranath Tagore, who said he needed some \r\nleeway in order to produce poetry in another language when he translated his own \r\npoems into English.MRB\r\n\r\nI will begin with my translations of some of my \r\nfavorite haiku by the master Basho:\r\n\r\nThe first soft snow:\r\n\tleaves of the awed jonquil\r\nbow low\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nCome, investigate loneliness!\r\na solitary leaf\r\nclings to the Kiri tree\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe cheerful-chirping cricket\r\ncontends gray autumn\'s gay,\r\ncontemptuous of frost\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhistle on, twilight whippoorwill,\r\nsolemn evangelist\r\nof loneliness\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIf you like the haiku above, I believe you will find this page worth further \r\nexploration and investigation ...\r\n\r\nSing, my sacred tortoiseshell lyre;\r\ncome, let my words\r\naccompany your voice\r\n Sappho of Lesbos\r\n\r\nAs I worked on our journal\'s pages about the best poems of all time, the haiku below appeared to me \r\nfrom out of the blue, and without any forethought on my part. As a \r\nresult, I ended up not only \r\ncreating this page, but also translating a number of haiku in the \r\nprocess. Did some ancient master provide the gift below as a way of encouraging me to \r\npay oriental poetry its proper due? In any case, here\'s my poem:\r\n\r\nDark-bosomed clouds\r\npregnant with heavy thunder ...\r\nthe water breaks\r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s my translation of one of my favorite haiku, by the Japanese master Matsuo Basho (1644-1694):\r\n\r\nThe butterfly\r\nperfuming its wings\r\nfans the orchid\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt\'s interesting, I believe, to note the similarities between three very \r\ndifferent poems by three very different poets. Sappho was an ancient Greek \r\nfemale poet from the island of Lesbos; her homoeroticism lends denotations and \r\nconnotations to our terms Lesbian and Sapphic. Matsuo Basho was an ancient \r\nJapanese master of brief, startlingly clear haiku, who influenced (and continues \r\nto influence) Western poets. I\'m an American poet with an affinity \r\nfor all sorts of poetry, who\'s glad we live in a world where so much good and \r\ngreat poetry is freely accessible. The three poems share a number of important \r\ncharacteristics: brevity, conciseness, clarity, and the use of imagery to convey \r\nemotion. In each poem the poet uses an image to convey more information than \r\nthe literal words. Sappho invokes the lyre, the stringed instrument that \r\ngave us our term lyric. When she calls the lyre sacred, she invokes \r\nthe Muses (gods the ancient Greeks invented to explain the source of poetry; \r\nthey considered it divine).  \r\nSappho\'s voice may be said to combine her voice, the \r\nvoice of the gods, and the voice of the lyre. So her apparently simple poem may \r\nbe \r\nanything but. Basho\'s poem is another deceptively simple \r\nmasterpiece, as it explores the symbiotic nature of life. The butterfly benefits \r\nfrom the perfumes and nectars of flowers; in the process of imbibing their \r\nnectar it helps pollinate them. Basho\'s poem is an example of art mirroring \r\nnature; it\'s hard to say which is more lovely: the butterfly dancing with the \r\norchid, or the exquisitely wrought poem. My poem compares a thunderstorm\'s \r\ndownpour to a pregnant woman\'s water breaking. I think it\'s an effective image, \r\nalthough I don\'t expect the reader to think me worthy of the great masters. \r\nHopefully, however, I can pay them the homage they\'re justly due with my \r\ntranslations ...\r\n\r\nPausing between clouds\r\nthe moon rests\r\nin the eyes of its beholders\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe poem above demonstrates power through simplicity in the hands \r\nof a master. My translation has a slightly different take on the poem, and I \r\ncan\'t say that it\'s absolutely correct, but I like it. I believe this poem \r\nhints at the connection between the stages of the moon and human life: both are \r\na series of passages and rests. If we \r\nglimpse the moon at night, slipping between clouds, it can seem eerily lovely, \r\nhaunting and restful at the same time. When a master like Basho deftly invokes \r\nthe image of the moon, he can appeal to all the things we know (or think we \r\nknow) and feel about the moon. And because the moon symbolizes love, to see it \r\nreflected in lovers\' eyes may seem deeply significant, perhaps even mystical. \r\nThe poem may suggest this, without saying it directly. \r\n\r\nOh, fallen camellias,\r\nif I were you,\r\nI\'d leap into the torrent!\r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe haiku above is another I especially love, because the poet draws the \r\nreader into feeling empathy for, and sympathizing with, dying flowers. When I \r\ninterpret the poem, I see petals falling beside rapidly rushing water and hear the \r\npoet suggesting that a quick death is better than a slow, lingering \r\ndeath. One might say the poem suggests that suicide or euthanasia \r\nmay be preferable to a long, drawn-out death, although there are other \r\ninterpretations. A good poem may have as many different interpretations \r\nas there are readers.\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n Sappho, fragment 42, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThere is a family resemblance between the brief, concise, evocative lyrics of \r\nSappho and the brief, concise, evocative lyrics of the Oriental masters.\r\n\r\nwhen you opened\r\nmy letter\r\nwere you surprised\r\nmy heart\r\nfell out?\r\n\r\nnext door\r\nthe lovemaking\r\nsubsides\r\nstars fall\r\nfrom other worlds\r\n\r\nan old photo\r\nof my parents\r\nyoung and happy\r\nof all the things I own\r\nthat is the saddest\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three poems above are by Michael Windsor McClintock, a contemporary American poet. In the late 1960s, he \r\nwas the Assistant Editor of Haiku Highlights. During the 1970s, he was the \r\nAssistant Editor of Modern Haiku and also edited the American Haiku Poets Series \r\nand Seer Ox: American Senryu Magazine. I think his poems demonstrate \r\nhow much emotion a simple, clear image can convey: a letter being opened, a star \r\nfalling, a photo of loved ones touching our hearts. I think the ancient \r\nmasters would admire such poems.\r\n\r\nOne apple, alone\r\nin the abandoned orchard\r\nreddens for winter\r\n Patrick Blanche, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe poem above is by a French poet; it illustrates how the poetry of Oriental \r\nmasters like Basho has influenced poets around the world.\r\n\r\nGrasses wilt:\r\nthe braking locomotive\r\ngrinds to a halt\r\n\r\n Yamaguchi Seishi, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWilting autumn grasses are compared to a braking locomotive grinding \r\nto a halt. Two simple images speak worlds, in the hands of a skilled poet.\r\n\r\nOur life here on earth:\r\nto what shall we compare it?\r\nIt is not like a rowboat\r\ndeparting at daybreak,\r\nleaving no trace of us in its wake?\r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe poem above is a tanka, also known as waka. The poem speaks of the human \r\ncondition: how many people die every day leaving no wake, no trace that they \r\never existed? The best poets are truth-tellers. They give readers the unadulterated truth, \r\nas they perceive it.\r\n\r\nOn rain-drenched branches\r\nbuds of the apricot tree\r\nswell into blossom,\r\ntrembling anxiously,\r\nas if waiting to be deflowered ...\r\n\r\n Kazuhiko Ito, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe poem above is another tanka. It metaphorically compares human virginity to \r\nthe virgin buds of an apricot tree (or at least that is my interpretation of the \r\npoem). In my translation, I employed three rhymes: tree, anxiously and \r\nnervously. While rhyme is frowned upon in some haiku/tanka circles, I \r\nsee no reason to avoid rhymes that work. I also employed alliteration: \r\nbranches, buds and blossom. Readers will have to decide for themselves if \r\nsuch English poetic devices add to the translation or detract from it.\r\n\r\nAs I slept in isolation\r\nmy desired beloved appeared to me;\r\ntherefore, dreams have become my reality\r\nand consolation.\r\nOno no Komachi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis is another tanka by a female master of the form. More \r\npoems by Ono no Komachi can be found later on this page, in the extended \r\ntanka/waka section.\r\n\r\nGraven images of long-departed gods,\r\ndry spiritless leaves:\r\ncompanions of the temple porch\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBasho\'s poem above suggests that the ancient gods either never existed or are \r\nlong-departed, and are no more effective than dead leaves on a temple porch. \r\n\r\nSee: whose surviving sons\r\nvisit the ancestral graves\r\nwhite-bearded, with trembling canes?\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAgain, Basho speaks honestly, with a daunting but compelling truthfulness. The \r\nancient Greek poets also spoke of death forthrightly. Here\'s an ancient Greek \r\nepitaph (a gravestone inscription) that rivals Basho:\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gull\r\nin his high, lonely circuits, may tell.\r\n Michael R. Burch, after Glaucus\r\n\r\nHere\'s another Greek epitaph (a form of epigram) that matches the best haiku in \r\nsimplicity, honesty, clarity and forthrightness:\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nbut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\n Michael R. Burch, after Plato\r\n\r\nHere\'s a much happier poem by a Sufi Muslim mystic:\r\n\r\n\r\nI caught the happy virus last night\r\nWhen I was out singing beneath the stars.\r\nIt is remarkably contagious\r\nSo kiss me.\r\nHafiz\r\n\r\nHere\'s a poem by another Sufi mystic:\r\n\r\nWhen I am with you, we stay up all night.\r\nWhen you\'re not here, I can\'t go to sleep.\r\nPraise God for these two insomnias!\r\nAnd the difference between them.\r\nJalaluddin Rumi, translation/interpretation by Coleman Barks\r\n\r\nThe two poems below are by Hisajo Sugita, a female poet:\r\n\r\nI remove my beautiful kimono:\r\nits varied braids\r\nsurround and entwine my body\r\n\r\n Hisajo Sugita, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis day of chrysanthemums\r\nI shake and comb my wet hair,\r\nas their petals shed rain\r\n\r\n Hisajo Sugita, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere are a number of poems by Matsuo Basho:\r\n\r\nThis darkening autumn:\r\nmy neighbor,\r\nhow does he continue?\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWinter coming:\r\nhow does\r\nmy neighbor\r\nfare?\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLet us arrange\r\nthese lovely flowers in the bowl\r\nsince there\'s no rice\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn ancient pond,\r\nthe frog leaps:\r\nthe silver plop and gurgle of water\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nExplosion! \r\nThe frog returns \r\nto its lily pad.\r\nMichael R. Burch \r\n\r\nThe first chill rain:\r\npoor monkey, you too could use\r\na woven cape of straw\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLightning\r\nshatters the darkness\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLightning\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek\r\nsevers the darkness\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA flash of lightning\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek\r\nsplits the void\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nFever-felled mid-path\r\nmy dreams resurrect, to trek\r\ninto a hollow land\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nToo ill to travel,\r\nnow only my autumn dreams\r\nsurvey these withering fields\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch; \r\nthis has been called Basho\'s death poem\r\n\r\nThis snowy morning:\r\ncries of the crow I despise\r\n(ah, but so beautiful!)\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLike a heavy fragrance\r\nsnow-flakes settle:\r\nlilies on the rocks\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe sea darkening,\r\nthe voices of the wild ducks:\r\nmy mysterious companions!\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWill we meet again?\r\nHere at your flowering grave:\r\ntwo white butterflies\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThese brown summer grasses?\r\nThe only remains\r\nof invincible warriors ...\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn empty road\r\nlonelier than abandonment:\r\nthis autumn evening\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSpring has come:\r\nthe nameless hill\r\nlies shrouded in mist\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Haiku\r\n\r\nThese are my translations of some of the oldest \r\nJapanese \r\nwaka, which evolved into poetic forms such as tanka, renga and \r\nhaiku over time. My translations are excerpts from theKojiki \r\n(the Record of Ancient Matters), a book composed around 711-712 A.D. by the \r\nhistorian and poet  \r\nno Yasumaro. TheKojiki relates Japans mythological beginnings and the \r\nhistory of its imperial line. Like Virgil\'s Aeneid, the \r\nKojiki seeks to legitimize rulers by recounting their roots. These are \r\nlines from one of the oldest Japanese poems, found in the oldest Japanese book:\r\n\r\nWhile you decline to cry,\r\nhigh on the mountainside\r\na single stalk of plumegrass wilts.\r\n  no Yasumaro (circa 711), loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s another excerpt, with a humorous twist, from theKojiki:\r\n\r\nHush, cawing crows; what rackets you make!\r\nHeaven\'s indignant messengers,\r\nyou remind me of wordsmiths!\r\n  no Yasumaro (circa 711), loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s another, this one a poem of love and longing:\r\n\r\nOnyx, this gem-black night.\r\nDowncast, I await your return\r\nlike the rising sun, unrivaled in splendor.\r\n  no Yasumaro (circa 711), loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMore Haiku by Various Poets\r\n\r\nRight at my feet!\r\nWhen did you arrive here,\r\nsnail?\r\n\r\n Kobayashi Issa, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R.
