By way of possible answers, here are my \nnominations for the greatest human achievements in poetry, literature, art, \nmusic, philosophy, science and sports. I started thinking about this page as I \nconsidered two very different examples of human genius: Ronnie O\'Sullivan, a \nprofessional snooker player, and William Butler Yeats, the great Irish poet. \n\ncompiled\nby Michael R. Burch\nThese are my personal nominations for what might be called the search for \nhuman perfection or perhaps brilliance or genius. I have been criticized \nfor using such terms, although I don\'t use them frequently or lightly. But do \nthink that\x97in some cases\x97they do apply. \n\nMy Personal Top Ten Human Achievements\n\nSports:\nRonnie O\'Sullivan\'s fourteen perfect snooker breaks and 948 century breaks\nPoetry: The Wild Swans at Coole by William Butler Yeats\nLiterature: The major plays of William Shakespeare\nMusic: Flower Duet by Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca\nArt: The major works of Michelangelo \nPhilosophy: The invaluable skepticism of Socrates\nArchitecture: The Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge (tie)\nScience: Albert Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity (both General and Special)\nTechnology: The Operating System, man\'s most complex product to date\nExploration/Discovery: Neil Armstrong\'s giant leap for mankind when he walked \non the moon\n\nHonorable Mention: the inventions and/or developments of fire, tools, weapons, \nclothes, language, writing, poetry, music, art, dance, mathematics, medicine, \nhouses, boats, the wheel, wagons and chariots, domesticated animals, irrigation \nand agriculture; the first towns and cities; cartography and navigation; the \nprinting press; telescopes; vaccines; railways and trains; the transcontinental \nrailroad; the telegraph; the telephone; automobiles; airplanes; submarines; \nDarwin\'s theory of evolution; the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA; quantum \nmechanics; radio; television; radar; splitting the atom; atomic energy; the \natomic bomb; the computer; the Internet; social media; the smart phone; apps; \nmapping the human genome; rockets and space flight; the Magna Carta; the \nDeclaration of Independence; modern democracy; human rights movements; the \nLeague of Nations; the United Nations; the fall of the Berlin Wall\n\nRonnie O\'Sullivan\'s fourteen perfect snooker breaks and 948 century breaks. Anyone who has played \npool on a six-foot bar table with generous pockets knows it\'s still very \ndifficult to run nine balls in numeric order. If we graduate to a nine-foot \nBrunswick Gold Crown table with tighter pockets, making nine balls gets a lot \nharder and even the top pros have been known to miss what seem like easy \nshots. To move up to a twelve-foot English snooker table with ultra-tight \npockets is like moving from the Earth to Jupiter with its massive gravity. Not \nonly are the long shots much longer and more difficult, but many of the shots \nare impossible to reach and require an extra-long bridge. Even \nthe best professional pool players would struggle on a twelve-foot snooker table. So to watch \nRonnie O\'Sullivan achieve perfection fourteen times, by scoring 147 points, \nalmost defies comprehension. And he does it by flying around the table, potting \nred balls almost faster than the seven can be re-spotted. If you want to see \nhuman perfection, hie thee to YouTube and do a search for: Ronnie O\'Sullivan \n147. Then prepare to be amazed. \n\nOther sports achievements for the ages include Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing \nNorgay scaling Mt. Everest for the first time in 1953, Gertrude Ederle swimming \nthe English Channel and beating the men\'s record by over two hours, Michael \nPhelps winning 28 Olympic medals for swimming (23 of them gold), Nadia Comaneci \nscoring ten after ten at the 1976 Olympics, Rod Laver winning two tennis grand \nslams, Martina Navratilova\'s 20 Wimbledon titles, Rafael Nadal on clay, Pele leading Brazil to three \nFIFA world cups while scoring 1,283 career goals with 92 hat tricks, Pele\'s \nfemale counterpart Marta, the goal-scoring magic of Lionel Messi and Diego \nMaradona, Jesse Owens destroying Hitler\'s myth of the Aryan superman by \nsetting three world records in 70 minutes at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Usain \nBolt outracing the wind, Javier Sotomayer clearing eight feet in the high jump, \nWayne Gretzky rewriting the hockey record books with four seasons with 200 or \nmore points, Jack Nicklaus winning 18 major golf championships, Muhammad Ali \nwinning the world heavyweight boxing championship three times including wins \nover Joe Frazier and the unbeatables Sonny Liston and George Foreman, Julio \nC\xe9sar Ch\xe1vez claiming six boxing titles in three weight divisions while winning \n87 straight matches, Wilt Chamberlain scoring 100 points in a basketball game \nand averaging 50 points for an entire NBA season, Bill Walton going 21 for 22 in \nthe 1973 NCAA championship basketball game with his only miss being a \ndisallowed dunk, Pistol Pete Maravich averaging 44.2 points for his college \ncareer (it has been estimated that he would have scored 57 ppg with the \nthree-point shot), the 1972 Miami Dolphins producing the NFL\'s only undefeated \nseason with its no name defense, Peyton Manning having 11 seasons with 4,000 \nor more yards passing, Willie Mosconi running 526 balls at straight pool without \na miss (that\'s 35 freakin\' tables!), Ted Williams getting on base nearly every \nother at-bat for his entire career (.482 OBP), Babe Ruth out-homering all AL \nteams twice while also being the best World Series pitcher of all time, and \nJohnny Vander Meer achieving double perfection by throwing no-hitters in \nconsecutive starts. \n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole by William Butler Yeats seems like a perfect \npoem to me. It has become fashionable for \npeople to say, I don\'t like poetry. And yet the people expressing their \ndisdain for poetry probably love rhyming poems set to music, which we call \npopular songs. Examples of such poems include Blowin\' in the Wind, Let It \nBe, When Doves Cry, Billie Jean, Like a Virgin, Candle in the Wind, \nBorn to Run, and nearly all pop, rock, country, blues, hip hip and rap hits. \nAnd the best poets were better lyricists than the best songwriters. The great poets include Homer, Sappho of Lesbos, Pindar, Dante, Virgil, Ovid, \nMartial, Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, John Milton, John Donne, William \nBlake, Robert Burns, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, William Wordsworth, Percy \nBysshe Shelley, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, A. E. Housman, Basho, \nLi Po, Rainer Maria Rilke, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, \nArthur Rimbaud, Paul Valery, Alexander Pushkin, Anna Akhmatova, Marina \nTsvetaeva, Federico Garcia Lorca, Fernando Pessoa, T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, \nHart Crane, Robert Frost and Pablo Neruda.\n\nOther perfect or near-perfect poems include epigrams by Sappho, haiku by Basho, \nElegy Written in a Country Courtyard by Thomas Gray, The Snow Man and \nSunday Morning by Wallace Stevens, Go Lovely Rose by Edmund Waller, To \nEarthward by Robert Frost, The Convergence of the Twain and The Darkling \nThrush by Thomas Hardy, Requiescat by Oscar Wilde, A Noiseless Patient \nSpider by Walt Whitman, Dulce et Decorum est by Wilfred Owen, The \nHighwayman by Alfred Noyes, and Voyages by Hart Crane, among others.\n\n\nI must admit that I used to say that I didn\'t like opera, the way some people \nsay they don\'t like poetry. But when confronted with \ntruly great opera performances, I was happy to admit that I had been wrong. Today we \nnot only have pure or traditional opera, but also operatic performances like those of Aretha \nFranklin, Josh Groban, Hayley Westenra and Jackie Evancho. One of my all-time \nfavorite operatic performances is Time to Say Goodbye by Andrea Bocelli and \nSarah Brightman. Another is Music of the Night by Michael Crawford. For pure \nopera it\'s hard to top Nessun Dorma as performed by the Three Tenors: Luciano \nPavarotti, Pl\xe1cido Domingo and Jos\xe9 Carreras. Other magnificent opera singers \ninclude Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Franco Corelli, Montserrat Caball\xe9, Natalie \nDessay, Ren\xe9e Fleming, Mario Lanza, Leontyne Price, Joan Sutherland and Richard \nTucker. \n\nIf you still don\'t think you like opera, perhaps try checking out Flower Duet \nby Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca on YouTube. \n\nSpeaking of rhyming poems set to music and opera, Bohemian Rhapsody by Freddie \nMercury and Queen may be the ultimate fusion of poetry, rock and \nopera. Other contenders include Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky \nHorror Picture Show and three offerings by the Who: Tommy, Quadrophenia and \nLove Reign O\'er Me. \n\nAs for the great composers, I have always been partial to the Hallelujah \nChorus from Handel\'s Messiah by George Handel. And of course there\'s The \nQueen of the Night\'s Aria from The Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. \n(The song was first performed by Mozart\'s sister-in-law.) A list of the great \ncomposers would have to include Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Schubert, Chopin, \nVerdi, Brahms, Handel, Debussy, Puccini, Listz, Haydn, Mahler, Monteverdi, \nTchaikovsky, Vivaldi, Stravinsky and Wagner. The fact that we don\'t have to know \ntheir first names is a tribute to their talent and resulting fame. \n\nO Come, O Come Emmanuel by Enya gets my vote as the best female vocal \nperformance of all time. Other contenders include Spanish Harlem by Aretha Franklin, \nAt Last by Etta James, Summertime by Ella Fitzgerald and Janis Joplin, All \nBy Myself by Celine Dion, Nothing Compares 2 U by Sinead O\'Connor, Trouble \nof the World by Mahalia Jackson, Un-Break My Heart by Toni Braxton and I \nWill Always Love You and I Have Nothing by Whitney Houston.\n\nWithout You by Harry Nilsson gets my vote for the most beautiful and moving \nvocal performance by a male singer. Other contenders include All By Myself by Eric \nCarmen, Unchained Melody by Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers, A \nChange is Gonna Come by Sam Cooke, Blue Moon and Fever by Elvis Presley, \nWhen Doves Cry by Prince and Bridge Over Troubled Water by Art Garfunkel of \nSimon and Garfunkel. \n\nThere have been many great artists, but it\'s hard to think of anyone greater \nthat Michelangelo. His masterworks include the \npaintings of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the sculptures David, Bacchus, \nMoses, Madonna of Bruges and Piet\xe0. Other visual artists \nof note include Cezanne, Monet, Caravaggio, van Gogh, Rembrandt, da Vinci, \nRenoir, Rubens, Manet, Dali, Degas, Picasso, Warhol, Raphael, and my personal favorites \nthe romantics William Blake and Dante Gabriel \nRossetti. \n\nAlbert Einstein with his still-hard-to-comprehend Theory of Relativity tops my \nlist for the greatest human intellectual achievement. Well, actually he tops it \ntwice because there were two theories of relativity (the general theory and the \nspecial theory). Other contenders include Isaac Newton (who invented calculus in \nhis spare time!), Charles Darwin, Marie Curie (the only scientist to win Nobel \nprizes in different categories), Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, Socrates, Plato, \nAristotle, Archimedes, Euclid, Hippocrates, Sigmund Freud, Gregor Mendel, Max \nPlank, Niels Bohr and Stephen Hawking. \n\nLeonardo da Vinci tops my list of Renaissance men and women. He was a polymath, \npainter, sketch artist, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, scientist, \ninventor, engineer, anatomist, geologist, cartographer and botanist. Other \ncontenders include Pythagoras, Aristotle, Galileo, Voltaire, Ben Franklin, \nThomas Jefferson, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, \nBlaise Pascal, Alan Turing\n\nThe great philosophers include Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, Epicurus, \nThales, Confucius, Michel de Montaigne, Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich \nNietzsche, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nThe great inventors include Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, \nGeorge Washington Carver, William and Orville Wright and Johannes Gutenberg.\n\n\nThe great playwrights include Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Shakespeare, Marlowe, \nMoliere, Chekov, Henrik Ibsen, Samuel Beckett and Tennessee Williams. \n\nGreat novelists and short story writers include Miguel de Cervantes, Charles \nDickens, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, Charlotte \nBronte, George Eliot, Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Edgar Allan \nPoe, Jules Verne, Virginia Woolf, Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, James \nJoyce, Henry James, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, J. R. R. Tolkien and \nJorge Luis Borges. \n\nGreat explorers and discovers include Alexander the Great, Christopher Columbus, \nJames Cook, Marco Polo and Neil Armstrong \n\nGreat leaders include Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Abraham \nLincoln, George Washington, Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria.\n\nFor sheer physical beauty, it\'s hard to imagine anyone more perfect that a \nluminescent Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. Angels would have a hard time \nout-glowing her. Other breathtaking beauties include Beyonc\xe9, Princess Diana \nSpencer, Ava Gardner, Audrey Hepburn, Iman, Princess Grace Kelly, Veronica Lake, \nGypsy Rose Lee, Marilyn Monroe, Katy Perry, Ginger Rogers, Shakira, Brooke \nShields, Gene Tierney, Elizabeth Taylor and Lana Turner.\n\nI should probably leave male physical beauty up to the fairer sex, but since \nthis is my list, I\'ll take a stab: Elvis Presley, followed by James Dean, Marlon \nBrando, Richard Gere, Sam Cooke, Muhammad Ali, David Beckham, Chris Hemsworth, Brad Pitt, Robert Redford, Gary Barlow, \nDenzel Washington, Omar Sharif, Rock Hudson, Cary Grant. (Ladies, how did I do?)\n\nReligious figures include Buddha, Jesus Christ, Confucius, Mohammed, Moses and \nSaint Paul. \n\nGreat freethinkers and heretics include Bruno, Galileo, William Blake, Percy \nBysshe Shelley, Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde.\n\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
