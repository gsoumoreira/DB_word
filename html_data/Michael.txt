Burch\r\nThere was always a surfeit of light in your presence.\r\nYou stood distinctly apart, not of the humdrum world\r\na chariot of gold in a procession of plywood. \r\nWe were all pioneers of the modern expedient race,\r\nraising the ante: Home Depot to Lowes.\r\nYours was an antique graceThraces or Mesopotamias. \r\nWe were never quite sure of your silver allure,\r\nof your trillium-and-platinum diadem,\r\nof your utter lack of flatware-like utility. \r\nYou told us that nightyour wound would not scar.\r\nThe black moment passed, then you were no more.\r\nThe darker the sky, how much brighter the Star! \r\nThe day of your funeral, I ripped out the crown mold.\r\nYou were this fools gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\r\nfor the children of Gaza and the Nakba\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndont forget ...\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\ndont forget to remember \r\nthat Space is curved \r\n(like your Heart) \r\nand that even Light is bent \r\nby your Gravity.\r\n\r\nI dedicated this poem to the love of my life, but you are welcome to dedicate it \r\nto the love of yours, if you like it.

Burch\r\n\r\nMoonbeams on water \r\nthe reflected light \r\nof a halcyon star\r\nnow drowning in night ...\r\nSo your memories are.\r\n\r\nFootprints on beaches\r\nnow flooding with water;\r\nthe small, broken ribcage\r\nof some primitive slaughter ...\r\nSo near, yet so far.\r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\nIn the first stanza the halcyon star is the sun, which has dropped below the \r\nhorizon and is thus drowning in night. But its light strikes the moon, \r\ncreating moonbeams which are reflected by the water. Sometimes memories seem \r\nthat distant, that faint, that elusive. Footprints are being washed away, a \r\nheart is missing from its ribcage, and even things close at hand can seem \r\ninfinitely beyond our reach. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\nSappho, fragment 42, loose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nHave you tasted the bitterness of tears of despair?\r\nHave you watched the sun sink through such pale, balmless air\r\nthat your heart sought its shell like a crab on a beach,\r\nthen scuttled inside to be safe, out of reach?\r\n\r\nMight I lift you tonight from earths wreckage and damage\r\non these waves gently rising to pay the moon homage?\r\nOr better, perhaps, let me say that I, too,\r\nhave dreamed of infinity . . . windswept and blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething\r\nfor the children of the Holocaust and the Nakba\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSomething inescapable is lost\r\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\r\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\r\nimmeasurable and void.\r\n\r\nSomething uncapturable is gone\r\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\r\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\r\nand remembrance.\r\n\r\nSomething unforgettable is past\r\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\r\nwhich finality swept into a corner, where it lies\r\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhite in the shadows\r\nI see your face,\r\nunbidden. Go, tell\r\nLove it is commonplace;\r\n\r\nTell Regret it is not so rare.\r\n\r\nOur love is not here\r\nthough you smile,\r\nfull of sedulous grace.\r\n\r\nLost in darkness, I fear\r\nthe past is our resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoments\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThere were moments\r\nfull of promise,\r\nlike the petal-scented rainfall\r\nof early spring,\r\nwhen to hold you in my arms\r\nand to kiss your willing lips\r\nseemed everything.\r\n\r\nThere are moments\r\nstrangely empty\r\nfull of pale unearthly twilighthow the cold stars stare!\r\nwhen to be without you\r\nis a dark enchantment\r\nthe night and I share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA short revealing frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\nSappho, fragment 155, loose translation by Michael R.

Who can tell?\r\nTo see is not to know, but you can feel\r\nthe tug sometimesthe gravity, the shell\r\nas lustrous as damp pearl. You sink, you reel \r\n\r\ntoward some draining revelation. Air\r\ntoo thin to grasp, to breath. Such pressure. Gasp.\r\nThe stars invert, electric, everywhere.\r\nAnd so we fall, down-tumbling through nights fissure ...\r\n\r\ntwo beings pale, intent to fall forever\r\naround each otherfumbling at loves tether ...\r\nnow separate, now distant, now together.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterfly\r\nperfuming its wings\r\nfans the orchid\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\t\r\n\tMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\n\tWe are so different.\r\n\r\n\tWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\n\tHis island\'s a fortress, surrounded by fens.\r\n\tHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\r\n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\n\tWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\n\tWhenever it rained and I wept, disconsolate,\r\n\tbig, battle-strong arms grabbed and held me.\r\n\tIt felt good, to a point, but the end was loathsome.\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\n\thas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\n\thave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\n\tTranslator\'s Note:\r\n\t"Wulf and Eadwacer" is one of the truly great poems in the English language: \r\n\ta bittersweet saga of love and perhaps rape and betrayal. This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a wild lament, a lover\'s lament, a \r\n\tpassion play, a riddle, and as a song or early \r\n\tballad with a refrain. However, most modern scholars choose to place it, \r\n\talong with\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament,within \r\n\tthe genre of thefrauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\n\textant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage, although the poet and his/her sex remain unknown. But it seems likely that the  \r\npoet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of ancient warriors \r\n\tand scops pretending \r\nto be women. Wulf and Eadwacer is perhaps the \r\nfirst Old English poem to contain sexual intrigue not adulterated by \r\nChristian monks. It may also be called the first English feminist text, as the \r\n\tspeaker seems to be challenging and mocking the man who has raped and \r\n\timpregnated her. And the poems closing metaphor of a loveless relationship \r\nbeing like a song in which two voices never harmonized remains one of the \r\nstrongest in the English language, or any language. The poem is also notable for \r\n\tits rich ambiguity, which leaves much open to reader \r\n\tinterpretation. For instance, the wolf that has borne the whelp \r\n\tto the woods might be Wulf, the heartsick \r\n\tfemale speaker, Eadwacer, Eadwacer\'s jealous wife, or some other member of the clan. We \r\n\tdo not know what \r\n\thappened to the child in the woods, but we have the impression of a dark \r\n\tcatastrophe: perhaps human sacrifice. Wulf and Eadwacer is also one of the first English poems to employ a refrain, a \r\n\thallmark of the great ballads and villanelles to come. The poem appeared in the Exeter Book, \r\n\tbetween Deor\'s Lament and the riddles, \r\n\tmeaning that it was written no later than around 990 AD. But the poem \r\n\titself is probably older, perhaps much older. I hope readers \r\nenjoy my other translations of this wonderfully powerful, haunting poem that speaks to us from the dawn of \r\n\ttime and \r\nEnglish poetry.Michael R.

Your words revealed the fate\r\nof boys who retched up life here, gagged on lies.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by The Chariton Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sky,\r\nno land:\r\njust snow eternally falling ...\r\n\r\n \r\nKajiwara Hashin, loose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nWHEN you were my playmate and I was yours,\r\nwe spent endless hours with simple toys,\r\nand the sorrows and cares of our indentured days\r\nwere uncomprehended . . . far, far away . . .\r\nfor the temptations and trials we had yet to face\r\nwere lost in the shadows of an unventured maze.\r\n\r\nThen simple pleasures were easy to find\r\nand if they cost us a little, we didn\'t mind;\r\nfor even a penny in a pocket back then\r\nwas one penny too many, a penny to spend.\r\n\r\nThen feelings were feelings and love was just love,\r\nnot a strange, complex mystery to be understood;\r\nwhile sin and damnation meant little to us,\r\nsince forbidden cookies were our only lusts!\r\n\r\nThen we never worried about what we had,\r\nand we were both surewhat was good, what was bad.\r\nAnd we sometimes quarreled, but we didn\'t hate;\r\nwe seldom gave thought to the uncertainties of fate.\r\n\r\nHell, we seldom thought about the next day,\r\nwhen tomorrow seemed hiddenadventures away.\r\nThough sometimes we dreamed of adventures past,\r\nand wondered, at times, why things couldn\'t last.\r\n\r\nStill, we never worried about getting by,\r\nand we didn\'t know that we were to die . . .\r\nwhen we spent endless hours with simple toys,\r\nand I was your playmate, and we were boys.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the poem that made me, because my high \r\nschool English teacher called it beautiful and I took that to mean I was \r\nsurely the Second Coming of Percy Bysshe Shelley! Playmates is the second poem \r\nI remember writing; I believe I was around 13 or 14 at the time. It was \r\noriginally published by The Lyric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Pages by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nfor George Edwin Hurt Sr.\r\nWhen I was a child\r\nI never considered mans impermanence,\r\nfor you were a mountain of adamant stone:\r\na man steadfast, immense,\r\nand your words rang. \r\nAnd when you were gone,\r\nI still heard your voice, which never betrayed,\r\nBe strong and of a good courage,\r\nneither be afraid ...\r\nas the angels sang. \r\nAnd, O!, I believed\r\nfor your words were my truth, and I tried to be brave\r\nthough the years slipped away\r\nwith so little to save\r\nof that talk. \r\nNow I\'m a man\r\na man ... and yet Grandpa ... I\'m still the same child\r\nwho sat at your feet\r\nand learned as you smiled.\r\nBe that rock.\r\n\r\nI don\'t remember when I wrote this poem, but I will guess around age 18 in 1976. \r\nThe verse quoted is from an old, well-worn King James Bible my grandfather gave \r\nme after his only visit to the United States, as he prepared to return to \r\nEngland with my grandmother. I was around eight at the time and didn\'t know if I \r\nwould ever see my grandparents again, so I was heartbrokendestitute, \r\nreally. Fortunately my father was later stationed at an Air Force base in \r\nGermany and we were able to spend four entire summer vacations with my \r\ngrandparents. I was also able to visit them in England several times as an \r\nadult. But the years of separation were very difficult for me and I came to \r\ndetest things that separated me from my family and friends: the departure \r\nplatforms of train stations, airport runways, even the white dividing lines on \r\nlonely highways and interstates as they disappeared behind my car. My idea of \r\nheaven became a place where we are never again separated from our loved ones. \r\nAnd that puts hell here on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Whispering Night \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nfor George King\r\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\r\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\r\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky,\r\nand the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\r\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\r\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\r\nWe must heave our bodies to some violent ocean\r\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\r\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\r\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly\'s breeze:\r\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\r\nto the world of resplendence from which we were seized. \r\nPublished in Songs of Innocence, \r\nRomantics Quarterly and Poetry Life  Times.
