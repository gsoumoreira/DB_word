However, if you find poems you enjoy \r\nhere, perhaps they can help you grow your own reading list, even if what I produced is really \r\nonly a compilation of my favorite free verse poems. Purists may dispute some of my \r\nchoices, claiming them to be closer to traditional blank verse or accentual \r\nverse than ad hoc free verse, but my goal here is not to draw lines \r\nin the sand or to minutely dissect poems to see what makes them tick. All the \r\npoems here are freer in form than traditional poetic forms such as orthodox sonnets and \r\nvillanelles. So rather than quibble, let\'s just relax and\r\nenjoy some \r\nof the best freer poems written in, or translated into, English ...\r\n\r\ncompiled\r\nby Michael R.

Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot, (#4) Sunday Morning by \r\nWallace Stevens, (#3) The Snowman by Wallace Stevens, (#2) Voyages by Hart \r\nCrane, (#1) Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman (the entire collection)\r\n\r\nA Brief Timeline of Free Verse\r\n\r\nThe history of English free verse probably beginsnot \r\nwith the King James Bible, per sebut with its precursor, the John Wycliffe \r\ntranslation of the Psalms (circa 1380). Written around the same time, Geoffrey \r\nChaucer\'s House of Fame contains an early reference to free (or freer) \r\nverse. Thomas Wyatt, born 1503, was accused of being too \r\nfree with English meter. Henry Howard, born 1516, was the \r\ncreator of unrhymed English blank verse, a precursor of English free verse. \r\nThomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare employed blank verse in \r\ntheir plays (c. 1580-1610). The King James Bible (1604-1611) contains \r\nsome of the oldest and best English free verse. Abraham \r\nCowley\'s Pindarique Odes (1656) may be free \r\nverse. John Milton\'s Samson Agonistes (1671) has been \r\ncalled free verse due to its varying line lengths and irregular rhymes. \r\nChristopher Smart\'s Jubliate Agno (c. 1759) was \r\nprobably modeled after biblical free verse. William Blake\'s Marriage of Heaven and Hell \r\n(c. 1790) modulates what \r\nBlake called the monotonous cadence of English verse (i.e., the metronome). Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass \r\n(1855) around the time Emily Dickinson was telling it slant. Matthew \r\nArnold\'s Dover Beach (1867) feels modern in the way it expresses strong doubts about religious faith, \r\nany sort of certainty, and even man\'s future. What we now call Modernism dawned \r\naround 1912 with the debut of Imagism, the brainchild of Ezra Pound and T. E. \r\nHulme. Another landmark was T. S. Eliot\'s Prufrock and Other \r\nObservations (1917). William Carlos Williams became known for his \r\nRed Wheel Barrow (1923) and the corresponding catchphrase no ideas but in things. \r\nAround the same time e. e. cummings was taking liberties with English \r\ngrammar and punctuation. Langston Hughes\' The Weary Blues (1926) was a fusion of formal verse, free verse, negro spirituals, \r\nblues and jazz. Allen Ginsberg, writing under the influence of Blake and \r\nWhitman, published a sort of ultramodern prophecy in Howl (1956). What cannot be disputed is that when Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass, he became the first major free verse poet of the English language. Pound admitted Whitman was his poetic father \r\nin his poem The Pact. Ginsberg wrote a tribute to Whitman in which he called him dear father. Now no one seems to know exactly what free verse \r\nis, or how to define it, but it is apparently with us to stay. For an expanded \r\ntimeline of free verse, please click here:\r\nFree Verse Timeline.\r\n\r\nMy picks for the ten most influential free verse poets are: Walt Whitman, \r\nEzra Pound, T. S. Eliot, William Blake, Emily Dickinson, e. e. cummings, William \r\nCarlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Langston Hughes and Wallace Stevens.\r\n\r\nFree Verse  \r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos is perhaps the first great female poet still known to us today, \r\nand she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. \r\nShe is so revered for her erotic love poetry that we get our terms sapphic and lesbian from her name \r\nand island of residence. While Sappho did not write free verse herself, many of her \r\ntranslators have used free verse to bring us her work in English. And, as you can see from the stellar epigram \r\nbelow, she remains a timeless treasure:\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nIf you like my translation you\'re welcome to share it, but please credit Sappho \r\nas the original poet and Michael R. Burch as the translator. You can do that by \r\ncopying the title with the poem. \r\n\r\nI find it interesting that ancient Greek epigrams like those of Sappho feel \r\nvery similar to haiku by ancient oriental masters like Basho. Here\'s my free \r\nverse translation of a haiku by Basho, for comparison:\r\n\r\nMatsuo Basho \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe first soft snow:\r\n\tleaves of the awed jonquil\r\nbow low.\r\n\r\nYou are also welcome to share this translation if you like it, but if you do, \r\nplease credit Matsuo Basho as the original poet and Michael R. Burch as the \r\ntranslator. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite poem by Walt Whitman, the father of English \r\nfree verse and probably the most original and unique American poet. A Noiseless, \r\nPatient Spider demonstrates how a \r\ngreat poem can mesmerize us with a simple metaphor: here, a spider \r\nweaving its web symbolizes the ever-questing and -questioning human soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson and Walt Whitman were the mother and father of American free \r\nverse, but they were as unalike as \r\nnight and day. Whitman claimed to be a rogue and wrote freely about sex and \r\nhomosexuality. Dickinson was a recluse who wrote about love more circumspectly. \r\nBut perhaps they were not so unalike, since it has been suggested that they both \r\nwrote about love without ever consummating a real-life relationship. In any \r\ncase, they left us many moving and memorable poems. Dickinson\'s poems seem more \r\nformal/traditional that Whitman\'s, but she employed slant rhymes and metrical \r\nvariations that make her sound different from any \r\npoet before her ...\r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nLips unused to thee.\r\nBashful, sip thy jasmines,\r\nAs the fainting bee,\r\n\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums,\r\nCounts his nectarsalights,\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\nIf Walt Whitman is the father of free verse, Ezra Pound is the rebellious son \r\nwho helped carry on the family tradition despite not always agreeing with (or \r\nwanting to acknowledge) his patriarch. Pound is an interesting poet. He advised other poets to make it new, then wrote some of the most \r\narchaic-sounding poems since Chaucer. But he proved in poems like The Garden \r\nthat free verse can rival the best formal poetry.\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth. \r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile modern English/American free verse began with Walt Whitman, he obviously learned \r\n\tmuch about his craft from the King James Bible. The KJV, produced \r\nfrom 1604 to 1611 under the sponsorship of King James I of England, contains \r\nsome of the best and most ancient free verse in the English language. The passage below demonstrates \r\njust how moving and musical poetry can be, without formal meter or rhyme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of Solomon\r\nattributed to King Solomon\r\nfrom the King James Bible\r\n\r\nI am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\nAs the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\nAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.\r\nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\nHe brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.\r\nStay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.\r\nHis left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.\r\nI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,\r\nand by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer is perhaps the first great poem in the English language, \r\nwith the caveat that at the time it was written, English still sounded a lot like \r\n\tGerman! I hope my translation of the poem does it\r\njustice, because it has been one of my favorite poems since I first read it. The \r\npoem seems to have been written by a woman \r\n\tand it deals with what appears to be rape, an \r\nunwanted child, and perhaps a m\xe9nage a trois. \r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer\r\n(Anonymous Anglo-Saxon Ballad, circa 960 AD)\r\nloose translation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game; \r\nthey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens. \r\n\t(fastened=secured)\r\n\tHere, bloodthirsty curs howl for carnage.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nMy heart pursued Wulf like a panting hound,\r\n\tbut whenever it rainedhow I \r\n\twept!\r\n\tthe boldest cur grasped me in his paws:\r\ngood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\n\t\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\n\t\r\nHave you heard, Eadwacer? Watchdog! A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods!\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\t\r\n\t\r\n\tNOTE: I do not claim that my interpretation of this famously ambiguous \r\n\tpoem is the correct one. In my poem, the speaker is a defiant early \r\n\tfeminist, the first #metoo poet of the English language. She is disgusted with her bloodthirsty tribe, who have driven her \r\n\tlover Wulf away. Why? Perhaps because they wanted to sacrifice him to the \r\n\tgods. Perhaps because he broke some primitive law. We simply don\'t know. \r\n\tBut whatever the reason, the speaker claims that \r\n\tit is ungelic, or otherwise with her. She is not like her \r\n\tferocious, bloodthirsty people. They are alien to her. Rather, she dreams of \r\n\ther lover Wulf and follows him in her hopeful, loving thoughts. But even as \r\n\tshe dreams of Wulf, she is being raped by another man, Eadwacer. It is not \r\n\tclear who Eadwacer is. He may be a priest (Heaven-Watcher), a guardian \r\n\t(Property-Watcher), a family member appointed to protect her purity (a \r\n\tWatchdog), or perhaps her husband against her will. The speaker defiantly insults Eadwacer. \r\n\tHe is unable to please her. He is deficient in meat compared to Wulf. \r\nShe mocks her would-be lover and protector. Eadwacer has made her pregnant, \r\nbut she abhors him. Something terrible has happened to their whelp, or child. \r\nTheir song together will be easily severed, because they were never really \r\none. She waits for Wulf to put an end to Eadwacer, so that they can be reunited.\r\n\tAgain, please keep in mind that I cannot claim that this is the correct \r\n\tinterpretation of the poem. No one can claim to know exactly what the original poet \r\n\tintended. But I think my interpretation makes sense. It\'s the story of many \r\n\twomen who have been separated from the men they love by war, religion and/or \r\n\tchauvinistic men. \r\n\r\nThe earliest Old English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn, \r\nwhich was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the scholar \r\nBede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who worked at the monastery of \r\nWhitby, a small English fishing village on the North Sea. C\xe6dmon, as Bede\'s \r\nstory goes, was given the gift of poetic composition by an angel. Like Wulf and \r\nEadwacer, C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn was written in accentual meter, which utilizes four \r\nstrong beats per line and alliteration to create word music.\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn (circa 658-680 AD)\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHumbly let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe Measurer\'s might  and his mind-plans,\r\nthe goals of the Glory-Father.First he, the Everlasting Lord,\r\nestablished earth\'s fearful foundations.\r\nThen he, the First Scop, hoisted heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men: Holy Creator,\r\nmankind\'s great Maker! Then he, the Ever-Living Lord, \r\nafterwards made men middle-earth: Master Almighty!\r\n\r\nThe poem below, by Ezra Pound, strikes me as a free verse Haiku. This short \r\npoem demonstrates the ability of the better poets to capture a moment, in a few \r\nwords, for all time. \r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition \r\n  of these faces  in the\r\n  crowd:\r\nPetals  on a wet,\r\n  black  bough.\r\n\r\nAllen Ginsburg was perhaps Walt Whitman\'s primary heir. In this poem, Ginsburg \r\ncaptures the questing spirit of Whitman, the way Whitman once captured the \r\nquesting spirit of a noiseless patient spider. \r\n\r\nA Supermarket in California\r\nby Allen Ginsberg\r\n\r\nWhat thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, \r\nfor I walked down the\r\nstreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious \r\nlooking at the full moon.\r\nIn my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I \r\nwent into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!\r\nWhat peaches and what penumbras! Whole families \r\nshopping at night! Aisles\r\nfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the \r\ntomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the \r\nwatermelons?\r\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old \r\ngrubber, poking among the\r\nmeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the \r\npork chops? What price\r\nbananas? Are you my Angel?\r\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of \r\ncans following you, and\r\nfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our \r\nsolitary fancy tasting\r\nartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never \r\npassing the cashier.\r\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in \r\nan hour. Which way does\r\nyour beard point tonight?\r\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the \r\nsupermarket and feel\r\nabsurd.)\r\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The \r\ntrees add shade to\r\nshade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love \r\npast blue automobiles in\r\ndriveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old \r\ncourage-teacher, what America did you\r\nhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out \r\non a smoking bank and\r\nstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of \r\nLethe?\r\n\n\nCarl Sandburg is one of America\'s best-known penners of free verse. \nHere grass may refer to Walt Whitman\'s Leaves of Grass, in which the \nfirst American free verse poet suggests that if we want to find him after his \ndeath, we can look for him under our boot soles. While this is not \na poem about the Holocaust, per se, every time I read it, I am reminded of the \nmass graves discovered by Allied troops as they freed Europe from the Nazis. \nAlso, the similarity in sound of Austerlitz to Auschwitz creates an aural \nlink of sorts. \n\nGrass\n\nby Carl Sandburg\n\n\nPile the bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. \nShovel them under and let me work\nI am the grass; I cover all.\n\nAnd pile them high at Gettysburg\nAnd pile them high at Ypres and Verdun.\nShovel them under and let me work.\nTwo years, ten years, and the passengers ask the conductor:\nWhat place is this?\nWhere are we now?\n\nI am the grass.\nLet me work. \nUnder the Harvest Moon\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\nUnder the harvest moon,\r\nWhen the soft silver\r\nDrips shimmering\r\nOver the garden nights,\r\nDeath, the gray mocker,\r\nComes and whispers to you\r\nAs a beautiful friend\r\nWho remembers.\r\n\r\nUnder the summer roses\r\nWhen the flagrant crimson\r\nLurks in the dusk\r\nOf the wild red leaves,\r\nLove, with little hands,\r\nComes and touches you\r\nWith a thousand memories,\r\nAnd asks you\r\nBeautiful, unanswerable questions.\r\n\r\nDover Beach, written around 1850 and published in 1867, has been called the \r\nfirst major free-verse poem in the language. I tend to agree, as Dover Beach \r\nand T. S. Eliot\'s The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock strike me as the first \r\ntwo great modern free verse poems in the English language, out of the poems that \r\ncontinue to employ meter and rhyme in a more relaxed form, while the best poems \r\nof Walt Whitman make a more complete break. Arnold\'s and Eliot\'s poems also seem \r\nmore modern, while Whitman\'s sound more like the King James Bible. But I love \r\nthe best work of all three poets, so once again I don\'t want to split hairs. \r\nIt\'s interesting to compare the different styles that began to emerge from the \r\nmid 1800\'s to early 1900\'s, but there is no more need to choose between formal \r\npoetry and free verse than there is to choose between classical music and jazz.\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays is a poem that is simultaneously a blank verse sonnet and \r\nfree verse. Rather than trying to label it, we should simply enjoy it, as it \r\ntells a compelling story about a boy who once took his father for granted, until \r\none day he saw the light.\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nStephen Crane was one of the more distinctive early adopters of free verse. \r\nToday he is best known for his novel The Red Badge of Courage and short \r\nstories like The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky. But he was an accomplished \r\npoet at an early age. Many of his poems, including the two below, fall into the \r\neclectic category of free verse parables. At the time Crane was \r\nwriting, no other poet sounded like him, although other writers would later adopt his \r\nterse, no-nonsense style. Although he died prematurely at age 28, Crane became \r\nan influence on the early Modernists and writers like Ernest Hemingway. Crane \r\nrejected sentimentality and said: A story should be logical in its action and \r\nfaithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest \r\nartists were the simplest, and simple because they were true. We can also find \r\nthe virtues of truthfulness and simplicity in his poems. \r\n\r\nFast rode the knight\r\nby Stephen Crane\r\n\r\nFast rode the knight\r\nWith spurs, hot and reeking,\r\nEver waving an eager sword,\r\nTo save my lady!\r\nFast rode the knight,\r\nAnd leaped from saddle to war.\r\nMen of steel flickered and gleamed\r\nLike riot of silver lights,\r\nAnd the gold of the knight\'s good banner\r\nStill waved on a castle wall.\r\n. . .\r\nA horse,\r\nBlowing, staggering, bloody thing,\r\nForgotten at foot of castle wall.\r\nA horse\r\nDead at foot of castle wall.\r\n\r\nThe Wayfarer\r\nby Stephen Crane\r\n\r\nTHE WAYFARER,\r\nPerceiving the pathway to truth,\r\nWas struck with astonishment.\r\nIt was thickly grown with weeds.\r\nHa, he said,\r\nI see that none has passed here\r\nIn a long time.\r\nLater he saw that each weed\r\nWas a singular knife.\r\nWell, he mumbled at last,\r\nDoubtless there are other roads.\r\n\r\nRobert Creeley is a modern poet who wrote in a spare style similar to that of \r\nStephen Crane. Creeley is often associated with the Black Mountain poets, a \r\ngroup that included Charles Olson, Robert Duncan and Allen Ginsberg, among \r\nothers. Creeley was a prolific writer, with more than sixty published books. \r\n\r\nI Know a Man\r\nby Robert Creeley\r\n\r\nAs I sd to my\r\nfriend, because I am\r\nalways talking  John, I\r\n\r\nsd, which was not his\r\nname, the darkness sur-\r\nrounds us, what\r\n\r\ncan we do against\r\nit, or else, shall we \r\nwhy not, buy a goddamn big car,\r\n\r\ndrive, he sd, for\r\nchrists sake, look\r\nout where yr going.\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens is one of the best modern free verse poets, although many of his \r\nbest poems are written in what appears to be gorgeously-rhythmed blank verse \r\n(i.e., unrhymed iambic pentameter). His meter is so good it defies \r\ncategorization; perhaps only Hart Crane rivals him when it comes to writing fluid verse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man  \r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is another poet who\'s difficult to categorize. Piano may be \r\nthe best and most musical of his poems. While most of his best-known poems are \r\ndecidedly free verse, this one is written in rhymed couplets and seems more \r\ntraditional, yet in a nicely relaxed, modern way.\r\n\r\nPiano  \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nRobinson Jeffers preferred nature to human civilizations, which he seemed to \r\nfind not all that civilized. Jeffers built a rough-hewn stone tower on the \r\nCalifornia coast, where he lived in relative solitude with his wife Una and \r\ntheir family. The four-story Gothic tower was named Hawk Tower after a hawk \r\nthat appeared while Jeffers was working on the structure, and which disappeared \r\nthe day it was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGwendolyn Brooks was the first African-American writer to receive a Pulitzer \r\nPrize. Her poems often dealt with the personal celebrations and struggles of \r\nordinary people in her community. \r\n\r\nThe Bean Eaters\r\nby Gwendolyn Brooks\r\n\r\nThey eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair.\r\nDinner is a casual affair.\r\nPlain chipware on a plain and creaking wood.\r\nTin flatware.\r\n\r\nTwo who are Mostly Good.\r\nTwo who have lived their day,\r\nBut keep putting on their clothes\r\nAnd putting things away.\r\n\r\nAnd remembering...\r\nRemembering, with twinklings and twinges\r\nAs they lean over the beans in their rented back room that is full of beads and \r\nreceipts and dolls and clothes, tobacco crumbs, vases and fringes.\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\r\n\r\nAlong with Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot helped create modern free verse. This poem \r\ndemonstrates his remarkable talents. While Eliot was a sophisticated, urbane \r\npoet, his main theme was human love, and he often comes across as a somewhat \r\nnerdy, disillusioned romantic. \r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nWilliam Carlos Williams is one of the most important American free verse poets, \r\nalong with Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot.\r\n\r\nThis Is Just To Say\r\nby William Carlos Williams\r\nI have eaten\r\nthe plums\r\nthat were in\r\nthe icebox\r\nand which\r\nyou were probably\r\nsaving\r\nfor breakfast\r\nForgive me\r\nthey were delicious\r\nso sweet\r\nand so cold\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes is another important and highly influential\r\nAmerican free verse poet. He was also important as a protest poet. His \r\npoetry contains elements of traditional poetry, negro spirituals and the blues.\r\n\r\nI, Too, Sing America\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\nI, too, sing America.\r\nI am the darker brother.\r\nThey send me to eat in the kitchen\r\nWhen company comes,\r\nBut I laugh,\r\nAnd eat well,\r\nAnd grow strong.\r\nTomorrow,\r\nI\'ll be at the table\r\nWhen company comes.\r\nNobody\'ll dare\r\nSay to me,\r\nEat in the kitchen,\r\nThen.\r\nBesides,\r\nThey\'ll see how beautiful I am\r\nAnd be ashamed\r\nI, too, am America.\r\n\r\nLuis Omar Salinas is generally considered to be one of the best Hispanic \r\npoets to write in English, with good cause. Sometimes Mysteriously is one of \r\nthose mysterious poems that makes us feel a special kinship with the \r\npoet. \r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers. \r\n\r\nSometimes Mysteriously\r\n\r\nby Luis Omar Salinas\r\n\r\nSometimes in the evening when love\r\ntunes its harp and the crickets\r\ncelebrate life, I am like a troubadour\r\nin search of friends, loved ones,\r\nanyone who will share with me\r\na bit of conversation. My loneliness\r\narrives ghostlike and pretentious,\r\nit seeks my soul, it is ravenous\r\nand hurting. I admire my father\r\nwho always has advice in these matters,\r\nbut a game of chess won\'t do, or\r\nthe frivolity of religion.\r\nI want to find a solution, so I\r\nwrite letters, poems, and sometimes\r\nI touch solitude on the shoulder\r\nand surrender to a great tranquility.\r\nI understand I need courage\r\nand sometimes, mysteriously,\r\nI feel whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following poem by Robinson Jeffers reminds me of Robert Oppenheimer\'s \r\ncomparison of the atomic bomb to Shiva: I am become Death, the destroyer of \r\nworlds. \r\n\r\nShiva\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nThere is a hawk that is picking the birds out of our sky,\r\nShe killed the pigeons of peace and security,\r\nShe has taken honesty and confidence from nations and men,\r\nShe is hunting the lonely heron of liberty.\r\nShe loads the arts with nonsense, she is very cunning,\r\nScience with dreams and the state with powers to catch them at last.\r\nNothing will escape her at last, flying nor running.\r\nThis is the hawk that picks out the star\'s eyes.\r\nThis is the only hunter that will ever catch the wild swan;\r\nThe prey she will take last is the wild white swan of the beauty of things.\r\nThen she will be alone, pure destruction, achieved and supreme,\r\nEmpty darkness under the death-tent wings.\r\nShe will build a nest of the swan\'s bones and hatch a new brood,\r\nHang new heavens with new birds, all be renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalid Khazindar was born in 1950 in Gaza City. He is considered one of the best Palestinian poets; his poetry has been said to \r\nbe characterized by metaphoric originality and a novel thematic approach \r\nunprecedented in Arabic poetry. He was awarded the first Palestine Prize for \r\nPoetry in 1997. He lives in Tunis.\r\n\r\nDistant light\r\n\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBitterly cold,\r\nwinter clings to the naked trees.\r\nIf only you would free \r\nthe bright sparrows\r\nfrom the tips of your fingers\r\nand release a smilethat shy, tentative smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned anguish I see.\r\nSing! Can we not sing\r\nas if we were warm, hand-in-hand,\r\nshielded by shade from a glaring sun?\r\nCan you not always remain this way,\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than necessary, and \r\nsilent?\r\nDarkness increases; we must remain vigilant\r\nand this distant light is our only consolation\r\nthis imperiled flame, which from the beginning\r\nhas been flickering,\r\nin danger of going out.\r\nCome to me, closer and closer.\r\nI dont want to be able to tell my hand from yours.\r\nAnd lets stay awake, lest the snow smother us.\r\n\r\nA Blessing is a wonderfully touching praise poem that helps us share the \r\npoet\'s awe and gladness to have had such a magical experience with creatures of \r\nanother species. I like to think of poetry being an act of communion between the \r\npoet and reader, and this poem might well be called sacred, or touching on the \r\nsacred. \r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\nThe Layers is one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. Stanley Kunitz (1905-2006) was an American poet. He was \r\nappointed Poet Laureate twice, first in 1974 and then again in 2000 (when he was 95!).\r\n\r\nThe Layers\r\nby Stanley Kunitz\r\n\r\nI have walked through many lives,\r\nsome of them my own,\r\nand I am not who I was,\r\nthough some principle of being\r\nabides, from which I struggle\r\nnot to stray.\r\nWhen I look behind,\r\nas I am compelled to look\r\nbefore I can gather strength\r\nto proceed on my journey,\r\nI see the milestones dwindling\r\ntoward the horizon\r\nand the slow fires trailing\r\nfrom the abandoned camp-sites,\r\nover which scavenger angels\r\nwheel on heavy wings.\r\nOh, I have made myself a tribe\r\nout of my true affections,\r\nand my tribe is scattered!\r\nHow shall the heart be reconciled\r\nto its feast of losses?\r\nIn a rising wind\r\nthe manic dust of my friends,\r\nthose who fell along the way,\r\nbitterly stings my face.\r\nYet I turn, I turn,\r\nexulting somewhat,\r\nwith my will intact to go\r\nwherever I need to go,\r\nand every stone on the road\r\nprecious to me.\r\nIn my darkest night,\r\nwhen the moon was covered\r\nand I roamed through wreckage,\r\na nimbus-clouded voice\r\ndirected me:\r\nLive in the layers,\r\nnot on the litter.\r\nThough I lack the art\r\nto decipher it,\r\nno doubt the next chapter\r\nin my book of transformations\r\nis already written.\r\nI am not done with my changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nin Just- by e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nin Just-\r\nspring when the\r\nworld is mud-\r\nluscious the little\r\nlame baloonman\r\n\r\nwhistles far and wee\r\n\r\nand eddieandbill come\r\nrunning from marbles and\r\npiracies and it\'s\r\nspring\r\n\r\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\r\n\r\nthe queer\r\nold baloonman whistles\r\nfar and wee\r\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\r\n\r\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\r\nit\'s\r\nspring\r\nand\r\n\r\n the\r\ngoat-footed\r\n\r\nbaloonMan whistles\r\nfar\r\nand\r\nwee\r\n\r\nBeginning My Studies \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\'d me so much,\r\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\r\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\r\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\'d me so much,\r\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\'d to go any farther,\r\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive \r\npigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Moore is one of my favorite contemporary poets. He specialized \r\nin writing formal poetry, and was a strong proponent of perfect rhyme. But he \r\nstill managed to write one of my favorite free verse poems, In the Dark \r\nSeason. \r\n\r\nIn The Dark Season\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI fall out of the foliage of my feelings.\r\nThat is the beginning, the ending,\r\nwhen the orange peels appear\r\nfrom the shrinking lips of the snow\r\nand broken bottles, still clinging to their labels,\r\nin the gutter outside the church.\r\nA silk stocking coils in the mud.\r\nIn the dark season, someone has sown\r\nthe seed of confusion. The church will graze\r\non the flowers, the fruits of love,\r\nthe soft nutritious pulp of remorse.\r\nDo these events signify\r\nsummertime in another hemisphere?\r\nOne studied a new language in the darkness,\r\nlooked far down into the well,\r\ninto the hints of sunlight in its depths.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe are dead such a long time before\r\nand will be dead such a long time after\r\nthis leaping into light\r\nas a dolphin leaps from the sea\r\nand carries the glare of that moment\r\nback among the curious creatures\r\nwho have not known the light.\r\nDon\'t tell me this is like Plato\'s cave;\r\nI know that. But in death, our element,\r\nwho swims with us? Do we even?\r\nIf God is light...No, but there may be,\r\nas the poet says, a soft monster\r\ndeeply sleeping among his thousand\r\narms under millennia\r\nunnumbered, and enormous polypi.\r\nI think we have been frightened into life\r\nas fish leap from greater fish below.\r\nWe cry angrily in our cradles,\r\nthen overcome, grow tranquil through the years,\r\nhopefully, ready ever for the depths\r\never ready for us.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nYes, but of course, there is the need\r\nfor symmetry. Matter calls out\r\nfor antimatter, which forthwith\r\nsings in the shadows. Thus, tonight\r\nstreetlight fingers new foliage\r\nwith breezes making light of it,\r\nwhere unseen trunk divides itself\r\ninto a multitude of tips\r\nabove ground and below, as in\r\na mirror, strangers to each other,\r\ntwo lives, depending on each other,\r\ntherefore the same life: in dark depth\r\nand moisture one, in dry sunlight\r\nthe other: God and Satan, one,\r\nfemale and male in each one, one.\r\nDolphins from darkness visit light.\r\nWho from her glitter visits us?\r\nThese, lost inside you: look outside\r\nin the not-you: you find them there.\r\n\r\nFinal Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nLight the first light of evening, as in a room\r\nIn which we rest and, for small reason, think\r\nThe world imagined is the ultimate good.\r\n\r\nThis is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. \r\nIt is in that thought that we collect ourselves,\r\nOut of all the indifferences, into one thing:\r\n\r\nWithin a single thing, a single shawl\r\nWrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, \r\nA light, a power, the miraculous influence.\r\n\r\nHere, now, we forget each other and ourselves.\r\nWe feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, \r\nA knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nWithin its vital boundary, in the mind.\r\nWe say God and the imagination are one ... \r\nHow high that highest candle lights the dark.\r\n\r\nOut of this same light, out of the central mind, \r\nWe make a dwelling in the evening air, \r\nIn which being there together is enough.\r\nHurt Hawks\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nThe broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,\r\nThe wing trails like a banner in defeat,\r\nNo more to use the sky forever but live with famine\r\nAnd pain a few days: cat nor coyote\r\nWill shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.\r\nHe stands under the oak-bush and waits\r\nThe lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom\r\nAnd flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it.\r\nHe is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.\r\nThe curs of the day come and torment him\r\nAt distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head,\r\nThe intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.\r\nThe wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those\r\nThat ask mercy, not often to the arrogant.\r\nYou do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him;\r\nIntemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;\r\nBeautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.\r\n\r\nId sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtail\r\nHad nothing left but unable misery\r\nFrom the bones too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons \r\nwhen he moved.\r\nWe had fed him for six weeks, I gave him freedom,\r\nHe wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for \r\ndeath,\r\nNot like a beggar, still eyed with the old\r\nImplacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was \r\nrelaxed,\r\nOwl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what\r\nSoared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its \r\nrising\r\nBefore it was quite unsheathed from reality.\r\n\r\nEdge\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe woman is perfected.\r\nHer dead\r\nBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\r\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\r\nFlows in the scrolls of her toga,\r\nHer bare\r\nFeet seem to be saying:\r\nWe have come so far, it is over.\r\nEach dead child coiled, a white serpent,\r\nOne at each little\r\nPitcher of milk, now empty.\r\nShe has folded\r\nThem back into her body as petals\r\nOf a rose close when the garden\r\nStiffens and odors bleed\r\nFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.\r\nThe moon has nothing to be sad about,\r\nStaring from her hood of bone.\r\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\r\nHer blacks crackle and drag.\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers. Dont cry\r\nthe best gesture of my brain is less than\r\nyour eyelids flutter which says\r\n\r\nwe are for each other: then\r\nlaugh, leaning back in my arms\r\nfor lifes not a paragraph\r\n\r\nAnd death i think is no parenthesis\r\n\r\nWinter in the Boulevard\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nThe frost has settled down upon the trees\r\nAnd ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies\r\nOf leaves that have gone unnoticed, swept like old\r\nRomantic stories now no more to be told.\r\nThe trees down the boulevard stand naked in thought,\r\nTheir abundant summery wordage silenced, caught\r\nIn the grim undertow; naked the trees confront\r\nImplacable winter\'s long, cross-questioning brunt.\r\nHas some hand balanced more leaves in the depths of the twigs?\r\nSome dim little efforts placed in the threads of the birch?\r\nIt is only the sparrows, like dead black leaves on the sprigs,\r\nSitting huddled against the cerulean, one flesh with their perch.\r\nThe clear, cold sky coldly bethinks itself.\r\nLike vivid thought the air spins bright, and all\r\nTrees, birds, and earth, arrested in the after-thought\r\nAwaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought.\r\n\r\nChoricos\r\nby Richard Aldington\r\n\r\nThe ancient songs \r\nPass deathward mournfully.\r\n\r\nCold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,\r\nRegretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings\r\nSymbols of ancient songs\r\nMournfully passing\r\nDown to the great white surges,\r\nWatched of none\r\nSave the frail sea-birds\r\nAnd the lithe pale girls,\r\nDaughters of Okeanos.\r\n\r\nAnd the songs pass\r\nFrom the green land\r\nWhich lies upon the waves as a leaf \r\nOn the flowers of hyacinth;\r\nAnd they pass from the waters,\r\nThe manifold winds and the dim moon,\r\nAnd they come,\r\nSilently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,\r\nTo the quiet level lands\r\nThat she keeps for us all,\r\nThat she wrought for us all for sleep\r\nIn the silver days of the earths dawning\r\nProsperine, daughter of Zeus. \r\n\r\nAnd we turn from the Kuprians breasts, \r\nAnd we turn from thee,\r\nPhoibos Apollon,\r\nAnd we turn from the music of old\r\nAnd the hills that we loved and the meads,\r\nAnd we turn from the fiery day,\r\nAnd the lips that were over-sweet;\r\nFor silently\r\nBrushing the fields with red-shod feet,\r\nWith purple robe\r\nSearing the flowers as with a sudden flame,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou hast come upon us. \r\n\r\nAnd of all the ancient songs\r\nPassing to the swallow-blue halls\r\nBy the dark streams of Persephone,\r\nThis only remains:\r\nThat in the end we turn to thee,\r\nDeath,\r\nThat we turn to thee, singing \r\nOne last song.\r\n\r\nO Death,\r\nThou art an healing wind\r\nThat blowest over white flowers\r\nA-tremble with dew;\r\nThou art a wind flowing\r\nOver long leagues of lonely sea;\r\nThou art the dusk and the fragrance;\r\nThou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;\r\nThou art the pale peace of one\r\nSatiate with old desires;\r\nThou art the silence of beauty,\r\nAnd we look no more for the morning;\r\nWe yearn no more for the sun, \r\nSince with thy white hands,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,\r\nThe slim colorless poppies\r\nWhich in thy garden alone\r\nSoftly thou gatherest.\r\n\r\nAnd silently;\r\nAnd with slow feet approaching;\r\nAnd with bowed head and unlit eyes, \r\nWe kneel before thee.\r\nAnd thou, leaning towards us, \r\nCaressingly layest upon us\r\nFlowers from thy thin cold hands,\r\nAnd, smiling as a chaste woman\r\nKnowing love in her heart,\r\nThou sealest our eyes\r\nAnd the illimitable quietude\r\nComes gently upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther free verse poems of note:\r\n\r\nSong of Myself by Walt Whitman\r\nOut of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking Rocking by Walt Whitman\r\nWhen Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\'d by Walt Whitman\r\nThe Love Song of J.
