Thus story poems can \r\nalso be \r\ncalled narrative poems. When story poems are about important events and/or \r\nheroic actions, and are of considerable length, they are called epic poems. \r\nLyric poems can also tell stories, but are usually much shorter. For instance, \r\nthe sonnet Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelly tells a compelling story \r\nin fourteen lines but doesn\'t have the breadth and detail of an epic poem like \r\nthe Odyssey or Iliad. A haiku might tell a very brief story, \r\nleaving out most of the details, using only 17 \r\nsyllables, or thereabouts. \r\n\r\nThe types or sub-genres of narrative poetryinclude epics, verse novels, \r\nballads, romances, idylls, and lays.\r\n\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA Timeline of the Top Ten Epic Poems (*) \r\n\r\nNote: When an exact date of composition is unknown, the author\'s \r\nbirthdate, if known or guessable, has sometimes been used. The older the date, \r\nthe less likely it is to be precise. All dates are AD unless specifically \r\ndenoted BC. My picks for the top ten epics are marked with asterisks. \r\n\r\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh circa 2000 BC (*)\r\nThe Odyssey by Homer circa 1000 BC (*)\r\nThe Iliad by Homer circa 1000 BC (*)\r\nThe Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita by Veda Vyasa circa 500 BC\r\nThe Aeneid by Virgil circa 70 BC (*)\r\nMetamorphoses by Ovid circa 40 BC\r\nThe Shahnameh (The Persian Book of Kings) by Firdawsicirca 940\r\nBeowulf circa 1000 (*)\r\nChanson de Roland  (The Song of Roland) circa 1100 (*)\r\nRoman de la Rose by Guillaume de Lorris circa 1230\r\nThe Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri circa 1265 (*)\r\nTroilus and Criseyde by Geoffrey Chaucer circa 1385 (*)\r\nThe Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser circa 1590 (*)\r\nParadise Lost by John Milton circa 1658 (*)\r\nParadise Regained by John Milton circa 1671\r\nThe Rape of the Lock by Alexander Pope circa 1714\r\nFaust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe circa 1808\r\nChilde Harold\'s Pilgrimage by Lord Byron circa 1810\r\nDon Juan by Lord Byron circa 1818\r\nThe Cantos by Ezra Pound circa 1915\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable mention: The Book of Job, El Cid, \r\nGawain and the Green Knight, The Shahnameh (The Book of Kings), The Nibelungenlied (The Saga of Siegfried), \r\nThe Icelandic Sagas,Orlando Furioso, \r\nThe Lusiads, Epic of Manas, The Saga of King Gesar, The \r\nRamayana, The Raghuvamsa, T\xe1in B\xf3 C\xfaailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), Queen \r\nMab, Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Endymion, Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, \r\nPrometheus Bound, Evangeline, The Song of Hiawatha, Aurora Leigh, Idylls of the \r\nKing, The Wanderings of Oisin, The Bridge, Patterson, Omeros, Helvellyn \r\n\r\nOther Noteworthy Longer Story Poems: The Dream Visions\r\n\r\nAn ancient dream vision was Cicero\'sSomnium Scipionis(The \r\nDream of Scipio) composed circa 50 BC. Chaucer mentioned Cicero in his \r\nParliament of Foules.\r\nThe Consolation of Philosophyby the 6th-century Roman philosopher Boethius \r\nalso influenced later dream visions. Chaucer translated it, as did King Alfred \r\nthe Great.\r\nThe Dream of the Rood has been dated to the 8th century or no later \r\nthan the 10th, making it one of the oldest extant poems in the English language.\r\nLe Roman de la Rose (The Romance of the Rose), circa 1230, is a long \r\nallegorical dream vision and notable example of medieval French courtly \r\nliterature. \r\nWynnere and Wastoure is an English dream vision poem believed to have \r\nbeen composed circa 1350 by an unknown poet. \r\nGeoffrey Chaucer\'s Parliament of Foules, circa 1380, is an early \r\nexample of an English dream vision poem by a known poet.\r\nThe Book of the Duchess, circa 1368, andThe House of Fame, \r\ncirca 1379, are Chaucer\'s other surviving dream vision poems.\r\nWilliam Langland\'s Piers Plowman is an English dream vision poem \r\ncomposed around the same time as Chaucer\'s.\r\nPearl is another English dream vision poem believed to have been \r\nwritten around this time, by an unknown poet. \r\nJohn Gower\'sConfessio Amantis(The Lover\'s Confession), circa 1390, \r\nuses the dream vision as a vehicle for consolation. \r\n\r\nTop Ten Story Poems\r\nTop Ten Narrative Poems\r\n\r\nPaul Revere\'s Ride by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and The Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (tie)\r\nThe Pied Piper of Hamelin by Robert Browning\r\nThe Raven by Edgar Alan Poe \r\nThe Fish by Elizabeth Bishop\r\nThe Listeners by Walter de la Mare\r\nOzymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\nThe Ballad of Sir Patrick Spens by Anonymous\r\nWulf and Eadwacer by Anonymous \r\nThe Highwayman by Alfred Noyes\r\nHamlet, King Lear, Othello and Macbeth by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon ballad, circa 990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey will rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf is on one island; I, on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, surrounded by fens.\r\nHere bloodthirsty men howl, lusting for sacrifice.\r\nThey will rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like wide-ranging hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nhuge, battle-strong arms grabbed and enclosed me.\r\nThat felt good, to a point, but its end was loathsome.\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s Notes: This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a \r\nwild lament, a lover\'s lament, a passion play, a riddle, a song, or an early \r\nballad. However, most scholars place it within the genre of the frauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\nextant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage; it seems likely that the poet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of \r\nancient scops pretending to be women. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called \r\nthe first English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and \r\nmocking the man who has been raping and impregnating her. And the poem\'s closing \r\nmetaphor of a loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never \r\nharmonized remains one of the strongest in the English language, or any \r\nlanguage.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Highwayman \r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\n\r\nThis excellent BBC enactment of The Highwayman runs 9 1/2 minutes and \r\nfeatures Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisborne and Lucy Griffiths as Marian of \r\nKnighton. The poem is sung quite wonderfully by Loorena McKennitt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\nThe Writer\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\nIn her room at the prow of the house\r\nWhere light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,\r\nMy daughter is writing a story.\r\n\r\nI pause in the stairwell, hearing\r\nFrom her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys\r\nLike a chain hauled over a gunwale.\r\n\r\nYoung as she is, the stuff\r\nOf her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:\r\nI wish her a lucky passage.\r\n\r\nBut now it is she who pauses,\r\nAs if to reject my thought and its easy figure.\r\nA stillness greatens, in which\r\n\r\nThe whole house seems to be thinking,\r\nAnd then she is at it again with a bunched clamor\r\nOf strokes, and again is silent.\r\n\r\nI remember the dazed starling\r\nWhich was trapped in that very room, two years ago;\r\nHow we stole in, lifted a sash\r\n\r\nAnd retreated, not to affright it;\r\nAnd how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,\r\nWe watched the sleek, wild, dark\r\n\r\nAnd iridescent creature\r\nBatter against the brilliance, drop like a glove\r\nTo the hard floor, or the desk-top,\r\n\r\nAnd wait then, humped and bloody,\r\nFor the wits to try it again; and how our spirits\r\nRose when, suddenly sure,\r\n\r\nIt lifted off from a chair-back,\r\nBeating a smooth course for the right window\r\nAnd clearing the sill of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is always a matter, my darling,\r\nOf life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish\r\nWhat I wished you before, but harder.\r\n\r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\r\nBut as for me, alas!, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame.\r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. In May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly \r\ncommitting adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released from the Tower later that \r\nyear, thanks to his friendship and his father\'s friendship with Thomas Cromwell. But during his stay in the Tower, \r\nWyatt may have \r\nwitnessed the execution of Anne Boleyn from his cell window, and the executions of the five other men with whom she was accused of committing \r\nadultery. A common interpretation of this poem is that the deer (dear) is Anne \r\nBoleyn, and that Caesar is King Henry VIII, who had her and her lovers beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\n\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fish\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nI caught a tremendous fish\r\nand held him beside the boat\r\nhalf out of water, with my hook\r\nfast in a corner of his mouth.\r\nHe didn\'t fight.\r\nHe hadn\'t fought at all.\r\nHe hung a grunting weight,\r\nbattered and venerable\r\nand homely. Here and there\r\nhis brown skin hung in strips\r\nlike ancient wallpaper,\r\nand its pattern of darker brown\r\nwas like wallpaper:\r\nshapes like full-blown roses\r\nstained and lost through age.\r\nHe was speckled with barnacles,\r\nfine rosettes of lime,\r\nand infested\r\nwith tiny white sea-lice,\r\nand underneath two or three\r\nrags of green weed hung down.\r\nWhile his gills were breathing in\r\nthe terrible oxygen\r\nthe frightening gills,\r\nfresh and crisp with blood,\r\nthat can cut so badly\r\nI thought of the coarse white flesh\r\npacked in like feathers,\r\nthe big bones and the little bones,\r\nthe dramatic reds and blacks\r\nof his shiny entrails,\r\nand the pink swim-bladder\r\nlike a big peony.\r\nI looked into his eyes\r\nwhich were far larger than mine\r\nbut shallower, and yellowed,\r\nthe irises backed and packed\r\nwith tarnished tinfoil\r\nseen through the lenses\r\nof old scratched isinglass.\r\nThey shifted a little, but not\r\nto return my stare.\r\nIt was more like the tipping\r\nof an object toward the light.\r\nI admired his sullen face,\r\nthe mechanism of his jaw,\r\nand then I saw\r\nthat from his lower lip\r\nif you could call it a lip\r\ngrim, wet, and weaponlike,\r\nhung five old pieces of fish-line,\r\nor four and a wire leader\r\nwith the swivel still attached,\r\nwith all their five big hooks\r\ngrown firmly in his mouth.\r\nA green line, frayed at the end\r\nwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,\r\nand a fine black thread\r\nstill crimped from the strain and snap\r\nwhen it broke and he got away.\r\nLike medals with their ribbons\r\nfrayed and wavering,\r\na five-haired beard of wisdom\r\ntrailing from his aching jaw.\r\nI stared and stared\r\nand victory filled up\r\nthe little rented boat,\r\nfrom the pool of bilge\r\nwhere oil had spread a rainbow\r\naround the rusted engine\r\nto the bailer rusted orange,\r\nthe sun-cracked thwarts,\r\nthe oarlocks on their strings,\r\nthe gunnelsuntil everything\r\nwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!\r\nAnd I let the fish go.\r\n\r\nHelvellyn\r\nby Sir Walter Scott\r\n\r\nIclimbed the dark brow of the mighty Helvellyn,\r\nLakes and mountains beneath me gleamed misty and wide;\r\nAll was still, save by fits, when the eagle was yelling,\r\nAnd starting around me the echoes replied.\r\nOn the right, Striden-edge round the Red-tarn was bending,\r\nAnd Catchedicam its left verge was defending,\r\nOne huge, nameless rock in the front was ascending,\r\nWhen I marked the sad spot where the wanderer had died.\r\nDark green was that spot \'mid the brown mountain heather,\r\nWhere the pilgrim of nature lay stretched in decay,\r\nLike the corpse of an outcast abandoned to weather,\r\nTill the mountain-winds wasted the tenantless clay.\r\nNor yet quite deserted, though lonely extended,\r\nFor, faithful in death, his mute favourite attended,\r\nThe much-loved remains of her master defended,\r\nAnd chased the hill-fox and the raven away.\r\nHow long didst thou think that his silence was slumber?\r\nWhen the wind waved his garment, how oft didst thou start?\r\nHow many long days and long weeks didst thou number,\r\nEre he faded before thee, the friend of thy heart?\r\nAnd, oh! was it meet, thatno requiem read o\'er him,\r\nNo mother to weep, and no friend to deplore him,\r\nAnd thou, little guardian, alone stretched before him\r\nUnhonoured the pilgrim from life should depart?\r\nWhen a prince to the fate of the peasant has yielded,\r\nThe tapestry waves dark round the dim-lighted hall;\r\nWith scutcheons of silver the coffin is shielded,\r\nAnd pages stand mute by the canopied pall;\r\nThrough the courts, at deep midnight, the torches are gleaming;\r\nIn the proudly arched chapel the banners are beaming;\r\nFar adown the long aisle sacred music is streaming,\r\nLamenting a chief of the people should fall.\r\nBut meeter for thee, gentle lover of nature,\r\nTo lay down thy head like the meek mountain lamb,\r\nWhen, wildered, he drops from some cliff huge in stature,\r\nAnd draws his last sob by the side of his dam.\r\nAnd more stately thy couch by this desert lake lying,\r\nThy obsequies sung by the gray plover flying,\r\nWith but one faithful friend to witness thy dying\r\nIn the arms of Helvellyn and Catchedicam.\r\n\r\nMore Story Poems:\r\n\r\nLoveliest of Trees by A.
