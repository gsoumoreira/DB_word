Let the immense summer go.\r\nLay your long shadows over the sundials\r\nand over the meadows, let the free winds blow.\r\nCommand the late fruits to fatten and shine;\r\nO, grant them another Mediterranean hour!\r\nUrge them to completion, and with power\r\nconvey final sweetness to the heavy wine.\r\nWho has no house now, never will build one.\r\nWho\'s alone now, shall continue alone;\r\nhe\'ll wake, read, write long letters to friends,\r\nand pace the tree-lined pathways up and down,\r\nrestlessly, as autumn leaves drift and descend.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Harvest Moon\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\nUnder the harvest moon,\r\nWhen the soft silver\r\nDrips shimmering\r\nOver the garden nights,\r\nDeath, the gray mocker,\r\nComes and whispers to you\r\nAs a beautiful friend\r\nWho remembers.\r\n\r\nUnder the summer roses\r\nWhen the flagrant crimson\r\nLurks in the dusk\r\nOf the wild red leaves,\r\nLove, with little hands,\r\nComes and touches you\r\nWith a thousand memories,\r\nAnd asks you\r\nBeautiful, unanswerable questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, fallen camellias,\r\nif I were you,\r\nI\'d leap into the torrent! \r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEros shatters my soul:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains\r\nleveling oaks.\r\n \r\nSappho, fragment 42, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cheerful-chirping cricket\r\ncontends gray autumn\'s gay,\r\ncontemptuous of frost\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne apple, alone\r\nIn the abandoned orchard\r\nreddens for winter\r\n\r\n Patrick Blanche, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stayby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasses wilt:\r\nthe braking locomotive\r\ngrinds to a halt\r\n\r\n \r\nYamaguchi Seishi, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoman Fountainby Louise Bogan\r\nUp from the bronze, I saw\r\nWater without a flaw\r\nRush to its rest in air,\r\nReach to its rest, and fall.\r\n\r\nBronze of the blackest shade,\r\nAn element man-made,\r\nShaping upright the bare\r\nClear gouts of water in air.\r\n\r\nO, as with arm and hammer,\r\nStill it is good to strive\r\nTo beat out the image whole,\r\nTo echo the shout and stammer\r\nWhen full-gushed waters, alive,\r\nStrike on the fountain\'s bowl\r\nAfter the air of summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis darkening autumn:\r\nmy neighbor, \r\nhow does he continue?\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWild Asters\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nIn the spring I asked the daisies\r\nIf his words were true,\r\nAnd the clever, clear-eyed daisies\r\nAlways knew.\r\n\r\nNow the fields are brown and barren,\r\nBitter autumn blows,\r\nAnd of all the stupid asters\r\nNot one knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur life here on earth:\r\nto what shall we compare it?\r\nIt is not like a rowboat\r\ndeparting at daybreak,\r\nleaving no trace of us in its wake?\r\n\r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTonight I saw\r\nhow\r\nthe peony crumples\r\nin the fire\'s embers\r\n\r\n \r\nKatoh Shuhson, loose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember Graveyard\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees\r\nHoard last year\'s leaves, won\'t mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn\r\nTo elegiac dryads, and dour grass\r\nGuards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness\r\nHowever the grandiloquent mind may scorn\r\nSuch poverty. No dead men\'s cries\r\n\r\nFlower forget-me-nots between the stones\r\nPaving this grave ground. Here\'s honest rot\r\nTo unpick the heart, pare bone\r\nFree of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton\r\nBulks real, all saints\' tongues fall quiet:\r\nFlies watch no resurrections in the sun.\r\n\r\nAt the essential landscape stare, stare\r\nTill your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:\r\nWhatever lost ghosts flare,\r\nDamned, howling in their shrouds across the moor\r\nRave on the leash of the starving mind\r\nWhich peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese brown summer grasses?\r\nThe only remains \r\nof invincible warriors ...\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTears, Idle Tears\r\nby Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\r\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\nSad as the last which reddens over one\r\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nAh, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\r\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nDear as remembered kisses after death,\r\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\r\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn empty road\r\nlonelier than abandonment:\r\nthis autumn evening\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first morning of autumn:\r\nthe mirror I investigate\r\nreflects my fathers face\r\n\r\n \r\nShiki Masaoka, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry leaf flung awry:\r\nbright butterfly,\r\ngoodbye!\r\n\r\n Michael R.

The path\r\nIs slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber,\r\nThe stumps are twisted by the tempests\x92 wrath.\r\n\r\nBut that I knew these places are my own,\r\nI\x92d ask how came such wretchedness to cumber\r\nThe earth, and I to people it alone.\r\n\r\nIt rains across the country I remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember Midnight\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nLyric night of the lingering Indian Summer,\r\nShadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing,\r\nNever a bird, but the passionless chant of insects,\r\nCeaseless, insistent.\r\n\r\nThe grasshopper\x92s horn, and far-off, high in the maples,\r\nThe wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence\r\nUnder a moon waning and worn, broken,\r\nTired with summer.\r\n\r\nLet me remember you, voices of little insects,\r\nWeeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters,\r\nLet me remember, soon will the winter be on us,\r\nSnow-hushed and heavy.\r\n\r\nOver my soul murmur your mute benediction,\r\nWhile I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest,\r\nAs those who part look long in the eyes they lean to,\r\nLest they forget them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nO hushed October morning mild,\r\nThy leaves have ripened to the fall;\r\nTomorrow\x92s wind, if it be wild,\r\nShould waste them all.\r\nThe crows above the forest call;\r\nTomorrow they may form and go.\r\nO hushed October morning mild,\r\nBegin the hours of this day slow.\r\nMake the day seem to us less brief.\r\nHearts not averse to being beguiled,\r\nBeguile us in the way you know.\r\nRelease one leaf at break of day;\r\nAt noon release another leaf;\r\nOne from our trees, one far away.\r\nRetard the sun with gentle mist;\r\nEnchant the land with amethyst.\r\nSlow, slow!\r\nFor the grapes\x92 sake, if they were all,\r\nWhose leaves already are burnt with frost,\r\nWhose clustered fruit must else be lost\x97\r\nFor the grapes\x92 sake along the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beautiful Changes\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\nOne wading a Fall meadow finds on all sides\r\nThe Queen Annes Lace lying like lilies\r\nOn water; it glides\r\nSo from the walker, it turns\r\nDry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you\r\nValleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful changes as a forest is changed\r\nBy a chameleons tuning his skin to it;\r\nAs a mantis, arranged\r\nOn a green leaf, grows\r\nInto it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves\r\nAny greenness is deeper than anyone knows.\r\n\r\nYour hands hold roses always in a way that says\r\nThey are not only yours; the beautiful changes\r\nIn such kind ways,\r\nWishing ever to sunder\r\nThings and things\' selves for a second finding, to lose\r\nFor a moment all that it touches back to wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Rose of Summer\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nTis the last rose of summer\r\nLeft blooming alone;\r\nAll her lovely companions\r\nAre faded and gone;\r\nNo flower of her kindred,\r\nNo rosebud is nigh,\r\nTo reflect back her blushes,\r\nTo give sigh for sigh.\r\n\r\nIll not leave thee, thou lone one!\r\nTo pine on the stem;\r\nSince the lovely are sleeping,\r\nGo, sleep thou with them.\r\nThus kindly I scatter\r\nThy leaves oer the bed,\r\nWhere thy mates of the garden\r\nLie scentless and dead.\r\n\r\nSo soon may I follow,\r\nWhen friendships decay,\r\nAnd from Loves shining circle\r\nThe gems drop away.\r\nWhen true hearts lie withered\r\nAnd fond ones are flown,\r\nOh! who would inhabit\r\nThis bleak world alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament\r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease\r\nby R. S. Sam Gwynn\r\n\r\nSlow for the sake of flowers as they turn\r\n Toward sunlight, graceful as a line of sail\r\n Coming into \r\nthe wind. Slow for the mill\r\nWheel\'s heft and plummet, for the chug and churn\r\n Of water as it gathers, for the frail\r\n Half-life of \r\nspraylets as they toss and spill.\r\n\r\nFor all that lags and eases, all that shows\r\n The winding-downward and diminished scale\r\n Of days \r\ndeclining to a twilit chill,\r\nBreathe quietly, release into repose:\r\n\r\n \r\nBe still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 73\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou see\x92st the twilight of such day\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west;\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\r\nDeath\x92s second self, that seals up all in rest.\r\nIn me thou see\x92st the glowing of such fire,\r\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\r\nAs the deathbed whereon it must expire,\r\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\r\nThis thou perceiv\x92st, which makes thy love more strong,\r\nTo love that well which thou must leave ere long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOde to Autumn\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness, \r\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun; \r\nConspiring with him how to load and bless \r\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run; \r\nTo bend with apples the moss\'d cottage-trees,\r\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; \r\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells \r\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more, \r\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees, \r\nUntil they think warm days will never cease;\r\nFor Summer has o\'erbrimm\'d their clammy cells. \r\n\r\nWho hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? \r\nSometimes whoever seeks abroad may find \r\nThee sitting careless on a granary floor, \r\nThy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\r\nOr on a half-reap\'d furrow sound asleep, \r\nDrowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook \r\nSpares the next swath and all its twin\xe8d flowers: \r\nAnd sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep \r\nSteady thy laden head across a brook;\r\nOr by a cyder-press, with patient look, \r\nThou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours. \r\n\r\nWhere are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they? \r\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too,\x97 \r\nWhile barr\xe8d clouds bloom the soft-dying day\r\nAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; \r\nThen in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn \r\nAmong the river-sallows, borne aloft \r\nOr sinking as the light wind lives or dies; \r\nAnd full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\r\nHedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft \r\nThe redbreast whistles from a garden-croft; \r\nAnd gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOde to the West Wind\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nO wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn\x92s being,\r\nThou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\r\nAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,\r\n\r\nYellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\r\nPestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,\r\nWho chariotest to their dark wintry bed\r\n\r\nThe winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\r\nEach like a corpse within its grave, until\r\nThine azure sister of the Spring shall blow\r\n\r\nHer clarion o\x92er the dreaming earth, and fill\r\n(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\r\nWith living hues and odours plain and hill:\r\n\r\nWild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\r\nDestroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThou on whose stream, mid the steep sky\x92s commotion,\r\nLoose clouds like earth\x92s decaying leaves are shed,\r\nShook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,\r\n\r\nAngels of rain and lightning: there are spread\r\nOn the blue surface of thine a\xebry surge,\r\nLike the bright hair uplifted from the head\r\n\r\nOf some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge\r\nOf the horizon to the zenith\x92s height,\r\nThe locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge\r\n\r\nOf the dying year, to which this closing night\r\nWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,\r\nVaulted with all thy congregated might\r\n\r\nOf vapours, from whose solid atmosphere\r\nBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThou who didst waken from his summer dreams\r\nThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,\r\nLull\x92d by the coil of his cryst\xe0lline streams,\r\n\r\nBeside a pumice isle in Baiae\x92s bay,\r\nAnd saw in sleep old palaces and towers\r\nQuivering within the wave\x92s intenser day,\r\n\r\nAll overgrown with azure moss and flowers\r\nSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou\r\nFor whose path the Atlantic\x92s level powers\r\n\r\nCleave themselves into chasms, while far below\r\nThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear\r\nThe sapless foliage of the ocean, know\r\n\r\nThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,\r\nAnd tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;\r\nIf I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;\r\nA wave to pant beneath thy power, and share\r\n\r\nThe impulse of thy strength, only less free\r\nThan thou, O uncontrollable! If even\r\nI were as in my boyhood, and could be\r\n\r\nThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,\r\nAs then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed\r\nScarce seem\x92d a vision; I would ne\x92er have striven\r\n\r\nAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.\r\nOh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!\r\nI fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!\r\n\r\nA heavy weight of hours has chain\x92d and bow\x92d\r\nOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:\r\nWhat if my leaves are falling like its own!\r\nThe tumult of thy mighty harmonies\r\n\r\nWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,\r\nSweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,\r\nMy spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!\r\n\r\nDrive my dead thoughts over the universe\r\nLike wither\x92d leaves to quicken a new birth!\r\nAnd, by the incantation of this verse,\r\n\r\nScatter, as from an unextinguish\x92d hearth\r\nAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!\r\nBe through my lips to unawaken\x92d earth\r\n\r\nThe trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,\r\nIf Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To )\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Autumn\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Autumn, laden with fruit, and stain\x92d\r\nWith the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit\r\nBeneath my shady roof; there thou may\x92st rest,\r\nAnd tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe,\r\nAnd all the daughters of the year shall dance!\r\nSing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers.\r\n\r\n\x93The narrow bud opens her beauties to\r\nThe sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins;\r\nBlossoms hang round the brows of Morning, and\r\nFlourish down the bright cheek of modest Eve,\r\nTill clust\x92ring Summer breaks forth into singing,\r\nAnd feather\x92d clouds strew flowers round her head.\r\n\r\n\x93The spirits of the air live in the smells\r\nOf fruit; and Joy, with pinions light, roves round\r\nThe gardens, or sits singing in the trees.\x94\r\nThus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat,\r\nThen rose, girded himself, and o\x92er the bleak\r\nHills fled from our sight; but left his golden load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXLVII - For My Funeral\r\n\r\nO thou that from thy mansion\r\nThrough time and place to roam,\r\nDost send abroad thy children,\r\nAnd then dost call them home,\r\n\r\nThat men and tribes and nations\r\nAnd all thy hand hath made\r\nMay shelter them from sunshine\r\nIn thine eternal shade:\r\n\r\nWe now to peace and darkness\r\nAnd earth and thee restore\r\nThy creature that thou madest\r\nAnd wilt cast forth no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanksgiving Time\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\nWhen the night winds whistle through the trees and blow the crisp brown \r\nleaves a-crackling down,\r\nWhen the autumn moon is big and yellow-orange and round,\r\nWhen old Jack Frost is sparkling on the ground,\r\nIt\'s Thanksgiving Time!\r\n\r\nWhen the pantry jars are full of mince-meat and the shelves are laden with sweet \r\nspices for a cake\r\nWhen the butcher man sends up a turkey nice and fat to bake,\r\nWhen the stores are crammed with everything ingenious cooks can make,\r\nIt\'s Thanksgiving Time!\r\n\r\nWhen the gales of coming winter outside your window howl,\r\nWhen the Air is sharp and cheery so it drives away your scowl,\r\nWhen one\'s appetite craves turkey and will have no other fowl,\r\nIt\'s Thanksgiving Time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHighway Apple Trees\r\nby Rhina P. Espaillat\r\n\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows,\r\nmiraculous, above old caps and cans.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows\r\nIf they were meant to ripen under those\r\nslow summer clouds, cooled by their small green fans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows,\r\nnodding assent to every wind that blows,\r\nuselessly safe, far from our knives and pans.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows\r\nwhat future orchards live in cores one throws\r\nfrom glossy limousines or battered vans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest; it just grows,\r\ndenied the gift of purpose we suppose\r\nwould give it worth, conferred by human hands.\r\nThese apples, maybe sweet (nobody knows),\r\nsoften and fall, as autumn comes and goes,\r\ninto a sleep well-earned as any mans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEndymion\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\r\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\r\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\r\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\r\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\r\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\r\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\r\nOf all the unhealthy and o\'er-darkn\'d ways\r\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\r\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\r\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\r\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\r\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\r\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\r\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\r\n\'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,\r\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\r\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\r\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\r\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\r\nPouring unto us from the heaven\'s brink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nIt is a beauteous evening, calm and free,\r\nThe holy time is quiet as a Nun\r\nBreathless with adoration; the broad sun\r\nIs sinking down in its tranquillity;\r\nThe gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the Sea:\r\nListen! the mighty Being is awake,\r\nAnd doth with his eternal motion make\r\nA sound like thundereverlastingly.\r\nDear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,\r\nIf thou appear untouched by solemn thought,\r\nThy nature is not therefore less divine:\r\nThou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year;\r\nAnd worship\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine,\r\nGod being with thee when we know it not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowlyEden\r\nLips unused to thee\r\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\r\nAs the fainting bee\r\n\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums\r\nCounts his nectarsalights\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers.

My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking into Heaven\r\nwith\r\nLove and Gratitude\r\non Thanksgiving Day November 23, 2006\r\n\r\nby\r\nHiroshima survivor Takashi Thomas Tanemori\r\n\r\nTurning my face to Heaven\r\nI sense rather than see\r\nthe endless blue.\r\nBeyond the dancing leaves and soaring hawk,\r\nits immeasurable stillness\r\nreflects the wonder of all Creation.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nMorning dew glittering in the dawn,\r\nlike precious jewels;\r\nand twinkling stars echoing in the silent night,\r\nlike the songs of angels,\r\nWe gather the fruits of the earth,\r\ntill the barn is overflowing with bounty.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nMy heart fills with countless blessings:\r\nfood, shelter, clothing and friends to be encircled.\r\nLooking back, I see how\r\nmy stumbling steps have become a path\r\nand how, on this lonely road,\r\nI have never been alone.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe kindness of many has been\r\nlike a spring rain,\r\nbringing new life to my heart,\r\nas a Blade of Grass ever emerging\r\nfrom the ashes of the Past,\r\nI stand, Amazed at my blessings,\r\ngrateful for His Wonders!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
