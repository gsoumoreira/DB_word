But firstthinking of \r\nSocrateshow do we properly define the term villanelle? \r\nAs we are about to seevia definitions, a  \r\nbrief history and some stellar examplesthe villanelle \r\nmay be the most misunderstood of the English poetic forms.\r\n\r\nDefinition and History:\r\nThe villanelle is an \r\nItalian/French poetic form that became popular in English literary circles due to virtuoso \r\nperformances like Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by Dylan Thomas, One \r\nArt by Elizabeth Bishop and The Waking by Theodore Roethke. The villanelle \r\nrelies on refrains (the repetition of entire lines). The New Princeton Encyclopedia of \r\nPoetry and Poeticsstates that the villanelle first had as its only \r\ndistinguishing features a pastoral subject and use of refrain; in other respects \r\nit was without rule. The same entry assigns responsibility for the fixed-form villanelle \r\nwith nineteen lines to the English, not the creators of the \r\noriginal French and Italian forms. \r\nThe French word villanelle derives from the Italianvillanellaand \r\nthe Latinvillanus(meaning rustic or pastoral). \r\nThe term villanelle is related to villain, which originally meant \r\na \r\ndenizen of a villa, or a farmhand. The original villanella \r\nwas a ballad-like country song with a refrain, \r\nwhich did not adhere to any set form or have a predetermined length. The highly \r\nstructured  \r\nnow-standard form of the English villanelle is actually a latecomer. It \r\nwas introduced and popularized by William Empson in \r\nthe 1930s. The form was adopted by his friends Dylan Thomas and W. H. Auden, and \r\nlater by \r\nother notable poets such as Louise Bogan, Elizabeth Bishop, Ernest Dowson, Seamus Heaney, Donald \r\nJustice, Sylvia Plath and Edward Arlington Robinson. James Joyce \r\nincluded a villanelle written by his protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, in \r\nhis 1914 \r\nnovel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. More recently, \r\nvillanelles have been penned by Expansive and New Formalist poets such as Jared \r\nCarter, Rhina P. Espaillat, Annie Finch, Max Gutmann, R. S. (Sam) Gwynn, Anthony Hecht, Rose \r\nKelleher, Howard Nemerov, A. E. Stallings, Lewis Turco and Richard Wilbur. But there has never \r\nbeen a reason to impose a straitjacket on the villanelle. It started out like a \r\ncountry song with a chorus, so there\'s no need to take on airs!  \r\n\r\nThere is a Brief Timeline of the Villanelle at the bottom of this page, \r\nfor anyone who \r\nwould like to learn more about the evolution of the \r\nform. \r\n\r\nFor whatever it\'s worth, here are my top ten writers of villanelles and/or poems \r\nwith refrains: Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles \r\nd\'Orleans, Ernest Dowson, Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Alfred Noyes, William \r\nShakespeare and Dylan Thomas.\r\n\r\ncompiled by  Michael R.

He is best \r\nknown for The Canterbury Tales but was also a master of lyric forms \r\nsuch as the rondel, with its repeating lines that anticipated the villanelle. Chaucer has been called the Father of English literature \r\nand has been credited with helping to legitimize the English vernacular for \r\nliterary purposes at a time when French and Latin were preferred by the upper \r\ncrust in England. Chaucer was also the first writer to be buried in the Poets\' Corner of Westminster Abbey.There has been considerable confusion \r\nover the terms \r\nrondeau, rondel and roundel. Rather than dwelling on technicalities, I prefer \r\nthe a rose by any other name approach. I believe rondel was the term being \r\nused for the English variety in Chaucer\'s day, although spellings were haphazard \r\nback then. \r\nI. Merciles Beaute \r\n(Merciless Beauty)\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen. \r\nUnless your words heal me hastily,\r\nmy heart\'s wound will remain green;\r\nfor your eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain. \r\nBy all truth, I tell you faithfully\r\nthat you are of life and death my queen;\r\nfor at my death this truth shall be seen:\r\nyour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen.\r\n\r\nThere are more rondels by the medieval masters of the English formGeoffrey \r\nChaucer and Charles d\'Orleanslater on this page. And now, without \r\nfurther ado, here are the two most famous modern villanelles ...\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night \r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is the best villanelle in the English \r\nlanguage, in my opinion, and one of the most powerful and haunting poems ever \r\nwritten in any language. According to poets.org, Do Not Go Gentle Into That \r\nGood Night is the most popular poem in the English language. On March 28, 1951, \r\nThomas sent the poem to his friend Princess Marguerite Caetani, founder and \r\neditor of the journalBotteghe Oscure, saying: I have just finished \r\nthe short poem I enclose. The only person I cant show the little enclosed poem \r\nto is, of course, my father, who doesn\'t know he\'s dying.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bishop wrote a small handful of truly great poems such as One Art, \r\nThe Fish and The Armadillo, and can probably be considered a major poet \r\nfor those poems alone. One Art bends a few rules here and there, with \r\nwonderful results, and manages to be both clever and moving at the same time: a \r\nconsiderable accomplishment.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Old English poem, circa 960-990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\t\r\n\tMy people pursue him like crippled game.\r\n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\n\tWe are so different.\r\n\r\n\tWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\n\tHis island\'s a fortress, surrounded by fens.\r\n\tHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice. \r\n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\n\tWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds. \r\n\tWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\n\tbig battle-strong arms grabbed and held me.\r\n\tIt felt good, to a point, but the end was loathsome.\r\n\tWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\n\thas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\n\thave left me famished, deprived of real meat. \r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\n\tTranslator\'s Note:\r\n\tIn my opinion "Wulf and Eadwacer" is one of the truly great poems in the English language: \r\n\ta bittersweet saga of love and perhaps rape, enslavement and/or betrayal. This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a wild lament, a lover\'s lament, a \r\n\tpassion play and a riddle. However, most scholars choose to place it, \r\n\talong with\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament,within \r\n\tthe genre of thefrauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\n\textant poem authored by a woman in the then-fledgling English \r\nlanguage. It seems likely that the  \r\npoet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of ancient warriors \r\n\tand scops pretending \r\nto be women. It may also be called the first English feminist text, as the \r\n\tspeaker seems to be challenging and mocking the man, Eadwacer \r\n(Heaven-Watcher), who has apparently raped and \r\n\timpregnated her. The poems closing metaphor of a loveless relationship \r\nbeing like a song in which two voices never harmonized remains one of the \r\nstrongest in the English language, or any language. The poem is also notable for \r\n\tits rich ambiguity, which leaves much open to reader \r\n\tinterpretation. For instance, the wolf that has borne the whelp \r\n\tto the woods might be Wulf, the heartsick \r\n\tfemale speaker, Eadwacer, Eadwacer\'s jealous wife, or some other member of the clan. We \r\n\tdo not know what \r\n\thappened to the child in the woods, but we have the impression of a dark \r\n\tcatastrophe: perhaps human sacrifice. Wulf and Eadwacer is one of the first English poems to employ a refrain, a \r\n\thallmark of the great ballads and villanelles to come. The poem appeared in the Exeter Book, \r\n\tbetween Deor\'s Lament and the riddles, \r\n\tmeaning that it was written no later than around 990 AD. But the poem \r\n\titself is probably older, perhaps much older. I hope readers \r\nenjoy my translation of this powerful, haunting poem that speaks to us from the dawn of \r\n\tEnglish poetry.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nTears, Idle Tears\r\nby Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\r\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\nSad as the last which reddens over one\r\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nAh, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\r\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nDear as remembered kisses after death,\r\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\r\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nRecuerdo\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nWe were very tired, we were very merry\r\nWe had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.\r\nIt was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable\r\nBut we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,\r\nWe lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;\r\nAnd the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.\r\n\r\nWe were very tired, we were very merry\r\nWe had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;\r\nAnd you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,\r\nFrom a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;\r\nAnd the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,\r\nAnd the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.\r\n\r\nWe were very tired, we were very merry,\r\nWe had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.\r\nWe hailed, Good morrow, mother! to a shawl-covered head,\r\nAnd bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;\r\nAnd she wept, God bless you! for the apples and pears,\r\nAnd we gave her all our money but our subway fares.\r\n\r\nUnder the Greenwood Tree\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nUnder the greenwood tree\r\nWho loves to lie with me,\r\nAnd turn his merry note\r\nUnto the sweet bird\'s throat,\r\nCome hither, come hither, come hither:\r\nHere shall he see\r\nNo enemy\r\nBut winter and rough weather.\r\n\r\nWho doth ambition shun,\r\nAnd loves to live i\' the sun,\r\nSeeking the food he eats,\r\nAnd pleas\'d with what he gets,\r\nCome hither, come hither, come hither:\r\nHere shall he see\r\nNo enemy\r\nBut winter and rough weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Difference Between Lack and Absence\r\nby Annie Diamond\r\n\r\nBoth meannot having, but one meansmissingtoo.\r\nAbsencecan be welcome, butlackimplies desire\r\nthe absence of some noise, a lack of you\r\n\r\nmight be a good example. And its true\r\nthatlackmakes judgment, means that we require\r\nthe thing thats gone (a constant aching, too)\r\n\r\nwhileabsencejust reports; we can make do\r\nwith smaller things; it doesnt sound so dire.\r\nWho needs the noise? (But I need you.)\r\n\r\nAbsence lets us start anew,\r\nwhile lacking keeps us laced to its dark pyre.\r\nBoth arenot having, but one ismissingtoo,\r\n\r\nand wanting nothing more than to undo\r\nwhatever sins causedlackingto transpire.\r\nThe noise is done, and so, I guess, are you\r\n\r\nwith me. In verse I struggle to subdue\r\nmy restless heart. (The lacking makes me tired.)\r\nBoth meannot having; one meansmissingtoo\r\nthe absence of some noise, a lack of you.\r\n\r\nAnnie Diamond is a student at Barnard College, a private women\'s liberal arts \r\ncollege affiliated with Columbia University. She has also studied abroad at \r\nMansfield College, one of the constituent colleges of Oxford University in \r\nEngland. She recently completed her sophomore year at Barnard College, where she \r\nstudies English and creative writing. Her work has been published inApt,\r\nAvatar Review,Clockwise Cat, The Columbia Review and The Lyric. She \r\nwas awarded first prize \r\ninThe Lyric\'sCollege Poetry Contest for her villanelle The Difference \r\nBetween Lack and Absence. The same poem later won the Lyric Memorial Prize and \r\nwas named the best poem to appear in The Lyric for the year 2013. Her favorite writing spot is the Hungarian \r\nPastry Shop on New York City\'s 111th Street, and her number one life ambition is to appear on \r\nJeopardy.\r\n\r\nIt was my honor and pleasure to judge The Lyric\'s yearly and \r\nquarterly awards. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my favorite poem for \r\nthe year 2013 was written by a college student, Annie Diamond. I believe she has \r\na very bright future.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI Have a Crush on the Devil\r\nby Rose Kelleher \r\n\r\nI have a crush on the devil, teehee!\r\nIts wrong, but those horns just do something to me,\r\nthat little mustache, the seductive goatee.\r\n\r\nIve got a crush on Beelzebub, dash it!\r\nThat arrow-tipped tail of his has such panache; it\r\nwould make a nice whip. I like watching him thrash it.\r\n\r\nIve got a longing for Lucifer, darn it!\r\nTheres something about all that Evil Incarnate,\r\nhis naked red skin like a shimmering garnet.\r\n\r\nIve got a school-girlish thing for Hells King,\r\ninfernal, eternally barbecuing!\r\nThe respectable angels just havent his zing.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best humorous villanelles (or near villanelles) written by a contemporary poet.\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Rhina P. Espaillat\r\n\r\nFrom hair to horse to house to rose,\r\nher tongue unfastened like her gait,\r\nher gaze, her guise, her ghost, she goes.\r\n\r\nShe cannot name the thing she knows,\r\nword and its image will not mate.\r\nFrom hair to horse to house to rose\r\n\r\nthere is a circle will not close.\r\nShe babbles to her dinner plate.\r\nAll gaze and gaunt as ghost she goes \r\n\r\nsmiling at these, frowning at those.\r\nsmoothing the air to make it straight \r\nfrom hair to horse to house to rose.\r\n\r\nShe settles in a thoughtful pose\r\nas if she understood her fate,\r\nher face, her gaze, her ghost. She goes\r\n\r\ndownstream relentlessly, she flows\r\nwhere dark forgiving waters wait.\r\nFrom hair to horse to house to rose,\r\nher gaze, her guise, her ghost, she goes.\r\n\r\nThis is yet another fine villanelle by a contemporary poet. \r\n\r\nAcquainted with the Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost\'s Acquainted With The Night is more like a \r\nsonnet than a villanelle, but this marvelous poem has a killer opening line that doubles\r\nas a killer closing line. \r\n\r\nThe House on the Hill\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nThey are all gone away,\r\n\r\nThe House is shut and still,\r\nThere is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nThrough broken walls and gray\r\n\r\nThe winds blow bleak and shrill:\r\nThey are all gone away.\r\n\r\nNor is there one to-day\r\n\r\nTo speak them good or ill:\r\nThere is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nWhy is it then we stray\r\n\r\nAround the sunken sill?\r\nThey are all gone away,\r\n\r\nAnd our poor fancy-play\r\n\r\nFor them is wasted skill:\r\nThere is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nThere is ruin and decay\r\n\r\nIn the House on the Hill:\r\nThey are all gone away,\r\nThere is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nThe House on the Hill by Edward Arlington Robinson, is one of the spookier \r\nvillanelles; it reminds me of The Listeners by Walter de la Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I Could Tell You\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nTime will say nothing but I told you so,\r\nTime only knows the price we have to pay;\r\nIf I could tell you I would let you know.\r\n\r\nIf we should weep when clowns put on their show,\r\nIf we should stumble when musicians play,\r\nTime will say nothing but I told you so.\r\n\r\nThere are no fortunes to be told, although,\r\nBecause I love you more than I can say,\r\nIf I could tell you I would let you know.\r\n\r\nThe winds must come from somewhere when they blow,\r\nThere must be reasons why the leaves decay;\r\nTime will say nothing but I told you so.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the roses really want to grow,\r\nThe vision seriously intends to stay;\r\nIf I could tell you I would let you know.\r\n\r\nSuppose the lions all get up and go,\r\nAnd all the brooks and soldiers run away;\r\nWill Time say nothing but I told you so?\r\nIf I could tell you I would let you know.\r\n\r\nAuden\'s lovely villanelle If I Could Tell You might have been written to a \r\nfriend, a lover, or a child. In the poem\'s penultimate line, Time is \r\ncapitalized, like the name of a God, and I am reminded of the God of the book of \r\nJob, who refuses to explain the reasons for human suffering, and so comes off as \r\ninsufferable.\r\n\r\nThe Waking\r\nby Theodore Roethke\r\n\r\nI wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. \r\nI feel my fate in what I cannot fear.\r\nI learn by going where I have to go.\r\n\r\nWe think by feeling. What is there to know?\r\nI hear my being dance from ear to ear.\r\nI wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.\r\n\r\nOf those so close beside me, which are you?\r\nGod bless the Ground! I shall walk softly there,\r\nAnd learn by going where I have to go.\r\n\r\nLight takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?\r\nThe lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;\r\nI wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.\r\n\r\nGreat Nature has another thing to do\r\nTo you and me; so take the lively air,\r\nAnd, lovely, learn by going where to go.\r\n\r\nThis shaking keeps me steady. I should know.\r\nWhat falls away is always. And is near.\r\nI wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.\r\nI learn by going where I have to go.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roethke\'s villanelle The Waking has some wonderful lines, such as We think by feeling. What is there to know? \r\nand The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair. It seems to be a poem about \r\nlife-in-death, and perhaps love-in-the-act-of-dying. Whether the reader finds \r\nthe poem terrifying, or calming, or both, probably depends on the reader. \r\n\r\nIt Is the Pain\r\nby William Empson \r\n\r\nIt is the pain, it is the pain endures.\r\nYour chemic beauty burned my muscles through.\r\nPoise of my hands reminded me of yours.\r\n\r\nWhat later purge from this deep toxin cures?\r\nWhat kindness now could the old salve renew?\r\nIt is the pain, it is the pain endures.\r\n\r\nThe infection slept (custom or change inures);\r\nAnd when pain\'s secondary phase was due,\r\nPoise of my hands reminded me of yours.\r\n\r\nHow safe I felt, whom memory assures \r\nRich that your grace safely by heart I knew.\r\nIt is the pain, it is the pain endures.\r\n\r\nMy stare drank deep beauty that still allures.\r\nMy heart pumps yet the poison draught of you.\r\nPoise of my hands reminded me of yours.\r\n\r\nYou are still kind whom the same shape immures.\r\nKind and beyond adieu. We miss our cue.\r\nIt is the pain, it is the pain endures.\r\nPoise of my hands reminded me of yours.\r\n\r\nWilliam Epsom\'s villanelle is not as well-known as others on this page, but \r\nperhaps it should be. I read the poem as an extended metaphysical conceit, with \r\na lover being compared metaphorically to both toxin and cure (albeit an \r\nineffective cure). The patient\'s problems came in two stages: the first when \r\nhe fell in love with a beautiful woman, the second when his heart could not \r\nforget her and so kept pumping the poison draught of her memory. \r\n\r\nMad Girl\'s Love Song\r\nby Sylvia Plath \r\n\r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; \r\nI lift my lids and all is born again. \r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.) \r\n\r\nThe stars go waltzing out in blue and red, \r\nAnd arbitrary blackness gallops in: \r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that you bewitched me into bed \r\nAnd sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. \r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nGod topples from the sky, hell\'s fires fade: \r\nExit seraphim and Satan\'s men: \r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.\r\n\r\nI fancied you\'d return the way you said, \r\nBut I grow old and I forget your name. \r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nI should have loved a thunderbird instead; \r\nAt least when spring comes they roar back again. \r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. \r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath is best known today for three things: (1) her poem Daddy in which \r\nshe compared her father to a Nazi, the Devil, Dracula and Dr. Frankestein; (2) \r\nbeing the subject of her autobiographical novel about clinical depression, \r\nThe Bell Jar; and (3) committing suicide by sticking her head in the oven \r\nand turning on the gas. While her life was brief and tortured, she was a \r\ntalented poet whose work deserves to be read on its own merits. \r\n\r\nTheocritis\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nO singer of Persephone!\r\nIn the dim meadows desolate\r\nDost thou remember Sicily?\r\n\r\nStill through the ivy flits the bee\r\nWhere Amaryllis lies in state;\r\nO Singer of Persephone!\r\n\r\nSimaetha calls on Hecate\r\nAnd hears the wild dogs at the gate;\r\nDost thou remember Sicily?\r\n\r\nStill by the light and laughing sea\r\nPoor Polypheme bemoans his fate;\r\nO Singer of Persephone!\r\n\r\nAnd still in boyish rivalry\r\nYoung Daphnis challenges his mate;\r\nDost thou remember Sicily?\r\n\r\nSlim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,\r\nFor thee the jocund shepherds wait;\r\nO Singer of Persephone!\r\nDost thou remember Sicily?\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde also wrote a double villanelle titled Pan, about the goat-foot God of Arcady.\r\n\r\nVillanelle for an Anniversary\r\nby Seamus Heaney \r\n\r\nA spirit moved.

S. Eliot is obvious, and anyone who reads his \r\nbest poems can easily understand the attraction. Other writers unabashedly \r\nborrowed phrases from Dowson: gone with the wind, the days of wine and \r\nroses, hollow lands, etc. The best poets write memorable lines, and Dowson\'s \r\nbest poems are full of memorable lines. \r\n    \r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following poems are not typically called villanelles, but they employ refrains \r\nand/or repetition to wonderful effect ... \r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\n      Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n   \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n   \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n     \r\n   \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n     \r\n   \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair\r\nLean on a garden urn\r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair\r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise\r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nAlong with Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot helped create modern English free verse. This poem \r\ndemonstrates his his remarkable talents. While Eliot was a sophisticated, urbane \r\npoet, one of his main themes was human love, and he often comes across as a somewhat \r\nnerdy romantic. \r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nTom Moore was an Irish tenor, songwriter and poet; this wonderfully haunting poem \r\ndemonstrates his virtuosity as a poet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is one of my favorite poets. Along with the poem above, After the \r\nPersian is one of the best poems in the English language. \r\n\r\n\r\nin Just-by E. E. Cummings\r\n\r\nin Just-\r\nspring when the world is mud-\r\nluscious the little\r\nlame baloonman\r\n\r\nwhistles far and wee\r\n\r\nand eddieandbill come\r\nrunning from marbles and\r\npiracies and it\'s\r\nspring\r\n\r\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\r\n\r\nthe queer\r\nold baloonman whistles\r\nfar and wee\r\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\r\n\r\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\r\nit\'s\r\nspring\r\nand\r\n\r\n the\r\ngoat-footed\r\n\r\nbaloonMan whistles\r\nfar\r\nand\r\nwee\r\n\r\nE. E. Cummings (or e. e. cummings) has long been one of my favorite poets. I \r\nlove his musicality, his whimsy, and his defiance of convention. In his darker \r\npoems like I sing of Olaf, glad and big, I love his fierce wrath against \r\ninjustice. In my opinion he is one of the major poets of the modern era.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the Masters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal by E. A. Robinson is one of the eeriest, most haunting poems in \r\nthe English language. Robinson wrote a number of other very strong poems and \r\nremains one of America\'s best early modern poets. Several of \r\nhis poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaming of Parts\r\nby Henry Reed\r\n\r\nVixi duellis nuper idoneus\r\nEt militavi non sine glori\r\n\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling swivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let me\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\r\n They call it easing the Spring.\r\n\r\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\r\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of balance,\r\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the almond-blossom\r\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards,\r\n For today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nHenry Reed is likely to be remembered by this poem alone, but fortunately for him \r\n(and for us) it is so magnificent that it should make him immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was one of the early romantics (perhaps a forerunner of both \r\nShelley and Clare), and one of my early favorites along with Blake and Housman. \r\nHe still reads well today, I think. He is, of course, most famous for his \r\nnostalgic drinking song Auld Lang Syne. Several of his poems can be found on \r\nthe \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti wrote a handful of immortal poems, and that makes her an \r\nimmortal poet. \r\nTwo of her poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem that should make its author \r\nimmortal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nTichborne\'s elegy to himself remains one of the best and most powerful in the \r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\nRondel: Your Smiling Mouth\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains,\r\nYour hands so smooth, each finger straight and plain,\r\nYour little feetplease, what more can I say?\r\n\r\nIt is my fetish when youre far away\r\nTo muse on these and thus to soothe my pain\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains.\r\n\r\nSo would I beg you, if I only may,\r\nTo see such sights as I before have seen,\r\nBecause my fetish pleases me. Obscene?\r\nIll be obsessed until my dying day\r\nBy your sweet smiling mouth and eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains!\r\n\r\nOft in My Thought\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\r\n Around the advent of the fledgling year,\r\nFor something pretty that I really ought\r\n To give my lady dear;\r\n But that sweet thought\'s been wrested from me, clear,\r\n Since death, alas, has sealed her under clay\r\n And robbed the world of all that\'s precious here\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\r\n Acceptable, as suits my age\'s hour?\r\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\r\n Her worth? It tests my power!\r\n I serve her now with masses and with prayer;\r\n For it would be \r\na shame for me to stray\r\n Far from my faith, when my time\'s drawing near\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\r\n And the cost of everything became \r\nso dear;\r\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\r\n Take my good deeds, as many as there are,\r\n And crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\r\n As heaven\'s truest maid! And may I \r\nsay:\r\n Most good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\r\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\r\n Then my heart floods like an overflowing bay\r\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\nRejection\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain.\r\nI\'m guiltless, yet my sentence has been cast.\r\nI tell you truly, needless now to feign,\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain.\r\nAlas, that Nature in your face compassed\r\nSuch beauty, that no man may hope attain\r\nTo mercy, though he perish from the pain;\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain. \r\nEscape\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

His face burnt like a brand\r\n\r\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;\r\nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight,\r\n \r\n(Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)\r\nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nI\r\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;\r\nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon,\r\nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor,\r\nA red-coat troop came marching\r\n \r\nMarchingmarching\r\nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nII\r\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,\r\nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;\r\nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!\r\nThere was death at every window;\r\n \r\nAnd hell at one dark window;\r\nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.\r\n\r\nIII\r\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;\r\nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\r\n\r\nNow, keep good watch! and they kissed her.\r\n \r\nShe heard the dead man say\r\nLook for me by moonlight;\r\n \r\nWatch for me by moonlight;\r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!\r\nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!\r\nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like \r\nyears,\r\nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight,\r\n \r\nCold, on the stroke of midnight,\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!\r\n\r\nV\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\r\n\r\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,\r\nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;\r\nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight;\r\n \r\nBlank and bare in the moonlight;\r\nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s refrain.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;\r\nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not \r\nhear?\r\nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,\r\nThe highwayman came riding,\r\n \r\nRiding, riding!\r\nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\r\n\r\nVII\r\n Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing \r\nnight!\r\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\r\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,\r\nThen her finger moved in the moonlight,\r\n \r\nHer musket shattered the moonlight,\r\nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood\r\nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\r\n\r\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear\r\nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\n \r\nThe landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.\r\n\r\nIX\r\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,\r\nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\r\n\r\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,\r\nWhen they shot him down on the highway,\r\n \r\nDown like a dog on the highway,\r\nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.\r\n\r\nX\r\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,\r\nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,\r\nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,\r\nA highwayman comes riding\r\n \r\nRidingriding\r\nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;\r\nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;\r\nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there\r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\n \r\nBess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\r\nAlfred Noyes died the same year that I was born (1958). The Highwayman was \r\nmy favorite poem as a young boy, and remains one of my favorite poems to this \r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton\'s Defense of Carnality\r\n\r\nby Jack Foley\r\n \r\n  Truly I have lost weight, I have lost weight,\r\n  grown lean in loves defense,\r\n  in loves defense grown grave.\r\n  It was concupiscence that brought me to the state:\r\n  all bone and a bit of skin\r\n  to keep the bone within.\r\n  Flesh is no heavy burden for one possessed of little\r\n  and accustomed to its loss.\r\n  I lean to love, which leaves me lean, till lean turn into lack.\r\n  A wanton bone, I sing my song\r\n  and travel where the bone is blown\r\n  and extricate true love from lust\r\n  as any man of wisdom must.\r\n  Then wherefore should I rage\r\n  against this pilgrimage\r\n  from gravel unto gravel?\r\n  Circuitous I travel\r\n  from love to lack / and lack to lack,\r\n  from lean to lack\r\n  and back.\r\n\r\nJack Foley is a contemporary poet, and a damn good one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Rain\r\nby Jared Carter\r\n\r\nAfter the rain, its time to walk the field\r\n\tagain, near where the river bends. Each year\r\n\tI come to look for what this place will yield\r\n\tlost things still rising here.\r\n\r\nThe farmers plow turns over, without fail,\r\na crop of arrowheads, but where or why\r\nthey fall is hard to say. They seem, like hail,\r\ndropped from an empty sky,\r\n\r\nyet for an hour or two, after the rain\r\nhas washed away the dusty afterbirth\r\nof their return, a few will show up plain\r\non the reopened earth.\r\n\r\nStill, even these are hard to see\r\nat first they look like any other stone.\r\nThe trick to finding them is not to be\r\ntoo sure about whats known;\r\n\r\nconvictions liable to say straight off\r\nthis ones a leaf, or that ones merely clay,\r\nand miss the point: after the rain, soft\r\nfurrows show one way\r\n\r\nacross the field, but what is hidden here\r\nrequires a different viewthe glance of one\r\nnot looking straight ahead, who in the clear\r\nlight of the morning sun\r\n\r\nsimply keeps wandering across the rows,\r\nletting his own perspective change.\r\nAfter the rain, perhaps, something will show,\r\nglittering and strange.\r\n\r\nJared Carter is another contemporary poet well worth reading: not only now, but \r\nalso in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Villanelle\'s Appeal\r\nby Max Gutmann\r\n\r\nThe villanelle\'s appeal is rather fleeting.\r\nIt\'s fun at first. The fun fades quickly, though.\r\nThe lines are few that really bear repeating.\r\n\r\nThe suffocating pattern\'s self-defeating.\r\nRepetitive, mechanical and slow,\r\nThe villanelle\'s appeal is rather fleeting.\r\n\r\nWhat poets feel their verses gain by beating\r\nA line to death and then some, I don\'t know.\r\nThe lines are few that really bear repeating.\r\n\r\nIt\'s like a theater with half the seating\r\nRoped off, reserved for folks who never show.\r\nThe villanelle\'s appeal is rather fleeting:\r\n\r\nThe end of every stanza\'s like reheating\r\nThe stuff you had for lunch an hour ago.\r\nThe lines are few that really bear repeating.\r\n\r\nLike grating TV advertisements bleating\r\nAbout NEW products, nothing\'s new, and so\r\nThe villanelle\'s appeal is rather fleeting.\r\nThe lines are few that really bear repeating.\r\n\r\nMax Gutmann\'s tongue-in-cheek villanelle argues against the form, while proving \r\nthat it can be fun to read, and entertaining!\r\n\r\nLast and perhaps least, here are four villanelles of \r\nmine:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Divide\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe sea was not salt the first tide ... \r\nwas man born to sorrow that first day\r\nwith the moona pale beacon across the Divide,\r\nthe brighter for longing, an object denied\r\nthe tug at his heart\'s pink, bourgeoning clay?\r\n\r\nThe sea was not salt the first tide ...\r\nbut grew bitter, bitterman\'s torrents supplied. \r\nThe bride of their longingforever astray, \r\nher shield a cold beacon across the Divide,\r\nflashing pale signals: Decide. Decide.\r\nChoose me, or His Brightness, I will not stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea was not salt the first tide ...\r\nimploring her, ebbing: Abide, abide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silver fish flash there, the manatees gray.\r\n\r\nThe moon, a pale beacon across the Divide,\r\nhas taught us to seek Love\'s concealed side:\r\nthe dark face of longing, the poets say.\r\n\r\nThe sea was not salt the first tide ...\r\nthe moon a pale beacon across the Divide.\r\n\r\nThe Divide is essentially a formal villanelle despite the non-formal line \r\nbreaks. \r\n\r\nOrdinary Love\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIndescribableour loveand still we say\r\nwith eyes averted, turning out the light,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way\r\n\r\nand tug the coverlet where once we lay,\r\nall suntanned limbs entangled, shivering, white ...\r\nindescribably in love. Or so we say.\r\n\r\nYour hair\'s blonde thicket now is tangle-gray;\r\nyou turn your back; you murmur to the night,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nBeneath the sheets our hands and feet would stray\r\nto warm ourselves.We do not touch despite\r\na love so indescribable.We say\r\n\r\nwe\'re older now, that love has had its day.\r\nBut that which Love once countenanced, delight,\r\nstill makes you indescribable.I say,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nOrdinary Love was the winner of the 2001 Algernon Charles Swinburne poetry contest. \r\nIt was originally published by Romantics Quarterly and nominated by the \r\njournal for the Pushcart Prize. \r\n\r\nBecause Her Heart Is Tender\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor Beth\r\n\r\nShe scrawled soft words in soap: Never Forget,\r\nDove-white on her car\'s window, and the wren,\r\nbecause her heart is tender, might regret\r\nit called the sun to wake her. As I slept,\r\nshe heard lost names recounted, one by one.\r\n\r\nShe wrote in sidewalk chalk: Never Forget,\r\nand kept her heart\'s own counsel. No rain swept\r\naway those words, no tear leaves them undone.\r\n\r\nBecause her heart is tender with regret,\r\nbruised by razed towers\' glass and steel and stone\r\nthat shatter on and on and on and on,\r\nshe stitches in wet linen: NEVER FORGET,\r\nand listens to her heart\'s emphatic song.\r\n\r\nThe wren might tilt its head and sing along\r\nbecause its heart once understood regret\r\nwhen fledglings fell beyond, beyond, beyond ...\r\nits reach, and still the boot-heeled world strode on.\r\n\r\nShe writes in adamant: NEVER FORGET\r\nbecause her heart is tender with regret.\r\n\r\nHangovers\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nWe forget that, before we were born,\r\nour parents had lives of their own,\r\nran drunk in the streets, or half-stoned.\r\nYes, our parents had lives of their own\r\nuntil we were born; then, undone,\r\nthey were buying their parents gravestones\r\nand finding gray hairs of their own\r\n(because we were born lacking some\r\nof their curious habits, but soon\r\nwould certainly get them). Half-stoned,\r\nwe watched them dig graves of their own.\r\nTheir lives would be over too soon\r\nfor their curious habits to bloom\r\nin us (though our children were born\r\nnine months from that night on the town\r\nwhen, punch-drunk in the streets or half-stoned,\r\nwe first proved we had lives of our own).\r\n \r\n\r\nMore Villanelles\r\n\r\nReflection from Anita Loos by William Empson\r\n\r\nMariana by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\nVillanelle of Sunset by Ernest Dowson\r\nVillanelle of Marguerites by Ernest Dowson\r\nVillanelle of Acheron by Ernest Dowson\r\nVillanelle: The Psychological Hour by Ezra Pound\r\nBut I Can\'t [If I Could Tell You] by W.

Before Passerat created his nonce form, there was \r\nno poetic villanelle form to speak of, and villanelles were performed at \r\nchoral dances (think of dancers calling out lines to music at a hoe-down).\r\n\r\n[**]  Wilhelm T\xe9nint appears to be the source of the idea \r\nthat the more exacting form was older and more common than it really was. \r\n\r\n[***]As for the villanelle, M. De Banville declares that it is the fairest \r\njewel in the casket of the muse Erato! However, it seems the form was not \r\nreally ancient, but relatively new and one-of-a-kind. \r\n\r\nBut all\'s well that ends well, and we have some marvelous poems as a result of \r\nall the confusion! \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n \t\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Best Sonnets,\r\nThe Best Villanelles,\r\nVillanelles by Michael R.
