Trump\r\nDonald Trump Inaugural Poem (apologies to Robert Frost)\r\nMarch for Our Lives Poetry\r\nDonald Trump Valentine Poems\r\nJoe Biden Poems\r\n\r\nDid you know that Donald Trump is not only a poet, but a major poet, a \r\npenner of sublime verse?\r\n\r\nLike the Bard of Avon, The Donald has coined new words and terms. The American \r\nDialect Society named fake news its 2017 Word of the Year, pointing out that \r\nTrump helped change the definition of fake news from disinformation presented \r\nas news to actual news that is claimed to be untrue. Meanwhile alternative \r\nfacts was named the Euphemism of the Year and the ever-mysterious covfefe was \r\nnamed the WTF Word of the Year. So Trump won the word coinage Triple Crown! He\'s \r\nthe Secretariat of BS!\r\nBut Trump has gone vastly beyond Shakespeare by creating his own language, \r\nTrumpspeak. Ugly fences are beautiful walls. Nazis are good people. \r\nSeparating dark-skinned children from their mothers is the Christian thing to \r\ndo. Prisoners of war are not heroes because they got caught. The only real \r\nhero is Cadet Bone Spurs, who avoided the Vietnam War by claiming to have the \r\nrich kids\' disease. Make America great again \r\ncontains a misspelling (it should be grate). But Trump has all the best \r\nwords.\r\n\r\nYou will find all Trump\'s best poems on this page, including his \r\nfamous inaugural poem It\'s a Carnage! We also have some of his best \r\nValentine\'s Day poems. And of course The Donald also inspires poetry. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Spur to Action\r\nby J. L.

This is \r\nher update of Hussle  Motivate by Nipsey Hussle. We believe the lyrics were \r\nslightly altered by Megan Rapinoe ...\r\n\r\nAin\'t really trip on the credit,\r\nI just paid all of my dues,\r\nI just respected the game.\r\nNow my name\r\nall in the news!\r\nTrippin\' on all of my moves,\r\nquote me on this,\r\ngot a lot more to prove!\r\n@nipseyhussle #tmc #cheesin @mrapinoe \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my research, I was surprised to learn that Donald Trump is an accomplished poeta master of \r\nmodern free verse, odes, sonnets, limericks, villanelles, sestinas, quatrains, \r\nheroic couplets and rhyme royal. Indeed, Trump rivals those other great American \r\npolitical poets: George W. Bush, Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann! But\r\nDonald Trump did not have a poet \r\nrecite an Inauguration Day Poem. Why? Probably for the same reason that he \r\ncouldn\'t get A-list singers and bands to perform at his Inauguration: no \r\nself-respecting person with a sense of decency and real American values wants to lend credence \r\nto Trump\'s creepy presidency. Maya Angelou would never endorse Trump, nor would \r\nRichard Blanco, Miller Williams or Elizabeth Alexander. But there is a solution, and I am going to provide it. \r\nHere, from the hyperactive mouth of Trump Himself, is his \r\nInauguration Day Poem:\r\n\r\nIt\'s a Carnage! (Part I)\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nI can\'t believe what our country is doing!\r\nYou talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the \r\nworst!\r\nIt\'s a carnage!\r\nThis guy, he\'s like a maniac, OK?\r\nI mean, this guy doesn\'t play games!\r\nAnd we can\'t play games with him!\r\nIt\'s a carnage!\r\nNow we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very \r\nquick!\r\nWe could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and  save these lives!\r\nIt\'s a carnage!\r\nMake America great again!\r\nPolitics is such a disgrace!\r\nGood people don\'t go into government!\r\nIt\'s a carnage!\r\nPlease don\'t feel so stupid or insecure; it\'s not your fault!\r\nIt\'s largely a rigged system!\r\nI\x92m just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election ...\r\nPlease say it! Please tell me: Trump, you\'re fired!\r\nIt\'s a carnage!\r\n\r\nObviously, Trump is warning us about the greatest threat currently \r\nposed to the United States of America: the man known as Donald John Trump. \r\nSomewhere deep within, he knows just how terrible he is, and he is literally\r\nbegging us to stop him from destroying so many lives. He is \r\nasking us to fire himto impeach himbefore \r\nit\'s too late. He points out that politics is a disgrace and good people don\'t \r\nget into government; hence he is admitting that he is a bad person and a \r\ndisgrace. As for my analysis of his poem as a work of art, it goes without \r\nsaying that Trump is a much better poet than president. The poem is entirely \r\nmodern free verse, with a killer refrain. The double use of the word just in \r\nL17 is surely not accidental; Trump is telling us that justice can only be done \r\nby canceling the results of the rigged election that made him president when he \r\nlost by nearly three million votes, with the help of Russian influence. Trump\'s \r\ninaugural poem communicates considerable emotion; the hallmark of true poetry. \r\nI know it scares the hell out of me, and I don\'t scare easy! Yes, it is a \r\ncarnage, and yes, we should fire Trump, post haste.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a Carnage! (Part II)\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nIt\x92s a carnage! \r\nWe bleed depletion!\r\nEven our disagreements are in disrepair!\r\nIt\x92s a carnage!\r\nWe must flush away the infrastructure of freedom,\r\nbanish the Islamic lady to landscapes overseas\r\nripped up and rusted out by the sad solidarity of our sprawling bombs!\r\nIt\x92s a carnage!\r\nWe must send our soldiers like thieves stealing:\r\nbecause oil was made to be stolen!\r\nIt\x92s a carnage!\r\nWhen our soldiers lie silent under subsidized tombstones\r\nwhile the trapped trillions tunnel underground toward unrealized urban streets\r\n\r\nlong wind-swept by nuclear winter ...\r\nIt\x92s a carnage!\r\n\r\nIt\'s a Carnage! (Part III)\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nI can\'t believe what our country is doing!\r\nQaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and \r\nwe\'re sitting around!\r\nWe have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we\'re not bringing them in to \r\nstop this horrible carnage and that\'s what it is: It\'s a carnage!\r\nYou talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the \r\nworst!\r\nNow we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very \r\nquick!\r\nWe could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives!\r\n\r\nAnalysis: Trump has revealed himself to be an incredible \r\nhypocrite, because he relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton for her support of \r\nmilitary interventions in the Middle East. But Trump is on the record supporting \r\nsuch interventions, and for the same reasons. Perhaps Clinton was wrong to \r\nsupport the invasion of Libya. Perhaps she was wrong to believe that deposing \r\nQaddafi would be relatively quick and easy, and could be done surgically. But \r\nobviously Trump shared those opinions. Hence, he comes off as a liar and a \r\nhypocrite.\r\n\r\nIf the subject interests you, to see how\r\n\r\nTrump fulfills Biblical prophecies, just click the hyperlink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMother of Cowards\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch aka The Loyal Opposition\r\n\r\nSo unlike the brazen giant of Greek fame\r\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land,\r\nSpread-eagled, showering gold, a strumpet stands:\r\nA much-used trollop with a torch, whose flame\r\nHas long since been extinguished. And her name?\r\nMother of Cowards! From her enervate hand\r\nSoft ash descends. Her furtive eyes demand\r\nAllegiance to her Pimp\'s repulsive game.\r\n\r\nKeep, ancient lands, your wretched poor! cries she\r\nWith scarlet lips. Give me your hale, your whole,\r\nYour huddled tycoons, yearning to be pleased!\r\nThe wretched refuse of your toilet hole?\r\nOh, never send one unwashed child to me!\r\nI await Trump\'s pleasure by the gilded bowl!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree-Verse Sonnet to Gun Control\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nWe have to look very strongly at no-fly lists!\r\n\r\nWe have to bring back law and order!\r\n\r\nWe had to take the guns away\r\nfrom these people that have them\r\nand that are bad people\r\nthat shouldn\x92t have them!\r\n\r\nThese are people\r\nthat are bad people!\r\nThat shouldn\x92t be!\r\n\r\nAnalysis by the NRA: So far, complete and utter silence! And of course \r\nTrump didn\'t keep his promises. Rather, the NRA contributed $30 million to \r\nhelping Trump win the 2016 presidential election, and Trump signed a bill \r\nblocking Obama-era background checks on guns for people with mental illnesses. \r\nThe Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental \r\ndisorders from being able to purchase firearms. It was crafted as part of \r\nObama\x92s efforts to strengthen the federal background check system in the wake of \r\nthe 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Trump \r\nexplained his position on gun control by saying: It\'s no good, it\'s no fair, \r\nand they\'re not going to screw around with the Second Amendment. But it\'s hard \r\nto imagine that the Founding Fathers would have thought it wise to let mentally \r\nill people buy assault weapons. The massacre of 17 students and staff in \r\nParkland, Florida on Valentine\'s Day in 2018 is a case in point. The murderer \r\nhad a history of mental illness and was under the legal age to buy a handgun. \r\nBut he was able to legally buy an AR-15 assault weapon. And Trump didn\'t do \r\nanything he had promised to keep students from being shot to pieces. As Trump \r\nsaid in his most famous poem, It\'s a carnage!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree-Verse Ode to Abortion\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nIs \r\nabortion early in a pregnancy murder?\r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is this:\r\nWith caveatslife of the mother, incest, rape.\r\nThat\'s where I stand.\r\nSo, I\'m pro-life, but with the caveats.\r\nYou have to have it with the caveats.\r\n\r\nWhat if a pregnancy happens outside those caveatsis abortion murder then?\r\n\r\nIt depends.\r\n\r\nAnalysis by pro-life evangelical Christians: Exit polls reveal that \r\nfour out of five, or 80% of evangelical Christians, voted for Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s Incredible!\r\nan Ode to Kim Jong-un\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nIf you look at North Korea\x97this guy, he\'s like a maniac, OK?\r\nAnd you have to give him credit!\r\nHow many young guys\x97he was like 26 or 25 when his father died\x97take over these \r\ntough generals,\r\nand all of a sudden\x97you know, it\'s pretty amazing when you \r\nthink of it!\r\nHow does he do that?\r\nEven though it is a culture and it\'s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes \r\nover, and he\'s the boss!\r\nIt\'s incredible!\r\nHe wiped out the uncle!\r\nHe wiped out this one, that one!\r\nI mean, this guy doesn\'t play games!\r\nAnd we can\'t play games with him!\r\nBecause he really does have missiles!\r\nAnd he really does have nukes!\r\nIt\'s INCREDIBLE!\r\n\r\nAnalysis by Michael R. Burch: Trump\'s word choices seem significant: credit, \r\namazing, incredible. He even manages to make maniac sound like a good \r\nthing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe Did That So Good!\r\nan Ode to Saddam Hussein\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nHe was a bad guy\x97really bad guy.\r\nBut you know what he did well?\r\nHe killed terrorists!\r\nHe did that so good!\r\nThey didn\'t read them the rights!\r\nThey didn\'t talk!\r\nThey were terrorists!\r\nOver!\r\n\r\nAnalysis by Jake Sullivan, a foreign policy expert: Trump\'s praise for brutal \r\nstrongmen seemingly knows no bounds ... Trump yet again lauded Saddam Hussein as \r\na great killer of terrorists, noting with approval that he never bothered to \r\nread anyone their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vicious Ones\r\nby Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nI was attacked viciously\r\nBy those women!\r\nOf course, it\'s very hard for them\r\nTo attack me on looks,\r\nBecause I\'m so good looking!\r\nBut I was attacked very viciously\r\nBy those women.\r\n\r\nAnalysis by American voters: Ho-hum! What do we care if Trump attacks women, \r\nthen shames and blames his victims? Ho-hum!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToup\xe9e or Not Toup\xe9e, That is the Question\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch aka The Loyal Opposition\r\n\r\nThere once was a brash billionaire\r\nwho couldn\'t afford decent hair.\r\nVexed voters agreed:\r\nWe\'re a nation in need!\r\nBut toup\xe9e the price, do we dare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToup\xe9e or Not Toup\xe9e, This is the Answer\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch aka The Loyal Opposition\r\n\r\nOh crap, we elected Trump prez!\r\nNow he\'s Simon: we must do what he sez!\r\nFor if anyone thinks\r\nAnd says his plan stinks,\r\nHe\'ll wig out \'neath that weird orange fez!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite as a Sheet\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch aka The Loyal Opposition\r\n\r\nDonald Trump had a real Twitter Scare\r\nthen rushed off to fret, vent and share:\r\n\x93How dare Bernie quote\r\nwhat I justsaidandwrote?\r\nLike Megyn he\x92s mean, cruel, unfair!\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTangled Webs\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch aka The Loyal Opposition\r\n\r\nOh, what tangled webs they weave\r\nwhen Trump and his toup\xe9e seek to deceive!\r\n\r\nAccording to Trump, it is very legal and very cool to lie through his teeth \r\nto the American public, Congress and the FBI. While campaigning and since being \r\nelected president, Trump has repeatedly said things like: I have\r\nno deals with Russia. I have\r\nno dealings with Russia. I have\r\nno deals that could happen in \r\nRussia, because we\'ve stayed away. What do I know about Russia? Ihave\r\nnothing to do with Russia.I \r\npromise you I\'ve never made ... I don\'t have any \r\ndeals with Russia. I had Miss Universe there a couple of years \r\nago other than that no. I had nothing \r\nto do [with Russia]. Like most liars, Trump can\'t keep his story straight. In \r\nreality, he and his family were secretly meeting with Russian agents, making \r\nbackdoor deals, rigging the 2016 presidential election, and jeopardizing \r\nnational security by compromising themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxious Moments\r\n\r\nAnxiety hangs like a pall\r\nRound the world, as it grips one and all.\r\nOther nations ask why\r\nWe would vote for that guy.\r\n(I hear Canada\'s building a wall.)\r\nTim James\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would the price of a Trump presidency be, really?\r\nWould Donald Trump create an\r\n\r\nAmerican Holocaust by deporting 11 million people, including multitudes of \r\ncompletely innocent children and their mothers and fathers? Is Trump the second coming of \r\nAdolph Hitler? Yes, nicknames like Hair Hitler and Hair \r\nFuror are amusing, but are they also accurate, and perhaps prophetic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrumping the Truth\r\n\r\nWith their lies, guys like Donald Trump try us.\r\nProve them wrong, they just laugh and defy us.\r\nThey keep getting their way\r\nCuz there\x92s NO price to pay.\r\nCall them out?

Trump\'s outrageous \r\nbehavior was a running joke among alpha males in his circle. In 1993, fellow bad \r\nboy Howard Stern asked Trump directly: \x93So you treat women with respect?\x94 Trump \r\nanswered honestly: \x93No, I can\x92t say that either.\x94 And hundreds of chauvinistic \r\npublic statements and tweets by Trump confirm that he doesn\'t treat women with \r\nrespect, or minorities, or anyone that he considers weak or overweight or \r\nunattractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrumping Tots\r\nby \r\n\r\nMichael R.
