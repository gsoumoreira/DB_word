For instance, Robert Frost\'s The Road Not Taken was alleged to be a poem that deals with \nthat big noble question of \'How to make a difference in the world?\' My \nimpression of Frost\'s famous poem is that choices we make today are not \neasily reversed because way leads on to way and we don\'t have time to \nfully explore \nevery inviting path we encounter. Another nominee, William Blake\'s The Tyger, \nseemed like a reasonable choice but the spelling had \nbeen modernized to The Tiger. Isn\'t that sacrilege? Other choices made no \nsense to me: The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus, Daffodils by William \nWordsworth, On His Blindness by John Milton, and A Psalm of Life by Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow. Fine poems, yes. Well-known and highly-regarded poems, \nyes. But Milton, Wordsworth and Longfellow wrote greater poems, in my opinion. \nHow can a poem be one of the top ten of all time, if the poet has written \nsomething better that\'s not included? Why not Ode: Intimations of Immortality \nby Wordsworth, Paradise Lost by Milton, and The Jewish Cemetery at Newport \nby Longfellow? Lazarus was a commendable poet, but not a candidate for the top ten of all \ntime, in my opinion. Her poem is famous primarily because it became associated \nwith the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFinding myself annoyed, I thought I would take my own stab at identifying ten \ntruly great poems. I can\'t claim that these are the greatestperiod, \nexclamation pointbut these would be my picks if I were forced to live \nwith just ten poems for the rest of eternity ...\n\nAnd so, in one person\'s opinion, for \nwhatever it\'s worth, these are the ten most beautiful poems in the English \nlanguage ...\n\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\npass into nothingness ...\nJohn Keats\n\n... but before I reveal my personal choices for the top ten English poems of all \ntime, please allow me to cite a more democratic source. These are Google\'s top \nten results for the best poems of all time: \n\nSonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a summer\'s day?) by William Shakespeare, \nThe Road Not Taken by Robert Frost, She Walks in Beauty (Like the Night) by Lord Byron, \nDo Not Go Gentle Into \nThat Good Night by Dylan Thomas, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. \nEliot, The Tyger by William Blake, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost, The Raven by \nEdgar Allan Poe, Dulce Et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen, Ozymandias \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley, Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold,\nA Red, Red Rose by Robert Burns, The Rime of the \nAncient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The \nHighwayman by Alfred Noyes, The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot\n\nThere are more than ten poems above because Google\'s taste in poetry \napparently changes over time. Google and I agreed on five poems for the top ten \n(underlined), although I cheated by picking more than ten. I believe all \nGoogle\'s choices are worthy. Of course Google\'s taste in poetry is merely a \nreflection of its users\' preferences, so I will venture that readers have better \ntaste in poetry than the experts sometimes give them credit for. And while \nsome experts might froth at the mouth about The Raven being included in a \nserious top ten, I think Poe\'s most famous poem is justly popular with readers \nas long as we take it for what it isa sort of madcap \nwaking nightmare with considerable doses of black humor and irony. I will also \ndefend the inclusion of The Highwayman because I consider it to be one of the \nmost musical poems in the English language, the best poetic ghost story, and one \nof the best story poems of any genre. \n\nWhere I will quibble with Google is its failure to include The Wilde Swans at \nCoole by W. B. Yeats, Requiescat by Oscar Wilde, The Snow Man by Wallace \nStevens, and some of my other personal favorites. \n\ncompiled \nby Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\n\nBefore I begin my countdown of the ten most beautiful poems in the English \nlanguage, I will invoke the Muse with my translation of an \nancient lyric by\nSappho of Lesbos:\n\nSappho, fragment 42\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nEros harrows my heart:\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains\nuprooting oaks.\n\nSappho was called the Tenth Muse by her ancient peers. The other nine Muses \nwere goddesses, so she was obviously held in very high regard! I think the \ninvocation of Love (Eros) is appropriate, because most of the poems in my top \nten involve love in one form or another. \n\n\n\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \nproper and sometimes violently homophobic. As a result, Wilde was sentenced to hard labor at \nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous for his \ndisdain for dull and dulling conformity, as a number of his witty epigrams attest. But the \nlovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that Wilde was also a true poet \ncapable of \ncreating timeless art. He wrote the poem for his sister Isola, who died tragically at \nage ten. For me, this is the most touching poem in the English language. \n\n(#1) Requiescat\nby Oscar Wilde\n\nTread lightly, she is near\nUnder the snow,\nSpeak gently, she can hear\nThe daisies grow.\n\nAll her bright golden hair\nTarnished with rust,\nShe that was young and fair\nFallen to dust.\n\nLily-like, white as snow,\nShe hardly knew\nShe was a woman, so\nSweetly she grew.\n\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\nLie on her breast,\nI vex my heart alone,\nShe is at rest.\n\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\nLyre or sonnet,\nAll my life\'s buried here,\nHeap earth upon it.\n\n\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne \n(pictured above) have left her almost as famous. Yeats\'s poem The Wild Swans \nat Coole is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \nlanguage.\n\n\n\n\n\n(#2)\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\nThe woodland paths are dry,\nUnder the October twilight the water\nMirrors a still sky;\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\nSince I first made my count;\nI saw, before I had well finished,\nAll suddenly mount\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\nAnd now my heart is sore.\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\nThe first time on this shore,\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\nThey paddle in the cold,\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water\nMysterious, beautiful;\nAmong what rushes will they build,\nBy what lakes edge or pool\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\nTo find they have flown away?\n\n\n\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most \nnotorious married couple in the annals of English poetry and Literature. He was a dashing romantic poet and \nheretic who wrote a tract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled \nfrom Oxford. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \nGodwin. Percy and Mary Shelley spent the summer of 1816 with Lord \nByron at his mansion in Geneva. It was at this time that Mary Shelley conceived the story that became her famous \ngothic novel Frankenstein. Six years later, her husband drowned at age thirty. Who knows what he would \nhave accomplished if he had lived longer? And yet despite his short time on \nearth, Percy Shelley is still considered to be one \nof the greatest English poets. Here is one especially lovely example of his \nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\n\n\n\n(#3) Music When Soft Voices Die (To \n) \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is one of the best villanelles in the English \nlanguage, and it remains one of the most powerful, haunting poems ever \nwritten in any language. \n\n(#4) Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWilliam Dunbar was one of the first great Scottish poets, and is also known for \nhis longer poem Lament for the Makiris (Lament for the Makers, or Poets). \n\n(#5) Sweet Rose of Virtue\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue. \n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \n\nConrad Aiken was one of the sweetest singers among American poets. \n\n(#6) Bread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\n\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels, which include the \nthen-infamous Lady Chatterley\'s Lover, but he was also one of the better \nearly modernist poets. \n\n(#7)\nPiano \nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nEdmund Waller is not as well-known today as he should be, but he wrote one of \nthe most beautiful poems imaginable ...\n\n(#8) Go, Lovely Rose\nby Edmund Waller\n\n Go, lovely Rose,\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\n That now she knows,\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\n\n Tell her that\'s young,\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\n That hadst thou sprung\nIn deserts where no men abide,\nThou must have uncommended died.\n\n Small is the worth\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\n Bid her come forth,\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\n\n Then die, that she\nThe common fate of all things rare\n May read in thee;\nHow small a part of time they share,\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\n\nWallace Stevens was such a superb poet that it\'s hard to pick between The Snow \nMan, Sunday Morning, The Idea of Order at Key West, and several other of \nhis major poems. \n\n(#9) The Snow Man \nby \nWallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\nVIII Excerpt from Sunday Morning\n\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\nOr old despondency of day and night,\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\n\nI have several ties for my number ten poem ...\n\n\n\n(#10) Song for the Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\n(#10) Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \nby Ernest Dowson\n\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\n\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\n\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\n\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\n(#10) La Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\nby T. S. Eliot\n\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \nLean on a garden urn \nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \nFling them to the ground and turn\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\n\nSo I would have had him leave,\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\nSo he would have left\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\nI should find\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\nSome way we both should understand,\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\n\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\nCompelled my imagination many days,\nMany days and many hours:\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\n\n(#10) The Garden\nby Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\n\n\nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth.\n\nIn her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\n(#10) Lullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\n(#10) The Death of a Toad\nby Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep monotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard daylight steer.\n\n(#10) To Earthward\nby Robert Frost\n\nLove at the lips was touch\nAs sweet as I could bear;\nAnd once that seemed too much;\nI lived on air\n\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\nThe flow of  was it musk\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\nDownhill at dusk?\n\nI had the swirl and ache\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\nThat when theyre gathered shake\nDew on the knuckle.\n\nI craved strong sweets, but those\nSeemed strong when I was young:\nThe petal of the rose\nIt was that stung.\n\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\nThat is not dashed with pain\nAnd weariness and fault;\nI crave the stain\n\nOf tears, the aftermark\nOf almost too much love,\nThe sweet of bitter bark\nAnd burning clove.\n\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\nI take away my hand\nFrom leaning on it hard\nIn grass or sand,\n\nThe hurt is not enough:\nI long for weight and strength\nTo feel the earth as rough\nTo all my length.\n\n(#10) Those Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\n\nSundays too my father got up early\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\nthen with cracked hands that ached\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\nwho had driven out the cold\nand polished my good shoes as well.\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\n(#10) A Noiseless Patient Spider\nby Walt Whitman\n\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\n(#10) Come Slowly, Eden\nby Emily Dickinson\n\nCome slowlyEden\nLips unused to thee\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\nAs the fainting bee\n\nReaching late his flower,\nRound her chamber hums\nCounts his nectarsalights\nAnd is lost in balms!\n\n(#10) Adlestrop\nbyEdward Thomas\n\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\nThe name, because one afternoon\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\n\nThe steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\nNo one left and no one came\nOn the bare platform. What I saw\nWas Adlestroponly the name\n\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\n\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\nFarther and farther, all the birds\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.\n\n\n(#10)\nA Red, Red Rose\n\nby Robert Burns\n\n\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\n\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\n\nLonger Poems\n\n(#10) After the Persian by Louise Bogan\n(#10) Voyages by Hart Crane\n\n(#10)\nThe Highwayman by Alfred Noyes\n(#10) Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen\n(#10) Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold\n\n(#10) Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray\n(#10) Paradise Lost by John Milton \n(#10) Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth and \nOthello by William Shakespeare\n(#10) Tom O\' Bedlam\'s Song by Anonymous\n\n\n\n\nHigh Honorable Mentions\n\n\n\nSylvia Plath was one of the first and best of the modern confessional poets. She \nwon a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life.\n\nWinter landscape, with rocks\nby Sylvia Plath\n\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\nplunges headlong into that black pond\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\n\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\n\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\n\n\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, \nmasturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. \nThe Truth the Dead Know\nby Anne Sexton\n\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\n\nGone, I say and walk from church,\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\n\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\nand we touch. In another country people die.\n\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\n\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\n\n\n\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) \n\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \nMillay\n\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \n\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\nI shall remember you with love, or season\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\nFor conversation when we meet again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was an English romantic poet, painter, illustrator \nand translator. He was also one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite \nBrotherhood. His art was characterized by sensuality and medieval revivalism. In \n1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal (pictured above), who became his model, his \npassion, and eventually in 1860, his wife.\n\nSudden Light\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \nI have been here before,\n\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\nI know the grass beyond the door,\n\nThe sweet keen smell,\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore. \nYou have been mine before,\n\nHow long ago I may not know:\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\n\nYour neck turned so,\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore. \nHas this been thus before?\n\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\nStill with our lives our love restore\n\nIn death\'s despite,\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more? \n\nDante Gabriel Rossetti\'s sister Christina was also a poet, and perhaps the \nbetter of the two. \n\n\nSong\nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\nWould it surprise you to know that one of the most beautiful (and saddest) poems \nin the English language was written by a child prodigy, Thomas Chatterton? \nAlthough his mother and family considered him to be slow, around age seven the \nyoung Chatterton discovered an ancient book with illuminated capital letters, \nand he suddenly became intensely interested, quickly learned to read, and then \nbegan writing poems! By age ten he was a published poet. But many of the poems \nhe wrote were in a medieval version of English, and no one would believe that a \nchild was capable of writing such poems. So he pretended to have found the \npoems of an ancient monk named Thomas Rowley. One thing led to another, and \nChatterton was accused of being a forger even though the poems were his \noriginal compositions! Spurned by stuffy literary types and unable to support \nhimself, but too proud to accept handouts, Chatterton committed suicide at age \n17. You can click on his hyperlinked name above to read the sad, lovely ballad \nbelow, and other poems that he wrote during his short, tortured life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong from \xc6lla: Under the Willow Tree, or, Minstrel\'s Roundelay\r\nby\n\nThomas Chatterton\r\n\r\n...\n\nSee! the white moon shines on high; \r\nWhiter is my true-love\'s shroud:\r\nWhiter than the morning sky, \r\nWhiter than the evening cloud: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\n...\r\n\nSir Thomas Wyatt has been credited with introducing the \nPetrarchan sonnet into the English language. Wyatt\'s father had been one of Henry \nVII\'s Privy Councilors and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII came to \nthe throne in 1509. Wyatt followed his father to court, but it seems the \nyoung poet may have fallen in love with the kings mistress, \nAnne Boleyn. Their acquaintance is certain, although whether or not the two \nactually shared a romantic relationship remains unknown. But in his poetry, Wyatt called \nhis mistress Anna and there do seem to be correspondences. For instance, this poem might well have been written \nabout the Kings claim on Anne Boleyn: \nWhoso List to Hunt\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\n\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \n\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \nresurrection. So perhaps after her betrothal to Henry, religious vows  \nentered into the picture, and left Wyatt out.\n\n\n\nElinor Wylie was famous during her life almost as much for her ethereal beauty \nand personality as for her melodious, sensuous poetry.\n\nCold-Blooded Creatures\nby Elinor Wylie\n\nMan, the egregious egoist\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\nImagines, by some mental twist,\nThat he alone is sentient\n\nOf the intolerable load\nThat on all living creatures lies,\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\n\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\n\nFor Her Surgery\nby Jack Butler\n\nI\nOver the city the moon rides in mist,\nscrim scarred with faint rainbow.\nTwo days till Easter.The thin clouds run slow, slow,\nthe wind bells bleed the quietest\nof possible musics to the dark lawn.\nAll possibility we will have children is gone.\n\nII\nI raise a glass half water, half alcohol,\nto that light come full again.\nInside, you sleep, somewhere below the pain.\nDown at the river, there is a tall\nghost tossing flowers to dark water\njessamine, rose, and daisy, salvia lyrata . . .\n\nIII\nOh goodbye, goodbye to bloom in the white blaze\nof moon on the river, goodbye\nto creek joining the creek joining the river, the axil, the Y,\ngoodbye to the Yes of two Ifs in one phrase . . .\nChildren bear children.

Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\nI am the swift uplifting rush\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\nI am the soft starshine at night.\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\nI am not there; I did not die.\n\nThis consoling elegy had a \nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \nthree. As far as we know, she had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \n\nHere is a printable version of\n\nMary Elizabeth Frye\'s Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep which is not \ncopyrighted and is thus in the public domain. \n\n\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\nTo continue reading more of the most beautiful poems of all time, \nplease click here: Poems \nby the Masters of English Poetry. \n\nOther notable beautiful poems of the English language include:\n\nDiamonds and Rust by Joan Baez\nI Walk the Line by Johnny Cash\nA Change is Gonna Come by Sam Cooke\nBlowin\' in the Wind by Bob Dylan\nStan by Eminem\nMan in the Mirror by Michael Jackson\nBeen to Canaan by Carole King\nImagine by John Lennon\nLet It Be by Paul McCartney\nI Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton\nWhen Doves Cry by Prince\nTears of a Clown by Smokey Robinson\nBorn to Run by Bruce Springsteen\nHeart of Gold by Neil Young\nin Just- by e. e. cummings\nsince feeling is first by e. e. cummings\n\nThe Darkling Thrush \nby Thomas Hardy\n\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\nby Ernest Dowson\nIt Is A Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free\nby William\nWordsworth\nSpring and Fall, to a Young Child\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\nThe Highwayman\nby Alfred Noyes\nAfter the Persian by Louise Bogan\nVoyages by Hart Crane\n\n\n\n\nForgetfulness by Hart Crane\n\nA Last Word by Ernest Dowson\nThe Old Lutheran Bells at Home by Wallace Stevens\nThe Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop\nSkunk Hour by Robert Lowell\nAfton Water \nby Robert Burns\nThe Light of Other Days \nby Tom Moore\nThe Negro Speaks of Rivers\nby Langston Hughes\nA Blessing\nby James Wright\nNaming of Parts \nby Henry Reed\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time by Robert Herrick\nSarabande On Attaining The Age Of Seventy-Seven\nby Anthony Hecht\nExile by Hart Crane\nTime in Eternity by T.
