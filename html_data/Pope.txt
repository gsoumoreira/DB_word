Burch, an editor and publisher of Holocaust poetry\n\nThis page contains poetry by and about famous Popes and Saints of the Catholic \nChurch. I have \ndecided to present both sides of the coin, allowing the Popes and Saints to speak \nin their own words, then \npermitting poets to ask such \ninteresting questions as: if God is all-powerful, and the Popes are men of \nfaith, why do they need bulletproof Popemobiles? Do they trust in God, really?\n\n\nOne of my favorite heretical poets is the Archpoet, a medieval Latin poet who \nwrote on the cusp of the first Inquisition, when to disagree with (or merely \nquestion) a Pope was to risk being burned alive. Please be sure to read the \nArchpoet\'s wonderful Confession, which appears toward the bottom of this page. \nMajor poets are also represented here, including Alexander Pope, A. E. \nHousman, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and William Blake (who was said to have seen and \ncommunicated with angels on a daily basis, but was no fan of religious orthodoxy). I have also included poems by \ncontemporary poets like Ann Drysdale, X. J. Kennedy, T. Merrill, Sharon Olds, \nJoe Ruggier and Joe Salemi.\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nKarol Jozef Wojtyla was an unknown Polish poet before he became world-famous as Pope John Paul II. Some of his \nearly poems appeared in Polish\njournals under the pseudonym Andrzej Jawien. His poetry was later collected and\npublished in The Place WithinThe Poetry of Pope John Paul II, with\ntranslations and notes by Jerzy Peterkiewicz.\n\nLines from Meditations on the Book of Genesis: at the Threshold of the\nSistine Chapel\nby Karol Jozef Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II)\ntranslation by Jerzy Peterkiewicz\nFrom dust you came, and to dust you shall return;\nWhat had shape is now shapeless.\nWhat was alive is now dead.\nWhat was beautiful is now the ugliness of decay.\nAnd yet I do not altogether\ndie,\nwhat is indestructible in me remains!\nWhat is imperishable in me\nnow stands face to face before Him Who Is!\n\nThese are nice lines, but on the other hand, how can a man who claims to be the Vicar of \nChrist be so profoundly lacking in wisdom that he tells human beings it\'s a sin to use condoms and other \ncontraceptives? To command teenagers not to use condoms is to condemn many of \nthem to harrowing deaths. Who are the Popes, to consign children to dust, before \ntheir time? And the ones who don\'t die prematurely may unwisely contribute to \nthe overpopulation of the planet, with all the suffering that entails. Here\'s a \nrejoinder of mine, on the subject:\n\nSimple Simon\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBe fruitful and multiply?\nGreat advice: for a fruitfly!\nBut for women and men,\nSimple Simon, say When!\n\nIn my poem, Simon is a pun, as the name of the first Pope was Simon Peter. But Simon Peter was married, so this begs the \nquestion: why are Roman Catholic priests required to remain celibate, if the \nfirst and greatest Pope was married? This question seems especially pertinent \ntoday because many children have been molested and raped by \nCatholic priests. Is priestly celibacy the wisdom \nof God or the folly of human religion?\n\nMore poems by and about Pope John Paul II appear later on this page.\n\nPope Benedict XVI\n\nHere\'s my translation of a poem written in German by Joseph Ratzinger, better \nknown to the world as Pope Benedict XVI:\n\nGott Allein Gen\xfcgt\nby Joseph Alois Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI)\n\nGott allein gen\xfcgt:\nWas das Herz auch sonst noch liebt,\nWas es sehnend will umfangen,\nWas es dr\xe4nget zu erlangen,\nIst von ihm ein Schimmer nur,\nDer uns weist auf seine Spur\nEr ist\xb4s, der Dies alles gibt:\nGott allein gen\xfcgt.\n\n\nGod Alone Is Sufficient\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\n\nGod alone is sufficient:\nWhat else the heart would also love,\nWhat it yearns to embrace,\nWhat it is driven to achieve,\nThese are merely intimations of Him,\nAre merely the spoor that point us toward Him \nHe is the One who gives everything:\nGod alone is sufficient.\n\nBut what sort of loving God refuses to speak to human beings personally, then \ndamns them to an eternal hell for not believing in Him? How is it possible \nfor human beings to love a God who is so petty, cruel and unjust? I find it \nimpossible to reconcile a God of love, wisdom, justice and compassion with a \npetty being who has eternal hissy fits if people don\'t believe in him, when he \nis either unable or unwilling to communicate with them personally. If God loves \nhuman beings and wants them to believe in him, why doesn\'t he just say Hello? \nIf he doesn\'t speak to people, how can he fault them for not believing in \nhim? Is God irrational, or is it the religion that\'s nuttier than a fruitcake? \nAnd while the Popes claim there are rewards for pursuing God, poets like \nHillaire Belloc are not so sure:\n\nIs there any reward?\nby Hillaire Belloc\n\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\nI am broken and bored,\nIs there any reward\nReassure me, Good Lord,\nAnd inform me about it.\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\n\nPerhaps the only possible reasonable, compassionate reactions to the good news of \nChristianity are despair and foxhole humor. In the poem above, Belloc resorts to wry good humor.\n\n\nMy main complaint against Ratzinger/Benedict (very interesting names, for a man \nwho claims to be the Vicar of Christ) is that he has yet to excommunicate a \nsingle pedophile from the ranks of Catholic priests, and yet he continues to \nexcommunicate Catholics who are trying to do good things in the world, such as \nwomen who offer the sacraments. Which is worse, a woman who offers the \nsacraments, or a man who rapes innocent children? How can anyone believe that \nRatzinger/Benedict is capable of speaking infallibly, when he doesn\'t know the \nfirst thing about compassion or justice?\n\nTea at the Palaz of Hoon\nby \nWallace Stevens\n\nNot less because in purple I descended\nThe western day through what you called\nThe loneliest air, not less was I myself.\n\nWhat was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?\nWhat were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?\nWhat was the sea whose tide swept through me there?\n\nOut of my mind the golden ointment rained,\nAnd my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.\nI was myself the compass of that sea:\n\nI was the world in which I walked, and what I saw\nOr heard or felt came not but from myself;\nAnd there I found myself more truly and more strange.\n\nThis is an interesting poem because Wallace Stevens seems to have been an \natheist, and yet he wrote one of the most mystical poems in the English \nlanguage. Many people claim to have mystical experiences. Such experiences are \nnot exclusive to Christians. Yet according to Popes and Evangelists, only they \ncan go to heaven. But why would God reward men who are fiercely dogmatic, when \nother people are more tolerant and openminded? Does God love only close-minded \nthugs and churls? If so, how will heaven be heaven?\n\nAlexander Pope\n\nThe most famous Pope to write poetry was not a Roman Pontiff, but an English \nlayman: Alexander Pope. Alexander Pope was a major poet and \na wonderful epigrammatist:\n\nI am his Highness\' dog at Kew;\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\n Alexander Pope\n\nKings and Popes strive to make other human beings their obedient lapdogs. But are \nChristian parents wise to allow their children to be trained to jump through \nthe hoops of an unjust religion, like poodles? Alexander Pope\'s ironic lines question the \ndivine right of Kings and the self-appointed tyrants of organized religion: \nPopes, Cardinals, Bishops and evangelists like Billy Graham. What right do these \ntyrants \nhave to tell children that if they don\'t believe as they\'re commanded, they\'ll \ngo to Hell and suffer for all eternity? Could a loving, wise, just God have \nconcocted such a hateful, irrational, unjust religion?\n\nAn honest man\'s the noblest work of God.\n Alexander Pope\n\nAlexander Pope\'s epigram begs the question: are the Popes honest men, or do they \nplay loose, dangerous \ngames with the truth? The dogma of Hell is the perfect (or, more \ncorrectly, perfectly evil) example. According to the \nOld Testament a place called Hell and the possibility of suffering after death \nwere never even mentioned by God or his prophets. \nAnyone who has studied the Old Testament knows that hell was never mentioned to \nAdam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, \nJoshua, King David, Solomon, et al. Therefore Hell clearly did not pre-exist. \nBut there is no verse in the entire Bible in which the creation and \npurpose of hell were ever announced. (Hell just pops up in \nsome of the later-written \nbooks of the Bible like the weasel in the silly song.) But if the Bible is the \nrevelation of a loving, wise, just God, then surely he would have \nannounced the creation and purpose of Hell if he created it, along \nwith detailed instructions about how to avoid it. But he didn\'t. Obviously \nHell was invented by Christian theologians because it was very,\nvery good for \nchurch business. Later, long after the New Testament books had been canonized, the \nCatholic Church and its theologians would also invent Limbo out of thin air, \nsaying innocent babies unlucky enough to die without being splashed with magical \nwater by even-more-magical priests would be denied the grace of God, and thus \nentrance to heaven. But of course Jesus, Peter, Paul and the other apostles \nnever once mentioned the urgent need for newborn babies to be splashed \nwith water, in order to avoid eternal suffering. If Jesus was the Son of God, \nwhy didn\'t he know anything about Limbo, the need for infant baptism, or the \nmysterious age of accountability, which Protestants invented when they decided \nthey didnt\' need magical priests to keep babies from going to hell? And how can anyone believe in the \ninfallibility of Popes who invent places like Hell, Limbo \nand Purgatory, then use \nthem to cause Christian mothers two millennia of terrible emotional anguish, \nby making them believe such evil nonsense? What sort of \nGod punishes babies for dying before they\'re old enough to believe \nsuch sickening crap? (By the way, Pope Benedict now seems to be saying that Limbo doesn\'t \nreally exist, but then how can he explain 1,500 years of Catholic waffling on the \nissue, if hundreds of other Catholic Popes were able to speak infallibly and \nspare Christian parents so much anguish? Oh, what a tangled web we weave / when \nfirst we practice to deceive!)\n\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread.\n Alexander Pope\n\nPopes claim that God causes or allows unbaptized babies to suffer for all \neternity, in Hell or Limbo. Would any angel dare make such a terrible claim?\n\nOther Poets\n\nAre the Popes wise men, or fools and charlatans? They claim to represent an \nall-powerful God, but they ride around in bulletproof Popemobiles. They say God \nis loving, wise and just, but they also say that innocent babies who die \nunbaptized are in danger of places called Hell and Limbo, \neven though such infernal regions were never mentioned by the God of the Bible or \nthe Hebrew prophets. Here is a poem of mine about the strange, dark vision of \nGod created by his alleged representatives, the Popes and Evangelists:\n\nIn His Kingdom of Corpses\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to speak\nin many enraged discourses,\nhigh, high from some mountain peak\nwhere Hes lectured man on compassion\nwhile the sparrows around Him fell,\nand babes, for His meager ration\nof rain, died and went to hell,\nunbaptized, for thats His fashion.\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to vent\nin many obscure discourses\non the need for man to repent,\nto admit that hes a sinner;\ngive up sex, and riches, and fame;\nbe disciplined at his dinner\nthough always he dies the same,\nwhether fatter or thinner.\n\nIn his kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to speak\nin many absurd discourses\nof mans Ego, precipitous Peak!,\nwhile demanding praise and worship,\nand the bending of every knee.\nAnd though He sounds like the Devil,\nall religious men now agree\nHe loves them indubitably.\n\nOriginally published by The \nChimaera and \nLucid Rhythms\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that my poem is not about God, per se, but the strange, dark \nvision of an unjust God created by Christian theologians. If God is able to save \nhuman beings by grace, as Christian theologians avow, and if no human being is \nable to save himself, as they also avow, why would God save one human being at \nthe expense of another? If God is the only Savior, as the Bible constantly \nclaims, why doesn\'t God just save everyone? Human doctors and lifeguards don\'t \ncherry-pick one person to save, then throw away next one away as unworthy. Are \nhuman doctors and lifeguards more gracious than God?\n\nAre the Popes wise men, really? To me, the poets seem wiser. Here\'s a wonderfully ironic poem by one of the \nbest American \npoets. Should men beg God for forgiveness, or vice versa?\n\n\nForgive, O Lord\nby Robert Frost\n\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\n\nI find the poets to be far more honest and compassionate than allegedly \nChristian Popes, Evangelists and Theologians. Here\'s one of my \nfavorite poems by a contemporary poet who happens to be an atheist:\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby Tom Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\nAnd I find it ironic that one of the very best poems about Christianity in the English \nlanguage was written by an atheist:\n\nEaster Hymn\nby A. E. Housman\n\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\n\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\n\nAt least Housman didn\'t ask Jesus to save him by grace, while allowing the rest of \nsuffering mankind to burn in hell. Housman\'s non-faith seems better to me than \nthe dubious faith of the Popes and evangelical Protestants like Billy Graham, \nJerry Fallwell and Pat Robertson. How can anyone listen to them prattle on about \nother people going to hell, while they are saved by grace, without vomiting?\n\nOne of the very best poets on spiritual matters was William Blake, who was said \nto have seen angels on a daily basis. Blake had no sympathy for \nthe black-robed priests of organized religion, who erected a Thou Shalt Not \nsign over his Garden of earthly, sexual human Love:\n\nThe Garden Of Love\nby William Blake\n\nI laid me down upon a bank,\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\nI heard among the rushes dank\nWeeping, weeping.\n\nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\n\nI went to the Garden of Love,\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\nWhere I used to play on the green.\n\nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\n\nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\n\nHere\'s a wonderful poem by a contemporary poet who captures the dilemma children \nface when they\'re commanded to confess their sins to God and his devilish \nminions:\n\nFirst Confession\nby X. J. Kennedy\n\nBlood thudded in my ears. I scuffed,\nSteps stubborn, to the telltale booth\nBeyond whose curtained portal coughed\nThe robed repositor of truth.\nThe slat shot back. The universe\nBowed down his cratered dome to hear\nEnumerated my each curse,\nThe sip snitched from my old man\'s beer,\nMy sloth pride envy lechery,\nThe dime held back from Peter\'s Pence\nwith which I\'d bribed my girl to pee\nThat I might spy her instruments.\nHovering scale-pans when I\'d done\nSettled their balance slow as silt\nWhile in the restless dark I burned\nBright as a brimstone in my guilt\nUntil as one feeds birds he doled\nSeven our Fathers and a Hail\nWhich I to double-scrub my soul\nIntoned twice at the altar rail\nWhere Sunday in seraphic light\nI knelt, as full of grace as most,\nAnd stuck my tongue out at the priest:\nA fresh roost for the Holy Ghost.\n\nI have absolutely loved this poem by X. J. Kennedy since the day I first read \nit. In what dimension is eternal damnation a just recompense for boys being \nboys, and girls being girls? Only the witchdoctors (er, theologians) of \nChristianity could arrive at the dubious math of boy + girl = eternal \ndamnation, or\nboy + boy = eternal damnation, etc. But in any case, Joe Kennedy\'s poem \ncaptures both the spirit and the sense of a boy\'s First Confession, and his \ntruant tongue\'s triumphant revenge. His poem reminds me of the Archpoet\'s \nmagnificent Confession, which follows later on this page.\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nKarol Jozef Wojtyla was born in Wadowice, in an apartment that looked out on the\nChurch of Our Lady where he would later serve as an altar boy. His birthday was May 18, 1920, an auspicious day for modern Poles, now\nknown as the Polish Miracle. On that day, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski won a major\nbattle and seized Kiev from the Soviet Union. It was Poland\'s first major\nmilitary victory in over two centuries. Wojtyla\'s middle name was chosen by his\nfather in honor of Jozef Pilsudski. But Jesus renounced earthly power and \nriches, so why do Popes seek to accumulate earthly power and vast fortunes?\n\nLines from Meditations on the Book of Genesis: at the Threshold of the\nSistine Chapel\nby Karol Jozef Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II)It is here, beneath this wondrous Sistine profusion of color\nthat the Cardinals assemble\nthe community responsible for the legacy of the\nkeys of the Kingdom.\nThey come here, to this very place.\nAnd once more Michelangelo wraps them in his vision.\nIn him we live and move and have our being.\nThe colors of the Sistine will then speak the\nword of the Lord:\nTu es Petrus (Mt 16:18)once heard by Simon, son of John.\nTo you I will give the keys of the Kingdom.\nDuring the Conclave Michelangelo must teach them\nDo not forget: Omnia nuda et aperta sunt ante oculos Eius.\nYou who see all, point to him!\nHe will point him out \n\n\nAs everyone knows, the Catholic Church has great wealth and power. But Jesus \ntold the rich young ruler that if he wanted to be perfect, he should give \neverything he possessed to the poor and follow the example of Jesus, who died \nowning only the clothes on his back. So why do Popes sit on thrones, carry \nscepters and wear tiaras, while living on the tithes of the poor people who \nbreak their backs to support them? Are Popes exempt from the commandments of \nChrist, or do they not believe what they preach to other people?\n\nAnd what about the afflictions Popes and Evangelists heap on innocent children? This poem by a Catholic poet \nillustrates the terrible dilemma orthodox Christianity creates for innocent children:\n\nThe Missionary\'s Position\nby Joseph S. Salemi\n\nI maintain it all was for the best\nWe hacked our way through jungle and sought out\nThese savage children, painted and half-dressed,\nTo set their minds at ease, and dispel doubt.\n\nConcerning what? Why, God\'s immense design,\nAnd how it governs all we do and see.\nBefore, they had no sense of the divine\nBeyond the sticks and bones of sorcery.\n\nGranted, they are more somber and subdued,\nKnowing that lives are watched, and judged, and weighed.\nSubject to fits of melancholy mood,\nThey look upon the cross, and are afraid.\n\nWhat would you have me say? We preached the Word\nBetter endured in grief than left unheard.\n\nIs this what we want for suffering children? Heaven forbid that a child should \ntold by a Catholic, an evangelical Protestant, a Mormon, a Jehovah\'s \nWitness and a Muslim that he must believe in the correct religious dogma, or \ngo to hell. Various religious sects claim to hold the keys to heaven, \nbut as the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. How can anyone claim to \nrepresent a loving God, then present innocent children with infernal \ngospels that leave them eternally damned if they guess wrong? Should a child \nfacing starvation be accosted with the fear-inspiring image of an unjust, \nvengeful God who refuses to speak to human beings, then condemns them to eternal \nsuffering for not believing in him?\n\nOne of the most harrowing aspects of Christianity for children is the idea that \nsex is evil and that God demands that human beings refrain from sex (and even \nthinking about sex) until they are safely married. But this is patently \nridiculous, since children reach puberty around their early teens and won\'t \ngenerally get married until they\'re in their twenties or thirties. Is every \nyoung person who has sex, or who thinks about sex, in danger of Hell? Here\'s a \nwonderfully ironic poem on the subject by Sharon Olds, who in an interview with \nDwight Garner for Modern American Poetry mentioned growing up in a \nhellfire Episcopalian religion:\n\nThe Pope\'s Penis\nby Sharon Olds\n\nIt hangs deep in his robes,\na delicate\nclapper at the center of a bell.\n\nIt moves when he moves,\na ghostly fish in a\nhalo of silver seaweed,\nthe hair swaying in the dark and the heat\nand at night\nwhile his eyes sleep,\nit stands up\nin praise of God.\n\nSharon Olds explained the genesis of her poem as follows: I didn\'t understand, until years later, that this poem was kind of a return \ngesture. This man, the Pope, seemed to feel that he knew a lot about women and \ncould make decisions for us  various decisions about whether we could be \npriests or not, and who would decide whether we could have an abortion or not. \nHe had crossed our line so far  this is according to my outsider\'s point of \nview  that hey, what\'s a little flirtatious poem that went across his line \nsomewhat?\n\nHere\'s another poem on a similar subject by another contemporary poet, Ann \nDrysdale:\n\nWord Made Flesh\nby Ann Drysdale\n\n\nOn the broad steps of the Basilica\nThe feckless hopefully hold out their hands,\nOften with some success; the privileged\nLighten their consciences by a few pence\nOn their way to receive the sacrament.\n\nOn the seventeenth step two beggars sit\nPaying no regard to the worshippers\nWho file past on their way to salvation.\nThey do not ask for alms. They are engrossed,\nSkillfully masturbating one another.\n\nMost who have noticed this pretend they havent;\nSome of the other beggars wish they wouldnt.\nPoor relief is incumbent on the rich\nAnd by taking things into their own hands\nThey spoil the scene for everybody else.\n\nOur Lord said, silver and gold have I none\nBut such as I have give I thee. The words\nAre here made flesh; with beatific sigh\nOne gives the other benison, slipping\nAll that he has into the waiting hand\nOf somebody who shares his human need.\n\nThe newly shriven filter down the steps\nAverting their eyes from the seventeenth,\nWhere the first beggar, in a state of grace,\nWorks selflessly towards the second coming.\n\nI absolutely love Ann Drysdale\'s poem. If only there was a God whose grace \nextended to beggars masturbating each other on the steps of a \nBasilica! But then what use would there be for the hellfire-and-brimstone \ncondemners of humankind?\n\nThe problems with Christian theology are legion. For example, the Bible suggests \nthat man is responsible for suffering and death entering the world, due to the \noriginal sin and fall of Adam and Eve. But this makes no sense, because we \nnow know that trillions of animals suffered and died long before man ever walked \nthe planet, and even if the Bible\'s creation account was true, it makes no \nsense, because the animals didn\'t disobey God or obtain the knowledge of good \nand evil, and yet they still suffer and die. Here\'s a poem of mine on the \nsubject:\n\nWilly Nilly\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the Demiurge, aka Jehovah\n\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days uphilly.\nThey ran till they dropped\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nThey say I should worship you!\nOh, really!\nThey say I should pray\nso youll not act illy.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\nAnother problem for Popes and Christian theologians is the evil, absurd idea \nthat Jesus Christ will return to earth to become the greatest mass murderer in \nthe history of the planet:\n\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat would Santa Claus say,\nI wonder,\nabout Jesus returning\nto Kill and Plunder?\nFor hell likely return\non Christmas Day\nto blow the bad\nlittle boys away!\nWhen He flashes like lightning\nacross the skies\nand many a homosexual\ndies,\nwhen the harlots and heretics\nare ripped asunder,\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\nI wonder?\n\nOne thing that galls me about Christian theology is the bizarre idea that \nmiserly Popes and Christian theologians can be saved by grace, while \nhomosexuals can\'t. The following poem is from a collection of mine entitled Why \nI Left the Religious Right:\n\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insert\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insertand Hell is for Queers on the back of my shirt.\n And I uphold the Law,\n for Grace has a Flaw:\nthe Church must have someone to drag through the dirt.\nIve got ten thousand reasons why Hell must exist,\nand youre at the top of my fast-swelling list!\n Youre nothing like me,\n so God must agree\nand slam down the Hammer with His Loving Fist!\nFor what are the chances that God has a plan\nto save everyone: even Boy George and Wham!?\n Eternal fell torture\n in Hells pressure scorcher\nwill separate homo from Man.\nIm glad Im redeemed, ecstatic youre not.\nDid Christ die for sinners? Perish the thought!\n The good news is this:\n soon my Vengeance is His!,\nfor youre not the lost sheep He sought.\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nReturning to the poetry of the Popes ... I must confess that I like the poetry \nof Pope John Paul II best when he embraces humanity and puts aside highly \ndubious Christian theology:\n\nMaterial\n\nby Karol Jozef Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II)\n\n1\nListen: the even knocking of hammers,\nso much their own,\nI project on to the people\nto test the strength of each blow.\nListen now: electric current\ncuts through a river of rock.\nAnd a thought grows in me day after day:\nthe greatness of work is inside man.\nHard and cracked\nhis hand is differently charged\nby the hammer\nand thought differently unravels in stone\nas human energy splits from the strength of stone\ncutting the bloodstream, an artery\nin the right place.\nLook, how love feeds\non this well-grounded anger\nwhich flows in to people\'s breath\nas a river bent by the wind,\nand which is never spoken, but just breaks high vocal cords.\nPassers-by scuttle off into doorways,\nsomeone whispers: Yet here is a great force.\nFear not. Man\'s daily deeds have a wide span,\na strait riverbed can\'t imprison them long.\nFear not. For centuries they all stand in Him,\nand you look at Him now\nthrough the even knocking of hammers.\n\n2\n\nBound are the blocks of stone, the low-voltage wire\ncuts deep in their flesh, an invisible whip\nstones know this violence.\nWhen an elusive blast rips their ripe compactness\nand tears them from their eternal simplicity,\nthe stones know this violence.\nYet can the current unbind their full strength?\nIt is he who carries that strength in his hands:\nthe worker.\n\n3\n\nHands are the heart\'s landscape. They split sometimes\nlike ravines into which an undefined force rolls.\nThe very same hands which man only opens\nwhen his palms have had their fill of toil.\nNow he sees: because of him alone others can walk in peace.\nHands are a landscape. When they split, the pain of their sores\nsurges free as a stream.\nBut no thought of pain\nno grandeur in pain alone.\nFor his own grandeur he does not know how to name.\n\n4\n\nNo, not just hands drooping with the hammer\'s weight,\nnot the taut torso, muscles shaping their own style,\nbut thought informing his work,\ndeep, knotted in wrinkles on his brow,\nand over his head, joined in a sharp arc, shoulders and veins vaulted.\nSo for a moment he is a Gothic building\ncut by a vertical thought born in the eyes.\nNo, not a profile alone,\nnot a mere figure between God and the stone,\nsentenced to grandeur and error.\n\nThe Archpoet\n\nMy favorite poet on religious matters is the Archpoet, a medieval Latin poet. He wrote on the cusp of \nthe first Inquisition and was no fan of highly dubious Christian theology. His \nwonderfully heretical Confession should cause the Popes to reconsider their \nblasphemies, which turn God into the Devil:\n\nHis Confession\nby the Archpoet\n\n\ncirca 1165; translated from\nthe original Medieval Latin\nby Helen Waddell\n\n\nSeething over inwardly\nWith fierce indignation,\nIn my bitterness of soul,\nHear my declaration.\nI am of one element,\nLevity my matter,\nLike enough a withered leaf\nFor the winds to scatter.\n\nSince it is the property\nOf the sapient\nTo sit firm upon a rock,\nit is evident\nThat I am a fool, since I\nAm a flowing river,\nNever under the same sky,\nTransient for ever.\n\nHither, thither, masterless\nShip upon the sea,\nWandering through the ways of air,\nGo the birds like me.\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\nPrisoner to no key,\nQuesting go I for my kind,\nFind depravity.\n\nNever yet could I endure\nSoberness and sadness,\nJests I love and sweeter than\nHoney find I gladness.\nWhatsoever Venus bids\nIs a joy excelling,\nNever in an evil heart\nDid she make her dwelling.\n\nDown the broad way do I go,\nYoung and unregretting,\nWrap me in my vices up,\nVirtue all forgetting,\nGreedier for all delight\nThan heaven to enter in:\nSince the soul is in me dead,\nBetter save the skin.\n\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\nMaster of discretion,\nBut this death I die is sweet,\nMost delicious poison.\nWounded to the quick am I\nBy a young girl\'s beauty:\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\n\nHard beyond all hardness, this\nMastering of Nature:\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\nNear so fair a creature?\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\nHow should we obey it?\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\nShall they have no say int?\n\nSit you down amid the fire,\nWill the fire not burn you?\nTo Pavia come, will you\nJust as chaste return you?\nPavia, where Beauty draws\nYouth with finger-tips,\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\nRavished with her lips.\n\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\nIn Pavia dine him,\nNever more Hippolytus\nWill the morning find him.\nIn Pavia not a road\nBut leads to venery\nNor among its crowding towers\nOne to chastity.\n\nYet a second charge they bring:\nI\'m forever gaming.\nYea, the dice hath many a time\nStripped me to my shaming\nWhen an if the body\'s cold,\nIf the mind is burning,\nOn the anvil hammering,\nRhymes and verses turning?\n\nLook again upon your list.\nIs the tavern on it?\nYea, and never have I scorned,\nNever shall I scorn it,\nTill the holy angels come,\nAnd my eyes discern them,\nSinging for the dying soul,\nRequiem aeternam.\n\nFor on this my heart is set:\nWhen the hour is nigh me,\nLet me in the tavern die,\nWith a tankard by me,\nWhile the angels looking down\nJoyously sing o\'er me,\nDeus sit propitius\nHuic potatori.\n\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\nIn a tavern tankard\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\nBishop has decanted.\n\nLet them fast and water drink,\nAll the poets\' chorus,\nFly the market and the crowd\nRacketing uproarious.\nSit in quiet spots and think,\nShun the tavern\'s portal\nWrite, and never having lived,\nDie to be immortal.\n\nNever hath the spirit of\nPoetry descended,\nTill with food and drink my lean\nBelly was distended,\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\nMy cerebral story,\nComes Apollo with a rush,\nFills me with his glory.\n\nUnto every man his gift.\nMine was not for fasting.\nNever could I find a rhyme\nWith my stomach wasting.\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\n\'Tis a better chorus\nWhen the landlord hath a good\nVintage set before us.\n\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\nI myself betray me,\nAnd affirm myself to be\nAll my fellows say me.\nSee, they in thy presence are:\nLet whoeer hath known\nHis own heart and found it clean,\nCast at me the stone.\n\nJoe M. Ruggier\n\nBut rather than ending on a sour note, here\'s a closing poem by a Catholic poet \nwho suffered at the hands of Catholicism, and yet still found it in his heart to \nwrite in praise of Pope John Paul II:\n\nMan of Destiny\n\nan elegy for John Paul II\nby \nJoe M. Ruggier\n\nHe was mighty. He was stronga Super-Power ...\nHe was a Pillar of the Faith, a Tower.\nHe lasted longer than any Pope but two.\nHe rent the Iron Curtain, adored the Poor.\nHe adored Youth; Youth adored Him.\nHe honored Suffering. He was likewise gentle\nwith the ignorant ... yet He was worthy of the name\nof intellectual, man of letters.\nHe had mastered the Art of body-communication\narising from His genuine theatrical flair\na dramatist\'s unerring sense of timing\nconveying innermost Spirit through outward stance.\nHe was of all the Popes the most widely-traveled\nwith a reputation for building community\nwherever He landed ... His Parish the wide, wide Earth!\nHe honored five hundred Saints and thrice as many\nBeati, whose glorious ranks He yet may join,\nas Time confirms His Holiness ...\na total Man of colossal Honor and Integrity\nbreadwinner to all the Church. Yet He was gentle\nand forbearing with me, a total stranger:\nHe noticed my writings, however insanely busy ...\nand often sent me gracious acknowledgments\nthe last received mere days before He died.\nThe mere touch of His words, as of Christ\'s garment,\nwas enough ... allowing me to use Him to grow.\nHe bore my insults for the Gospel\nwith a genuine forbearance,\npassing them over with a heroic Silence\nand always pointing only to what was positive.\nMay His shining Spirit embrace and shield me always\nto inspire and to bless me and encourage me!\nMay the Father reward Him richly; the Son\nconfirm the task well-done; and may the Spirit\nspread His influence throughout the Ages\nthrough all the Saints He honored, as He tried hard\nto build bridges between Heaven and Earth.\n\nCopyright \xa9 Joe M.
