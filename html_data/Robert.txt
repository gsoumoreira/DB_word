When asked to name the \r\nsource of his greatest creative inspiration, Bob Dylan selected A Red, Red \r\nRose. (You can read Burns\' wonderful avowal of romantic love below, in both \r\nthe original and modernized versions.) Another Burns fan, Abraham Lincoln, \r\nrecited his poetry from memory and was perhaps influenced to emancipate \r\nAmerican slaves by the great Scottish poet\'s passionately-stated belief \r\nin human equality:\r\n\r\nThe rank is but the guineas stamp; \r\nthe mans the gowd [gold] for a \r\n[all] that!\r\nRobert Burns\r\n\r\nBurns, who made a living as a lowly tenant farmer or sharecropper, was saying that the common man is as good as any \r\nking, royal or lord. A \r\nman far ahead of his time,on the eve of the French Revolution, \r\nBurns was already writing The Rights of Woman (which appears on this page).\r\nBurns was called the people\'s \r\npoet among Russian peasantry for his pro-Everyman views; he  \r\nremains \r\nvery popular in Russia, where his poetry is still taught to students today.\r\n\r\nFor me, what shines through Robert \r\nBurns\'s poetry is his compassion for all living creatures: whether for a \r\nyoung girl accused of loose morals for embracing a boy in a rye \r\nfield, for a field \r\nmouse whose nest had been destroyed by his plow, for a daisy cut down \r\nbefore its time, or for himself when he had to part with someone he cherished.\r\n\r\nRobert Burns [17591796] is known as Bobbie Burns, Rabbie Burns, Scotland\'s \r\nFavorite Son, the Ploughman Poet, the Heaven-Taught Ploughman, Robden of Solway \r\nFirth, the Bard of Ayrshire and the National Poet of Scotland. In Scotland he is often called simply The Bard, as \r\nShakespeare is called The Bard in England. Burns, however, wrote in three \r\nlanguages: Scots, English and the Scots-English dialect for which he is \r\nbest known today. He even immortalized mice and insectslong \r\nbefore Walt Disney!as you can confirm by reading To a Mouse and To a \r\nLouse below. Poems by Burns also inspired the titles of two classic novels: John \r\nSteinbeck\'s Of Mice and Men and J .D. Salinger\'s\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye. A prolific songwriter, his version of Auld \r\nLang Syne is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year) not only in \r\nScotland, but around the world.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll take a cup o\' kindness yet, for auld lang syne.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\nBurns was also a pioneer of the Romantic movement, influencing major poets like \r\nWilliam Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley. He also became a source of inspiration to the \r\nfounding founders of democratic, liberal and socialist movements around the \r\nworld. Today,\r\nBurns is a national hero and a cultural icon in Scotland and \r\namong the global Scottish Diaspora. In 2009 he \r\nwas designated the Greatest Scot by a poll \r\nconducted \r\nby Scottish television channel STV. \r\nSir Walter Scott, the keen-eyed historian, once described the Ploughman Poet \r\nwith great admiration: His person was strong and robust; his manners rustic, \r\nnot clownish, a sort of dignified plainness and simplicity which received part \r\nof its effect perhaps from knowledge of his extraordinary talents. Burns died \r\nat age 37 after a dental extraction; his premature death makes his many \r\naccomplishments all the more impressive.\r\n\r\nThe best laid schemes o\' Mice an\' Men gang aft agley [go oft awry].Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose  \r\nOh, my love is like a red, red rose\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June: \r\nthat\'s newly sprung in June\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie and my love is like the melody\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune. \r\nthat\'s sweetly played in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass, \r\nAnd you\'re so fair, my lovely lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I; and so deep in love am I,\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear, that I will love you still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry. till all the seas run dry. \r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear, \r\nTill all the seas run dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun; and the rocks melt with the sun!\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,And I will love you still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.while the sands of life shall run. \r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!And fare you well, my only love!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!And fare you well, awhile!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,And I will come again, my love,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile! \r\nthough it were ten thousand miles!\r\n\r\n[Scottish songs] are, I own, frequently wild,  unreduceable to the more \r\nmodern rules; but on that very eccentricity, perhaps, depends a great part of \r\ntheir effect.Robert Burns\r\n\r\nThe poem "Comin Thro the Rye" by Robert Burns may be best-known today because of \r\nHolden Caulfield\'s misinterpretation of it in The Catcher in the Rye. \r\nIn the book, Caulfield \r\nrelates his fantasy to his sister, Phoebe: he\'s the "catcher in the rye," \r\nrescuing children from falling from a cliff. Phoebe corrects him, pointing out \r\nthat poem is not about a "catcher" in the rye, but about a girl who has met someone in the \r\nrye for a kiss (or more), got her underclothes wet (not for the first time), and is dragging her way back \r\nto a polite (i.e., Puritanical) society that despises\r\ngirls who are easy. Robert Burns, an honest man, was exhibiting empathy \r\nfor girls who were castigated for doing what all the boys and men longed \r\nto do themselves. \r\n\r\nComin Thro the Rye\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nO, Jenny\'s a\' weet, poor body, Oh, Jenny\'s all wet, poor body,\r\nJenny\'s seldom dry; Jenny\'s seldom dry;\r\nShe draigl\'t a\' her petticoattie She\'s draggin\' all her petticoats\r\nComin thro\' the rye.

The poem To a Louse resulted from his observations. The poor woman had no idea that she would be the \r\nsubject of one of Burns\' best poems about how we see ourselves, compared to how other \r\npeople see us at our worst moments. \r\n\r\nTo a Louse\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R.

And even devotion!\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nO wad some Power the giftie gie us, to see oursels as \r\nithers see us!Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns recognized man\'s inhumanity to his brothers and sisters, as well as to \r\nother creatures. But he also relished man\'s finer creations ...\r\n\r\nThere is a certain something in the old Scotch songs, \r\na wild happiness of thought and expression.Robert Burns\r\n\r\nA friend of Burns explains how he came to immortalize a lowly field  mouse: This beautiful poem was imagined while the poet was \r\nholding the plough, on the farm of Mossgiel: the field is still pointed out, and \r\na man called Blane is still living, who says he was gaudsman to the bard at the \r\ntime, and chased the mouse with the plough-pettle, for which he was rebuked by \r\nhis young master, who inquired what harm the poor mouse had done him. In the \r\nnight that followed, Burns awoke his gaudsman, who was in the same bed with him, \r\nrecited the poem as it now stands, and said, \'What think you of our mouse now?\'\r\n\r\nTo a Mouse\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWee, sleeket, cowran, tim\'rous beastie,Sleek, tiny, timorous, cowering \r\nbeast,\r\nO, what panic\'s in thy breastie!why\'s such panic in your \r\nbreast?\r\nThou need na start awa sae hasty,Why dash away, so \r\nquick, so rash,Wi\' \r\nbickering brattle! in a frenzied flash\r\nI wad be laith to rin an\' chase thee,when \r\nI would be loath to run \r\nafter you\r\nWi\' murd\'ring pattle! with a murderous plowstaff!\r\n\r\nI\'m truly sorry Man\'s dominionI\'m truly sorry Man\'s dominion\r\nHas broken Nature\'s social union, has broken Nature\'s social union,\r\nAn\' justifies that ill opinion,and justifies that bad \r\nopinion\r\nWhich makes thee startle, which makes you startle,\r\nAt me, thy poor, earth-born companion,when I\'m your poor, earth-born \r\ncompanion\r\nAn\' fellow-mortal! and fellow mortal! \r\n\r\nI doubt na, whyles, but thou may thieve;I have no doubt you sometimes \r\nthieve;\r\nWhat then? poor beastie, thou maun live!What of it, friend?

To critics who object to variations from the original \r\ntexts, my response is that there are often substantial disagreements among even \r\nthe most accomplished translators. Variations begin with the \r\nreadings because different people get different things from \r\ndifferent poems. And a strict word-for-word translation will seldom, if ever, \r\nresult in poetry. In my opinion translation is much closer to an art than a \r\nperfect science and I side with Rabindranath Tagore, who said he needed some \r\nleeway in order to produce poetry in another language when he translated his own \r\npoems into English.MRB\r\n\r\nAuld Lange Syne\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\r\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\r\nAnd never brought to min?\r\nAnd never brought to mind?\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\r\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\r\nAnd days o lang syne?\r\nAnd days for which we pine?\r\n\r\nFor auld lang syne, my jo,\r\nFor times we shared, my darling,\r\nFor auld lang syne,\r\n\r\nDays passed, once yours and mine,\r\nWell take a cup o kindness yet,\r\n\r\nWell raise a cup of kindness yet,\r\nFor auld lang syne!\r\n\r\nTo those fond-remembered times! \r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered just exactly what you\'re singing?\r\nAuld lang syne \r\nmeans something like times gone by or times long since passed and in the \r\ncontext of the song means something like times long since passed that we \r\nshared together and now remember fondly. In my translation, which is\r\nnot \r\nword-for-word, I try to communicate what I believe Burns was trying to \r\ncommunicate: raising a toast to fond recollections of times shared in the past. \r\n\r\n\r\nBanks of Doon\r\nby Robert Burns\r\nmodern English translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOh, banks and hills of lovely Doon, \r\nYe banks and braes o\' bonnie Doon,\r\nHow can you bloom so fresh and fair; \r\nHow can ye bloom sae fresh and fair;\r\nHow can you chant, diminutive birds, \r\nHow can ye chant, ye little birds,\r\nWhen I\'m so weary, full of care! \r\nAnd I sae weary, fu\' o\' care!\r\nYou\'ll break my heart, small warblers,  Thou\'lt break my heart, thou warbling bird,\r\nFlittering through the flowering thorn:\r\nThat wantons thro\' the flowering thorn:\r\nReminding me of long-lost joys,\r\nThou minds me o\' departed joys,\r\nDepartednever to return!\r\nDepartednever to return!\r\n\r\nI\'ve often wandered lovely Doon,\r\nAft hae I rov\'d by bonnie Doon,\r\nTo see the rose and woodbine twine;\r\nTo see the rose and woodbine twine;\r\nAnd as the lark sang of its love,\r\nAnd ilka bird sang o\' its luve,\r\nJust as fondly, I sang of mine.\r\nAnd fondly sae did I o\' mine.\r\nThen gaily-hearted I plucked a rose,\r\nWi\' lightsome heart I pu\'d a rose,\r\nSo fragrant upon its thorny tree;\r\nFu\' sweet upon its thorny tree;\r\nAnd my false lover stole my rose,\r\nAnd my fause luver stole my rose,\r\nBut, ah!, he left the thorn in me.\r\nBut, ah! he left the thorn wi\' me.\r\n\r\nThe heart benevolent and kind\r\nThe most resembles God.\r\nRobert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nBurns joined a dancing club at age 17, and a few years \r\nlater he co-founded the Tarbolton Bachelors Club. The rules stated: Every \r\nman proper for a member of this Society, must have a frank, honest, open heart; \r\nabove anything dirty or mean; and must be a professed lover of one or more of \r\nthe female sex. No haughty, self-conceited person, who looks upon himself as \r\nsuperior to the rest of the club, and especially no mean spirited, worldly \r\nmortal, whose only will is to heap up money shall upon any pretence whatever be \r\nadmitted. The club became the inspiration for hundreds of Burns clubs \r\naround the world, where poetry and ribald songs are chased with shots of good \r\nScotch whiskey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfton Water\r\n\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\r\nFlow gently, I\'ll sing thee a song in thy praise;\r\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\r\nThou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro\' the glen,\r\nYe wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,\r\nThou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,\r\nI charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.\r\nHow lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills,\r\nFar mark\'d with the courses of clear winding rills;\r\nThere daily I wander as noon rises high,\r\nMy flocks and my Mary\'s sweet cot in my eye.\r\nHow pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,\r\nWhere wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;\r\nThere oft, as mild Ev\'ning sweeps over the lea,\r\nThe sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.\r\nThy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,\r\nAnd winds by the cot where my Mary resides,\r\nHow wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,\r\nAs gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave.\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\r\nFlow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;\r\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\r\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\r\n\r\nThe poem above reminds me of Edmund Spenser\'s lovely poem Prothalamion, which \r\nhe wrote for his bride-to-be for their wedding in 1594. Spenser\'s river was the \r\nThames and his refrain was Sweet Thames run softly, till I end my Song. I\'m sure that Burns had read Spenser\'s poem, and I suspect that he may \r\nhave been influenced by it, if not inspired by it. \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nI pick my favourite quotations and store them in my mind as ready armour, \r\noffensive or defensive, amid the struggle of this turbulent existence.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nAe Fond Kiss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAe fond kiss, and then we sever;   \r\nAe fareweel, alas, for ever!   \r\nDeep in heart-wrung tears I\'ll pledge thee,\r\n  \r\nWarring sighs and groans I\'ll wage thee!\r\n  \r\n \r\nWho shall say that Fortune grieves him \r\nWhile the star of hope she leaves him?\r\n  \r\nMe, nae cheerfu\' twinkle lights me,\r\n  \r\nDark despair around benights me.   \r\n \r\nI\'ll ne\'er blame my partial fancy;   \r\nNaething could resist my Nancy;\r\nBut to see her was to love her,   \r\nLove but her, and love for ever.   \r\n \r\nHad we never loved sae kindly,   \r\nHad we never loved sae blindly,   \r\nNever metor never parted,\r\nWe had ne\'er been broken-hearted.   \r\n \r\nFare thee weel, thou first and fairest!\r\n  \r\nFare thee weel, thou best and dearest!\r\n  \r\nThine be ilka joy and treasure,   \r\nPeace, enjoyment, love, and pleasure!\r\n \r\nAe fond kiss, and then we sever!   \r\nAe fareweel, alas, for ever!   \r\nDeep in heart-wrung tears I\'ll pledge thee,\r\n  \r\nWarring sighs and groans I\'ll wage thee!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nThe wisest man the warl [world] eer saw, he dearly lovd the lasses, O. \r\n[Solomon had hundreds of wives and concubines]Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the Scotch phrase, Burns writes to Mrs. \r\nDunlop, Auld lang syne, exceedingly expressive? There is an old song and \r\ntune which has often thrilled through my soul: I shall give you the verses on \r\nthe other sheet. Light be the turf on the breast of the heaven-inspired poet who \r\ncomposed this glorious fragment. The following song, says the poet, when he \r\ncommunicated it to George Thomson, an old song of the olden times, and which \r\nhas never been in print, nor even in manuscript, until I took it down from an \r\nold mans singing, is enough to recommend any air. These are strong words, but \r\nthere can be no doubt that, save for a line or two, we owe the song to no other \r\nminstrel than minstrel Burns.\r\n\r\nAuld Lange Syne\r\n\r\n\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\r\nAnd never brought to min?\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\r\nAnd days o lang syne?\r\n\r\nFor auld lang syne, my jo,\r\nFor auld lang syne,\r\nWell take a cup o kindness yet,\r\nFor auld lang syne!\r\n\r\n\r\nWe twa hae run about the braes,\r\nAnd put the gowans fine;\r\nBut weve wanderd mony a weary foot,\r\nSin auld lang syne.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nWe twa hae paidlt i the burn,\r\nFrae mornin sun till dine:\r\nBut seas between us braid hae roard,\r\nSin auld lang syne.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nAnd heres a hand, my trusty fiere,\r\nAnd gies a hand o thine;\r\nAnd well take a right guid willie-waught,\r\nFor auld lang syne.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nAnd surely yell be your pint-stowp,\r\nAnd surely Ill be mine;\r\nAnd well tak a cup o kindness yet,\r\nFor auld lang syne.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nThe Scottish word jo means sweetheart, darling or dear. Auld lang syne \r\nmeans something like times gone by or times long since passed and in the \r\ncontext of the song means something like times long since passed that we shared \r\ntogether and now remember fondly. \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nAffliction\'s sons are brothers in distress; a brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this noble lyric Burns has vindicated the natural right of his species. He \r\nmodestly says to Thomson, \'I do not give you this song for your book, but merely \r\nby way of vive la bagatelle; for the piece is really not poetry, but will be \r\nallowed to be two or three pretty good prose thoughts inverted into rhyme.\' \r\n Thomson took the song, but hazarded no praise.\r\n\r\nIs There, for Honest Poverty\r\n\r\nI.\r\nIs there, for honest poverty,\r\nThat hangs his head, and a that?\r\nThe coward-slave, we pass him by,\r\nWe dare be poor for a that!\r\nFor a that, and a that,\r\nOur toils obscure, and a that;\r\nThe rank is but the guineas stamp,\r\nThe mans the gowd for a that!\r\n\r\nII.\r\nWhat tho on hamely fare we dine,\r\nWear hoddin gray, and a that;\r\nGie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,\r\nA mans a man, for a that!\r\nFor a that, and a that,\r\nTheir tinsel show, and a that;\r\nThe honest man, though eer sae poor,\r\nIs king o men for a that!\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nYe see yon birkie, cada lord,\r\nWha struts, and stares, and a that;\r\nThough hundreds worship at his word,\r\nHes but a coof for a that:\r\nFor a that, and a that,\r\nHis riband, star, and a that,\r\nThe man of independent mind,\r\nHe looks and laughs at a that.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nA king can make a belted knight,\r\nA marquis, duke, and a that,\r\nBut an honest mans aboon his might,\r\nGuid faith, he maunna fa that!\r\nFor a that, and a that,\r\nTheir dignities, and a that,\r\nThe pith o sense, and pride o worth,\r\nAre higher ranks than a that.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nThen let us pray that come it may\r\nAs come it will for a that\r\nThat sense and worth, oer a the earth,\r\nMay bear the gree, and a that;\r\nFor a that, and a that,\r\nIts comin yet for a that,\r\nThat man to man, the warld oer,\r\nShall brothers be for a that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet them cant about decorum, who have characters to lose!Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nMan was made when nature was but an apprentice; but \r\nwoman is the last and most perfect work of nature, says an old writer, in a \r\nrare old book: a passage which expresses the sentiment of Burns; yet it is \r\nall but certain, that the Ploughman Bard was unacquainted with Cupids Whirlygig, \r\nwhere these words are to be found.\r\n\r\nThere\'s Nought But Care\r\n\r\n\r\nTuneGreen grow the rashes\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\nGreen grow the rashes, O!\r\nGreen grow the rashes, O!\r\nThe sweetest hours that eer I spend\r\nAre spent amang the lasses, O.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nTheres nought but care on evry han,\r\nIn every hour that passes, O:\r\nWhat signifies the life o man,\r\nAn twere na for the lasses, O.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe warly race may riches chase,\r\nAn riches still may fly them, O;\r\nAn tho at last they catch them fast,\r\nTheir hearts can neer enjoy them, O.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nBut gie me a canny hour at een,\r\nMy arms about my dearie, O;\r\nAn warly cares, an warly men,\r\nMay a gae tapsalteerie, O.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFor you sae douce, ye sneer at this,\r\nYere nought but senseless asses, O:\r\nThe wisest man the warl eer saw,\r\nHe dearly lovd the lasses, O.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nAuld Nature swears the lovely dears\r\nHer noblest work she classes, O:\r\nHer prentice han she tryd on man,\r\nAn then she made the lasses, O.\r\n\r\nGreen grow the rashes, O!\r\nGreen grow the rashes, O!\r\nThe sweetest hours that eer I spend\r\nAre spent amang the lasses, O.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThere is no such uncertainty as a sure thing.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nHoly Willie\'s Prayer\r\n\r\nAnd send the godly in a pet to pray.  Pope\r\n\r\nOf this sarcastic and too daring poem many copies in \r\nmanuscript were circulated while the poet lived, but though not unknown or \r\nunfelt by Currie, it continued unpublished till printed by Stewart with the \r\nJolly Beggars, in 1801. Holy Willie was a small farmer, leading elder to Auld, a \r\nname well known to all lovers of Burns; austere in speech, scrupulous in all \r\noutward observances, and, what is known by the name of a \'professing Christian.\' \r\nHe experienced, however, a \'sore fall;\' he permitted himself to be \'filled fou,\' \r\nand in a moment when \'self got in\' made free, it is said, with the money of the \r\npoor of the parish. His name was William Fisher.\r\n\r\nO thou, wha in the heavens dost dwell,\r\nWha, as it pleases best thysel,\r\nSends ane to heaven, and ten to hell,\r\nA for thy glory,\r\nAnd no for ony gude or ill\r\nTheyve done afore thee!\r\n\r\nI bless and praise thy matchless might,\r\nWhan thousands thou hast left in night,\r\nThat I am here afore thy sight,\r\nFor gifts and grace,\r\nA burnin and a shinin light\r\nTo a this place.\r\n\r\nWhat was I, or my generation,\r\nThat I should get sic exaltation,\r\nI wha deserve sic just damnation,\r\nFor broken laws,\r\nFive thousand years fore my creation,\r\nThro Adams cause.\r\n\r\nWhen frae my mithers womb I fell,\r\nThou might hae plunged me in hell,\r\nTo gnash my gums, to weep and wail,\r\nIn burnin lake,\r\nWhar damned devils roar and yell,\r\nChaind to a stake.\r\n\r\nYet I am here a chosen sample;\r\nTo show thy grace is great and ample;\r\nIm here a pillar in thy temple,\r\nStrong as a rock,\r\nA guide, a buckler, an example,\r\nTo a thy flock.\r\n\r\nBut yet, O Lord! confess I must,\r\nAt times Im fashd wi fleshly lust;\r\nAnd sometimes, too, wi warldly trust,\r\nVile self gets in;\r\nBut thou remembers we are dust,\r\nDefild in sin.\r\n\r\nO Lord! yestreen thou kens, wi Meg\r\nThy pardon I sincerely beg,\r\nO! mayt neer be a livin plague\r\nTo my dishonour,\r\nAn Ill neer lift a lawless leg\r\nAgain upon her.\r\n\r\nBesides, I farther maun allow,\r\nWi Lizzies lass, three times I trow\r\nBut Lord, that Friday I was fou,\r\nWhen I came near her,\r\nOr else, thou kens, thy servant true\r\nWad neer hae steerd her.\r\n\r\nMaybe thou lets this fleshly thorn,\r\nBeset thy servant een and morn,\r\nLest he owre high and proud should turn,\r\nCause hes sae gifted;\r\nIf sae, thy han maun een be borne\r\nUntil thou lift it.\r\n\r\nLord, bless thy chosen in this place,\r\nFor here thou hast a chosen race:\r\nBut God confound their stubborn face,\r\nAnd blast their name,\r\nWha bring thy elders to disgrace\r\nAnd public shame.\r\n\r\nLord, mind Gawn Hamiltons deserts,\r\nHe drinks, and swears, and plays at carts,\r\nYet has sae mony takin arts,\r\nWi grit and sma,\r\nFrae Gods ain priests the peoples hearts\r\nHe steals awa.\r\n\r\nAn whan we chastend him therefore,\r\nThou kens how he bred sic a splore,\r\nAs set the warld in a roar\r\nO laughin at us;\r\nCurse thou his basket and his store,\r\nKail and potatoes.\r\n\r\nLord, hear my earnest cry and prayr,\r\nAgainst the presbytry of Ayr;\r\nThy strong right hand, Lord, mak it bare\r\nUpo their heads,\r\nLord weigh it down, and dinna spare,\r\nFor their misdeeds.\r\n\r\nO Lord my God, that glib-tongud Aiken,\r\nMy very heart and saul are quakin,\r\nTo think how we stood groanin, shakin,\r\nAnd swat wi dread,\r\nWhile Auld wi hingin lips gaed sneakin\r\nAnd hung his head.\r\n\r\nLord, in the day of vengeance try him,\r\nLord, visit them wha did employ him,\r\nAnd pass not in thy mercy by em,\r\nNor hear their prayr;\r\nBut for thy peoples sake destroy em,\r\nAnd dinna spare.\r\n\r\nBut, Lord, remember me an mine,\r\nWi mercies tempral and divine,\r\nThat I for gear and grace may shine,\r\nExcelld by nane,\r\nAnd a the glory shall be thine,\r\nAmen, Amen!\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nDare to be honest and fear no labor.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph on Holy Willie\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Richmond of Mauchline, that when he \r\nwas clerk in Gavin Hamiltons office, Burns came in one morning and said, \r\n\'I \r\nhave just composed a poem, John, and if you will write it, I will repeat it.\' He \r\nrepeated Holy Willies Prayer and Epitaph; Hamilton came in at the moment, and \r\nhaving read them with delight, ran laughing with them in his hand to Robert \r\nAiken. The end of Holy Willie was other than godly; in one of his visits to Mauchline, \r\nhe drank more than was needful, fell into a ditch on his way home, and was found \r\ndead in the morning.\r\n\r\nHere Holy Willies sair worn clay\r\nTakes up its last abode;\r\nHis saul has taen some other way,\r\nI fear the left-hand road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStop! there he is, as sures a gun,\r\nPoor, silly body, see him;\r\nNae wonder hes as blacks the grun,\r\nObserve whas standing wi him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour brunstane devilship I see,\r\nHas got him there before ye;\r\nBut hand your nine-tail cat a wee,\r\nTill ance youve heard my story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour pity I will not implore,\r\nFor pity ye hae nane;\r\nJustice, alas! has gien him oer,\r\nAnd mercys day is gaen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut hear me, sir, deil as ye are,\r\nLook something to your credit;\r\nA coof like him wad stain your name,\r\nIf it were kent ye did it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nFirmness in enduring and exertion is a character I always wish to possess. I \r\nhave always despised the whining yelp of complaint and cowardly resolve.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns took the hint of this Poem from the Planestanes \r\nand Causeway of Fergusson, but all that lends it life and feeling belongs to his \r\nown heart and his native Ayr: he wrote it for the second edition of his poems, \r\nand in compliment to the patrons of his genius in the west. Ballantyne, to whom \r\nthe Poem is inscribed, was generous when the distresses of his farming \r\nspeculations pressed upon him: others of his friends figure in the scene: \r\nMontgomerys courage, the learning of Dugald Stewart, and condescension \r\nand kindness of Mrs. General Stewart, of Stair, are gratefully recorded.\r\n\r\nThe Brigs of Ayr\r\n\r\nA POEM,\r\nINSCRIBED TO J. BALLANTYNE, ESQ., AYR.\r\n\r\nThe simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough,\r\nLearning his tuneful trade from evry bough;\r\nThe chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,\r\nHailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush:\r\nThe soaring lark, the perching red-breast shrill,\r\nOr deep-tond plovers, gray, wild-whistling oer the \r\nhill;\r\nShall he, nurst in the peasants lowly shed,\r\nTo hardy independence bravely bred,\r\nBy early poverty to hardship steeld,\r\nAnd traind to arms in stern misfortunes field\r\nShall he be guilty of their hireling crimes,\r\nThe servile, mercenary Swiss of rhymes?\r\nOr labour hard the panegyric close,\r\nWith all the venal soul of dedicating prose?\r\nNo! though his artless strains he rudely sings,\r\nAnd throws his hand uncouthly oer the strings,\r\nHe glows with all the spirit of the Bard,\r\nFame, honest fame, his great, his dear reward!\r\nStill, if some patrons genrous care he trace,\r\nSkilld in the secret to bestow with grace;\r\nWhen Ballantyne befriends his humble name,\r\nAnd hands the rustic stranger up to fame,\r\nWith heart-felt throes his grateful bosom swells,\r\nThe godlike bliss, to give, alone excels.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe snowdrop and primrose our woodlands adorn, and violets bathe in the wet o\' \r\nthe morn.Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Burns wrote these touching lines, he was staying \r\nwith Sir William Murray, of Ochtertyre, during one of his Highland tours. \r\nLoch-Turit is a wild lake among the recesses of the hills, and was welcome from \r\nits loneliness to the heart of the poet.\r\n\r\nOn Scaring Some Water-Fowl in Loch-Turit\r\n\r\nWhy, ye tenants of the lake,\r\nFor me your watry haunt forsake?\r\nTell me, fellow-creatures, why\r\nAt my presence thus you fly?\r\n\r\nWhy disturb your social joys,\r\nParent, filial, kindred ties?\r\nCommon friend to you and me,\r\nNatures gifts to all are free:\r\nPeaceful keep your dimpling wave,\r\nBusy feed, or wanton lave:\r\nOr, beneath the sheltering rock,\r\nBide the surging billows shock.\r\n\r\nConscious, blushing for our race,\r\nSoon, too soon, your fears I trace.\r\nMan, your proud usurping foe,\r\nWould be lord of all below:\r\nPlumes himself in Freedoms pride,\r\nTyrant stern to all beside.\r\n\r\nThe eagle, from the cliffy brow,\r\nMarking you his prey below,\r\nIn his breast no pity dwells,\r\nStrong necessity compels:\r\nBut man, to whom alone is givn\r\nA ray direct from pitying heavn,\r\nGlories in his heart humane\r\nAnd creatures for his pleasure slain.\r\n\r\nIn these savage, liquid plains,\r\nOnly known to wandring swains,\r\nWhere the mossy rivlet strays,\r\nFar from human haunts and ways;\r\nAll on Nature you depend,\r\nAnd lifes poor season peaceful spend.\r\n\r\nOr, if mans superior might\r\nDare invade your native right,\r\nOn the lofty ether borne,\r\nMan with all his powrs you scorn;\r\nSwiftly seek, on clanging wings,\r\nOther lakes and other springs;\r\nAnd the foe you cannot brave,\r\nScorn at least to be his slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nCritics! Appalled I ventured on the name: those cutthroat bandits in the paths \r\nof fame.Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castle of Taymouth is the residence of the Earl of \r\nBreadalbane: it is a magnificent structure, contains many fine paintings: has \r\nsome splendid old trees and romantic scenery.\r\n\r\nWritten with a Pencil, Over the Chimney-Piece, in the Parlour of the \r\nInn at Kenmore, Taymouth\r\n\r\nAdmiring Nature in her wildest grace,\r\nThese northern scenes with weary feet I trace;\r\nOer many a winding dale and painful steep,\r\nTh abodes of coveyd grouse and timid sheep,\r\nMy savage journey, curious I pursue,\r\nTill famd Breadalbane opens to my view.\r\nThe meeting cliffs each deep-sunk glen divides,\r\nThe woods, wild scatterd, clothe their ample sides;\r\nTh outstretching lake, embosomd mong the hills,\r\nThe eye with wonder and amazement fills;\r\nThe Tay, meandring sweet in infant pride,\r\nThe palace, rising on its verdant side;\r\nThe lawns, wood-fringd in Natures native taste;\r\nThe hillocks, dropt in Natures careless haste;\r\nThe arches, striding oer the new-born stream;\r\nThe village, glittering in the noontide beam\r\n\r\nPoetic ardours in my bosom swell,\r\nLone wandring by the hermits mossy cell:\r\nThe sweeping theatre of hanging woods;\r\nTh incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods\r\n\r\nHere Poesy might wake her heavn-taught lyre,\r\nAnd look through Nature with creative fire;\r\nHere, to the wrongs of fate half reconcild,\r\nMisfortunes lightend steps might wander wild;\r\nAnd Disappointment, in these lonely bounds,\r\nFind balm to soothe her bitterrankling wounds:\r\nHere heart-struck Grief might heavnward stretch her \r\nscan,\r\nAnd injurd Worth forget and pardon man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nSuspense is worse than disappointment.Robert \r\nBurns \r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Fontenelle was one of the actresses whom \r\nWilliamson, the manager, brought for several seasons to Dumfries: she was young \r\nand pretty, indulged in little levities of speech, and rumour added, perhaps \r\nmaliciously, levities of action. The Rights of Man had been advocated by Paine, \r\nthe Rights of Woman by Mary Wolstonecroft, and nought was talked of, but the \r\nmoral and political regeneration of the world.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF WOMAN.\r\nAN OCCASIONAL ADDRESS SPOKEN BY MISS FONTENELLE\r\nON HER BENEFIT NIGHT, NOV. 26, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Europes eye is fixd on mighty things,\r\nThe fate of empires and the fall of kings;\r\nWhile quacks of state must each produce his plan,\r\nAnd even children lisp the Rights of Man;\r\nAmid this mighty fuss just let me mention,\r\nThe Rights of Woman merit some attention.\r\n\r\nFirst on the sexes intermixd connexion,\r\nOne sacred Right of Woman is protection.\r\nThe tender flower that lifts its head, elate,\r\nHelpless, must fall before the blasts of fate,\r\nSunk on the earth, defacd its lovely form,\r\nUnless your shelter ward th impending storm.\r\n\r\nOur second Rightbut needless here is caution,\r\nTo keep that right inviolates the fashion,\r\nEach man of sense has it so full before him,\r\nHed die before hed wrong ittis decorum.\r\nThere was, indeed, in far less polishd days,\r\nA time, when rough, rude man had haughty ways;\r\nWould swagger, swear, get drunk, kick up a riot,\r\nNay, even thus invade a ladys quiet.\r\n\r\nNow, thank our stars! these Gothic times are fled;\r\nNow, well-bred menand you are all well-bred\r\nMost justly think (and we are much the gainers)\r\nSuch conduct neither spirit, wit, nor manners.\r\n\r\nFor Right the third, our last, our best, our dearest,\r\nThat right to fluttering female hearts the nearest,\r\nWhich even the Rights of Kings in low prostration\r\nMost humbly owntis dear, dear admiration!\r\nIn that blest sphere alone we live and move;\r\nThere taste that life of lifeimmortal love.\r\nSmiles, glances, sighs, tears, fits, flirtations, airs,\r\nGainst such an host what flinty savage dares\r\nWhen awful Beauty joins with all her charms,\r\nWho is so rash as rise in rebel arms?\r\n\r\nBut truce with kings and truce with constitutions,\r\nWith bloody armaments and revolutions,\r\nLet majesty your first attention summon,\r\nAh! \xe7a ira! the majesty of woman!\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nSuspicion is a heavy armor and with its weight it impedes more than it protects.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns was fond of a saunter in a leafless wood, when \r\nthe winter storm howled among the branches. These characteristic lines were \r\ncomposed on the morning of his birthday, with the Nith at his feet, and the \r\nruins of Lincluden at his side: he is willing to accept the unlooked-for song of \r\nthe thrush as a fortunate omen.\r\n\r\nSONNET,\r\nWRITTEN ON THE TWENTY-FIFTH OF JANUARY, 1793,\r\nTHE BIRTHDAY OF THE AUTHOR, ON HEARING A THRUSH SING IN A MORNING WALK\r\n\r\n\r\nSing on, sweet thrush, upon the leafless bough,\r\nSing on, sweet bird, I listen to thy strain:\r\nSee, aged Winter, mid his surly reign,\r\nAt thy blythe carol clears his furrowd brow.\r\n\r\nSo, in lone Povertys dominion drear,\r\nSits meek Content with light unanxious heart,\r\nWelcomes the rapid moments, bids them part,\r\nNor asks if they bring aught to hope or fear.\r\n\r\nI thank Thee, Author of this opening day!\r\nThou whose bright sun now gilds yon orient skies!\r\nRiches denied, Thy boon was purer joys,\r\nWhat wealth could never give nor take away.\r\n\r\nYet come, thou child of poverty and care,\r\nThe mite high Heaven bestowd, that mite with thee Ill \r\nshare.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nOpera is where a guy gets stabbed in the back, and instead of dying, he sings.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, when Burns was ill and seemed in slumber, he \r\nobserved Jessy Lewars moving about the house with a light step lest she should \r\ndisturb him. He took a crystal goblet containing wine-and-water for moistening \r\nhis lips, wrote these words upon it with a diamond, and presented it to her.\r\n\r\nTHE TOAST\r\n\r\n\r\nFill me with the rosy-wine,\r\nCall a toasta toast divine;\r\nGive the Poets darling flame,\r\nLovely Jessy be the name;\r\nThen thou mayest freely boast,\r\nThou hast given a peerless toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to min?\r\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot, and days o auld lang syne?Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns traced these words with a diamond, on the window \r\nof the Kings Arms Tavern, Dumfries, as a reply, or reproof, to one who had been \r\nwitty on excisemen.\r\n\r\nLINES WRITTEN ON A WINDOW\r\n\r\nYe men of wit and wealth, why all this sneering\r\nGainst poor Excisemen? give the cause a hearing;\r\nWhat are you, landlords rent-rolls? teasing ledgers:\r\nWhat premierswhat? even monarchs mighty gaugers:\r\nNay, what are priests, those seeming godly wise men?\r\nWhat are they, pray, but spiritual Excisemen?\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nNursing her wrath to keep it warm.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reproof was administered extempore to one of the \r\nguests at the table of Maxwell, of Terraughty, whose whole talk was of Dukes \r\nwith whom he had dined, and of earls with whom he had supped.\r\n\r\nTHE TOAD-EATER\r\n\r\nWhat of earls with whom you have supt,\r\nAnd of dukes that you dined with yestreen?\r\nLord! a louse, Sir, is still but a louse,\r\nThough it crawl on the curl of a queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nHope Springs Exulting on Triumphant Wing.Robert \r\nBurns\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARSONS LOOKS\r\n\r\nSome sarcastic person said, in Burnss hearing, that there was falsehood \r\nin the Reverend Dr. Burnsides looks: the poet mused for a moment, and replied \r\nin lines which have less of truth than point.\r\n\r\nThat there is falsehood in his looks\r\nI must and will deny;\r\nThey say their master is a knave\r\nAnd sure they do not lie.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN WITH A PENCIL,\r\nSTANDING BY THE FALL OF FYERS,\r\nNEAR LOCH-NESS\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many fine scenes, in the Celtic \r\nParnassus of Ossian: but when Burns saw it, the Highland passion of the stream \r\nwas abated, for there had been no rain for some time to swell and send it \r\npouring down its precipices in a way worthy of the scene. The descent of the \r\nwater is about two hundred feet. There is another fall further up the stream, \r\nvery wild and[150] savage, on which the Fyers makes three prodigious leaps into \r\na deep gulf where nothing can be seen for the whirling foam and agitated mist.\r\n\r\nAmong the heathy hills and ragged woods\r\nThe roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods;\r\nTill full he dashes on the rocky mounds,\r\nWhere, thro a shapeless breach, his stream resounds,\r\nAs high in air the bursting torrents flow,\r\nAs deep-recoiling surges foam below,\r\nProne down the rock the whitening sheet descends,\r\nAnd viewless Echos ear, astonishd, rends.\r\nDim seen, through rising mists and ceaseless showrs,\r\nThe hoary cavern, wide surrounding, lowrs.\r\nStill thro the gap the struggling river toils,\r\nAnd still below, the horrid cauldron boils\r\n\r\nA PRAYER IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH\r\n\r\nI have heard the third verse of this very moving Prayer \r\nquoted by scrupulous men as a proof that the poet imputed his errors to the \r\nBeing who had endowed him with wild and unruly passions. The meaning is very \r\ndifferent: Burns felt the torrent-strength of passion overpowering his \r\nresolution, and trusted that God would be merciful to the errors of one on whom \r\nhe had bestowed such oermastering gifts.\r\n\r\nO Thou unknown, Almighty Cause\r\nOf all my hope and fear?\r\nIn whose dread presence, ere an hour\r\nPerhaps I must appear!\r\nIf I have wanderd in those paths\r\nOf life I ought to shun;\r\nAs something, loudly, in my breast,\r\nRemonstrates I have done;\r\nThou knowst that Thou hast formed me,\r\nWith passions wild and strong;\r\nAnd listning to their witching voice\r\nHas often led me wrong.\r\nWhere human weakness has come short,\r\nOr frailty stept aside,\r\nDo Thou, All-Good! for such thou art,\r\nIn shades of darkness hide.\r\nWhere with intention I have errd,\r\nNo other plea I have,\r\nBut, Thou art good; and goodness still\r\nDelighteth to forgive.\r\n\r\nON THE BLANK LEAF OF A COPY OF MY POEMS, PRESENTED TO AN OLD SWEETHEART, THEN \r\nMARRIED\r\n\r\nThis is another of the poets lamentations, at the prospect of \'torrid climes\' \r\nand the roars of the Atlantic. To Burns, Scotland was the land of promise, the \r\nwest of Scotland his paradise; and the land of dread, Jamaica! I found these \r\nlines copied by the poet into a volume which he presented to Dr. Geddes: they \r\nwere addressed, it is thought, to the Dear E. of his earliest correspondence.\r\n\r\nOnce fondly lovd and still rememberd dear;\r\nSweet early object of my youthful vows!\r\nAccept this mark of friendship, warm, sincere,\r\nFriendship! tis all cold duty now allows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when you read the simple artless rhymes,\r\nOne friendly sigh for himhe asks no more,\r\nWho distant burns in flaming torrid climes,\r\nOr haply lies beneath th Atlantic roar.\r\n\r\nON SEEING\r\nA WOUNDED HARE\r\nLIMP BY ME, WHICH A FELLOW HAD JUST SHOT\r\n\r\nThis Poem is founded on fact. A young man of the name \r\nof Thomson told mequite unconscious of the existence of the Poemthat while \r\nBurns lived at Ellislandhe shot at and hurt a hare, which in the twilight was \r\nfeeding on his fathers wheat-bread. The poet, on observing the hare come \r\nbleeding past him, \'was in great wrath,\' said Thomson, \'and cursed me, and said \r\nlittle hindered him from throwing me into the Nith; and he was able enough to do \r\nit, though I was both young and strong.\'\r\n\r\nInhuman man! curse on thy barbrous art,\r\nAnd blasted be thy murder-aiming eye;\r\nMay never pity soothe thee with a sigh,\r\nNor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart.\r\nGo live, poor wanderer of the wood and field!\r\nThe bitter little that of life remains:\r\nNo more the thickening brakes and verdant plains\r\nTo thee shall home, or food, or pastime yield.\r\nSeek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,\r\nNo more of rest, but now thy dying bed!\r\nThe sheltering rushes whistling oer thy head,\r\nThe cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest.\r\nOft as by winding Nith, I, musing, wait\r\nThe sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn;\r\nIll miss thee sporting oer the dewy lawn,\r\nAnd curse the ruffians aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.\r\n\r\nWINTER,\r\nA DIRGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the earliest of the poets recorded compositions: it was written \r\nbefore the death of his father, and is called by Gilbert Burns, a juvenile \r\nproduction. To walk by a river while flooded, or through a wood on a rough \r\nwinter day, and hear the storm howling among the leafless trees, exalted the \r\npoets thoughts. \'In such a season,\' he said, \'just after a train of \r\nmisfortunes, I composed Winter, a Dirge.\'\r\n\r\nThe wintry west extends his blast,\r\nAnd hail and rain does blaw;\r\nOr the stormy north sends driving forth\r\nThe blinding sleet and snaw;\r\nWhile tumbling brown, the burn comes down,\r\nAnd roars frae bank to brae;\r\nAnd bird and beast in covert rest,\r\nAnd pass the heartless day.\r\nThe sweeping blast, the sky oercast,\r\nThe joyless winter day\r\nLet others fear, to me more dear\r\nThan all the pride of May:\r\nThe tempests howl, it soothes my soul,\r\nMy griefs it seems to join;\r\nThe leafless trees my fancy please,\r\nTheir fate resembles mine!\r\nThou Power Supreme, whose mighty scheme\r\nThese woes of mine fulfil,\r\nHere, firm, I rest, they must be best,\r\nBecause they are Thy will!\r\nThen all I want (O, do thou grant\r\nThis one request of mine!)\r\nSince to enjoy Thou dost deny,\r\nAssist me to resign!\r\n\r\nMAN WAS MADE TO MOURN, A DIRGE\r\n\r\nThe origin of this fine poem is alluded to by Burns in \r\none of his letters to Mrs. Dunlop: \'I had an old grand-uncle with whom my mother \r\nlived in her girlish years: the good old man was long blind ere he died, during \r\nwhich time his highest enjoyment was to sit and cry, while my mother would sing \r\nthe simple old song of \'The Life and Age of Man. From that truly venerable \r\nwoman, long after the death of her distinguished son, Cromek, in collecting the \r\nReliques, obtained a copy by recitation of the older strain.\r\n\r\nWhen chill Novembers surly blast\r\nMade fields and forests bare,\r\nOne evning as I wandered forth\r\nAlong the banks of Ayr,\r\nI spyd a man whose aged step\r\nSeemd weary, worn with care;\r\nHis face was furrowd oer with years,\r\nAnd hoary was his hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung stranger, whither wandrest thou?\r\nBegan the revrend sage;\r\nDoes thirst of wealth thy step constrain,\r\nOr youthful pleasures rage?\r\nOr haply, prest with cares and woes,\r\nToo soon thou hast began\r\nTo wander forth, with me to mourn\r\nThe miseries of man.\r\n\r\nThe sun that overhangs yon moors,\r\nOut-spreading far and wide,\r\nWhere hundreds labour to support\r\nA haughty lordlings pride:\r\nIve seen yon weary winter-sun\r\nTwice forty times return,\r\nAnd evry time had added proofs\r\nThat man was made to mourn.\r\n\r\nO man! while in thy early years,\r\nHow prodigal of time!\r\nMisspending all thy precious hours,\r\nThy glorious youthful prime!\r\nAlternate follies take the sway;\r\nLicentious passions burn;\r\nWhich tenfold force gives natures law,\r\nThat man was made to mourn.\r\n\r\nLook not alone on youthful prime,\r\nOr manhoods active might;\r\nMan then is useful to his kind,\r\nSupported in his right:\r\nBut see him on the edge of life,\r\nWith cares and sorrows worn;\r\nThen age and wantoh! ill-matchd pair!\r\nShow man was made to mourn.\r\n\r\nA few seem favorites of fate,\r\nIn pleasures lap carest:\r\nYet, think not all the rich and great\r\nAre likewise truly blest.\r\nBut, oh! what crowds in every land,\r\nAll wretched and forlorn!\r\nThro weary life this lesson learn\r\nThat man was made to mourn.\r\n\r\nMany and sharp the numrous ills\r\nInwoven with our frame!\r\nMore pointed still we make ourselves,\r\nRegret, remorse, and shame!\r\nAnd man, whose heaven-erected face\r\nThe smiles of love adorn,\r\nMans inhumanity to man\r\nMakes countless thousands mourn!\r\n\r\nSee yonder poor, oerlabourd wight,\r\nSo abject, mean, and vile,\r\nWho begs a brother of the earth\r\nTo give him leave to toil;\r\nAnd see his lordly fellow-worm\r\nThe poor petition spurn,\r\nUnmindful, though a weeping wife\r\nAnd helpless offspring mourn.\r\n\r\nIf Im designd yon lordlings slave\r\nBy Natures law designd\r\nWhy was an independent wish\r\nEer planted in my mind?\r\nIf not, why am I subject to\r\nHis cruelty or scorn?\r\nOr why has man the will and power\r\nTo make his fellow mourn?\r\n\r\nYet, let not this too much, my son,\r\nDisturb thy youthful breast;\r\nThis partial view of human-kind\r\nIs surely not the best!\r\nThe poor, oppressed, honest man\r\nHad never, sure, been born,\r\nHad there not been some recompense\r\nTo comfort those that mourn!\r\n\r\nO Death! the poor mans dearest friend\r\nThe kindest and the best!\r\nWelcome the hour, my aged limbs\r\nAre laid with thee at rest!\r\nThe great, the wealthy, fear thy blow,\r\nFrom pomp and pleasure torn!\r\nBut, oh! a blest relief to those\r\nThat weary-laden mourn.\r\n\r\nTO RUIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been, says Burns, in his common-place book, \r\ntaking a peep through, as Young finely says, The dark postern of time long \r\nelapsed. Twas a rueful prospect! What a tissue of thoughtlessness, \r\nweakness, and folly! my life reminded me of a ruined temple. What strength, what \r\nproportion in some parts, what unsightly gaps, what prostrate ruins in others! \r\nThe fragment, To Ruin, seems to have had its origin in moments such as these.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nAll hail! inexorable lord!\r\nAt whose destruction-breathing word,\r\nThe mightiest empires fall!\r\nThy cruel, woe-delighted train,\r\nThe ministers of grief and pain,\r\nA sullen welcome, all!\r\nWith stern-resolvd, despairing eye,\r\nI see each aimed dart;\r\nFor one has cut my dearest tie,\r\nAnd quivers in my heart.\r\nThen lowring and pouring,\r\nThe storm no more I dread;\r\nThough thickning and blackning,\r\nRound my devoted head.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nAnd thou grim powr, by life abhorrd,\r\nWhile life a pleasure can afford,\r\nOh! hear a wretchs prayer!\r\nNo more I shrink appalld, afraid;\r\nI court, I beg thy friendly aid,\r\nTo close this scene of care![97]\r\nWhen shall my soul, in silent peace,\r\nResign lifes joyless day;\r\nMy weary heart its throbbings cease,\r\nCold mouldring in the clay?\r\nNo fear more, no tear more,\r\nTo stain my lifeless face;\r\nEnclasped, and grasped\r\nWithin thy cold embrace!\r\n\r\nA WINTER NIGHT\r\n\r\nPoor naked wretches, wheresoeer you are\r\nThat bide the pelting of the pitiless storm!\r\nHow shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,\r\nYour looped and widowd raggedness defend you\r\nFrom seasons such as these?\r\nShakspeare\r\n\r\nThis poem, says my friend Thomas Carlyle, is worth several homilies on mercy, \r\nfor it is the voice of Mercy herself. Burns, indeed, lives in sympathy: his soul \r\nrushes forth into all the realms of being: nothing that has existence can be \r\nindifferent to him.\r\n\r\nWhen biting Boreas, fell and doure,\r\nSharp shivers thro the leafless bowr;\r\nWhen Phbus gies a short-livd glowr\r\nFar south the lift,\r\nDim-darkening through the flaky showr,\r\nOr whirling drift:\r\n\r\nAe night the storm the steeples rocked,\r\nPoor labour sweet in sleep was locked,\r\nWhile burns, wi snawy wreeths up-choked,\r\nWild-eddying swirl.\r\nOr through the mining outlet bocked,\r\nDown headlong hurl.\r\n\r\nListening, the doors an winnocks rattle,\r\nI thought me on the ourie cattle,\r\nOr silly sheep, wha bide this brattle\r\nO winter war,\r\nAnd through the drift, deep-lairing sprattle\r\nBeneath a scar.\r\n\r\nIlk happing bird, wee, helpless thing,\r\nThat, in the merry months o spring,\r\nDelighted me to hear thee sing,\r\nWhat comes o thee?\r\nWhare wilt thou cower thy chittering wing,\r\nAn close thy ee?\r\n\r\nEvn you on murdring errands toild,\r\nLone from your savage homes exiled,\r\nThe blood-stained roost, and sheep-cote spoiled\r\nMy heart forgets,\r\nWhile pitiless the tempest wild\r\nSore on you beats.\r\n\r\nNow Phoebe, in her midnight reign,\r\nDark muffled, viewed the dreary plain;\r\nStill crowding thoughts, a pensive train,\r\nRose in my soul,\r\nWhen on my ear this plaintive strain\r\nSlow, solemn, stole:\r\n\r\nBlow, blow, ye winds, with heavier gust!\r\nAnd freeze, thou bitter-biting frost:\r\nDescend, ye chilly, smothering snows!\r\nNot all your rage, as now united, shows\r\nMore hard unkindness, unrelenting,\r\nVengeful malice unrepenting,\r\nThan heaven-illumined man on brother man bestows;\r\n\r\nSee stern oppressions iron grip,\r\nOr mad ambitions gory hand,\r\nSending, like blood-hounds from the slip,\r\nWoe, want, and murder oer a land!\r\nEven in the peaceful rural vale,\r\nTruth, weeping, tells the mournful tale,\r\nHow pamperd luxury, flattery by her side,\r\nThe parasite empoisoning her ear.\r\nWith all the servile wretches in the rear,\r\nLooks oer proud property, extended wide;\r\nAnd eyes the simple rustic hind,\r\nWhose toil upholds the glittering show,\r\nA creature of another kind,\r\nSome coarser substance, unrefind,\r\nPlaced for her lordly use thus far, thus vile, below.\r\n\r\nWhere, where is loves fond, tender throe,\r\nWith lordly honours lofty brow,\r\nThe powers you proudly own?\r\nIs there, beneath loves noble name,\r\nCan harbour, dark, the selfish aim,\r\nTo bless himself alone!\r\nMark maiden innocence a prey\r\nTo love-pretending snares,\r\nThis boasted honour turns away,\r\nShunning soft pitys rising sway,\r\nRegardless of the tears and unavailing prayers!\r\nPerhaps this hour, in miserys squalid nest,\r\nShe strains your infant to her joyless breast,\r\nAnd with a mothers fears shrinks at the rocking blast!\r\n\r\nOh ye! who, sunk in beds of down,\r\nFeel not a want but what yourselves create,\r\nThink, for a moment, on his wretched fate,\r\nWhom friends and fortune quite disown!\r\nIll satisfied keen natures clamorous call,\r\nStretched on his straw he lays himself to sleep,\r\nWhile through the ragged roof and chinky wall,\r\nChill oer his slumbers piles the drifty heap!\r\nThink on the dungeons grim confine,\r\nWhere guilt and poor misfortune pine!\r\nGuilt, erring man, relenting view!\r\nBut shall thy legal rage pursue\r\nThe wretch, already crushed low\r\nBy cruel fortunes undeserved blow?\r\nAfflictions sons are brothers in distress,\r\nA brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!\r\n\r\nI heard nae mair, for Chanticleer\r\nShook off the pouthery snaw,\r\nAnd hailed the morning with a cheer\r\nA cottage-rousing craw!\r\nBut deep this truth impressed my mind\r\nThrough all his works abroad,\r\nThe heart benevolent and kind\r\nThe most resembles God.\r\n\r\nON\r\nTHE DEATH OF ROBERT DUNDAS, ESQ.,\r\nOF ARNISTON,\r\nLATE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the request of Advocate Hay, Burns composed this \r\nPoem, in the hope that it might interest the powerful family of Dundas in his \r\nfortunes. I found it inserted in the handwriting of the poet, in an interleaved \r\ncopy of his Poems, which he presented to Dr. Geddes, accompanied by the \r\nfollowing surly note:The foregoing Poem has some tolerable lines in it, but \r\nthe incurable wound of my pride will not suffer me to correct, or even peruse \r\nit. I sent a copy of it with my best prose letter to the son of the great man, \r\nthe theme of the piece, by the hands of one of the noblest men in Gods world, \r\nAlexander Wood, surgeon: when, behold! his solicitorship took no more notice of \r\nmy Poem, or of me, than I had been a strolling fiddler who had made free with \r\nhis ladys name, for a silly new reel. Did the fellow imagine that I looked for \r\nany dirty gratuity? This Robert Dundas was the elder brother of that Lord \r\nMelville to whose hands, soon after these lines were written, all the government \r\npatronage in Scotland was confided, and who, when the name of Burns was \r\nmentioned, pushed the wine to Pitt, and said nothing. The poem was first printed \r\nby me, in 1834.\r\n\r\nLone on the bleaky hills the straying flocks\r\nShun the fierce storms among the sheltering rocks;\r\nDown from the rivulets, red with dashing rains,\r\nThe gathering floods burst oer the distant plains;\r\nBeneath the blasts the leafless forests groan;\r\nThe hollow caves return a sullen moan.\r\nYe hills, ye plains, ye forests and ye caves,\r\nYe howling winds, and wintry swelling waves!\r\nUnheard, unseen, by human ear or eye,\r\nSad to your sympathetic scenes I fly;\r\nWhere to the whistling blast and waters roar\r\nPale Scotias recent wound I may deplore.\r\n\r\nO heavy loss, thy country ill could bear!\r\nA loss these evil days can neer repair!\r\nJustice, the high vicegerent of her God,\r\nHer doubtful balance eyd, and swayd her rod;\r\nHearing the tidings of the fatal blow\r\nShe sunk, abandond to the wildest woe.\r\n\r\nWrongs, injuries, from many a darksome den,\r\nNow gay in hope explore the paths of men:\r\nSee from this cavern grim Oppression rise,\r\nAnd throw on poverty his cruel eyes;\r\nKeen on the helpless victim see him fly,\r\nAnd stifle, dark, the feebly-bursting cry:\r\nMark ruffian Violence, distaind with crimes,\r\nRousing elate in these degenerate times;\r\nView unsuspecting Innocence a prey,\r\nAs guileful Fraud points out the erring way:\r\nWhile subtile Litigations pliant tongue\r\nThe life-blood equal sucks of Right and Wrong:\r\nHark, injurd Want recounts th unlistend tale,\r\nAnd much-wrongd Misry pours th unpitied wail!\r\n\r\nYe dark waste hills, and brown unsightly plains,\r\nTo you I sing my grief-inspired strains:\r\nYe tempests, rage! ye turbid torrents, roll!\r\nYe suit the joyless tenor of my soul.\r\nLifes social haunts and pleasures I resign,\r\nBe nameless wilds and lonely wanderings mine,\r\nTo mourn the woes my country must endure,\r\nThat wound degenerate ages cannot cure.\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE UNCO GUID,\r\nOR THE RIGIDLY RIGHTEOUS\r\n\r\nMy son, these maxims make a rule,\r\nAnd lump them ay thegither;\r\nThe Rigid Righteous is a fool,\r\nThe Rigid Wise anither:\r\nThe cleanest corn that eer was dight\r\nMay hae some pyles o caff in;\r\nSo neer a fellow-creature slight\r\nFor random fits o daffin.\r\nSolomon.Eccles. ch. vii. ver. 16.\r\n\r\nBurns, says Hogg, in a note on this Poem, has written more from his own heart \r\nand his own feelings than any other poet. External nature had few charms for \r\nhim; the sublime shades and hues of heaven and earth never excited his \r\nenthusiasm: but with the secret fountains of passion in the human soul he was \r\nwell acquainted. Burns, indeed, was not what is called a descriptive poet: yet \r\nwith what exquisite snatches of description are some of his poems adorned, and \r\nin what fragrant and romantic scenes he enshrines the heroes and heroines of \r\nmany of his finest songs! Who the high, exalted, virtuous dames were, to whom \r\nthe Poem refers, we are not told. How much men stand indebted to want of \r\nopportunity to sin, and how much of their good name they owe to the ignorance of \r\nthe world, were inquiries in which the poet found pleasure.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nO ye wha are sae guid yoursel,\r\nSae pious and sae holy,\r\nYeve nought to do but mark and tell\r\nYour neibors fauts and folly!\r\nWhase life is like a weel-gaun mill,\r\nSupplyd wi store o water,\r\nThe heaped happers ebbing still,\r\nAnd still the clap plays clatter.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nHear me, ye venerable core,\r\nAs counsel for poor mortals,\r\nThat frequent pass douce Wisdoms door\r\nFor glaikit Follys portals;\r\nI, for their thoughtless, careless sakes,\r\nWould here propone defences,\r\nTheir donsie tricks, their black mistakes,\r\nTheir failings and mischances.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nYe see your state wi theirs compard,\r\nAnd shudder at the niffer,\r\nBut cast a moments fair regard,\r\nWhat maks the mighty differ?\r\nDiscount what scant occasion gave,\r\nThat purity ye pride in,\r\nAnd (whats aft mair than a the lave)\r\nYour better art o hiding.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nThink, when your castigated pulse\r\nGies now and then a wallop,\r\nWhat ragings must his veins convulse,\r\nThat still eternal gallop:\r\nWi wind and tide fair i your tail,\r\nRight on ye scud your sea-way;\r\nBut in the teeth o baith to sail,\r\nIt makes an unco lee-way.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nSee social life and glee sit down,\r\nAll joyous and unthinking,\r\nTill, quite transmugrifyd, theyre grown\r\nDebauchery and drinking;\r\nO would they stay to calculate\r\nTh eternal consequences;\r\nOr your more dreaded hell to state,\r\nDmnation of expenses!\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nYe high, exalted, virtuous dames,\r\nTyd up in godly laces,\r\nBefore ye gie poor frailty names,\r\nSuppose a change o cases;\r\nA dear lovd lad, convenience snug,\r\nA treacherous inclination[111]\r\nBut, let me whisper, i your lug,\r\nYere aiblins nae temptation.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nThen gently scan your brother man,\r\nStill gentler sister woman;\r\nThough they may gang a kennin wrang,\r\nTo step aside is human:\r\nOne point must still be greatly dark,\r\nThe moving why they do it:\r\nAnd just as lamely can ye mark,\r\nHow far perhaps they rue it.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nWho made the heart, tis He alone\r\nDecidedly can try us,\r\nHe knows each chordits various tone,\r\nEach springits various bias:\r\nThen at the balance lets be mute,\r\nWe never can adjust it;\r\nWhats done we partly may compute,\r\nBut know not whats resisted.\r\n\r\nTO A MOUNTAIN DAISY,\r\nON TURNING ONE DOWN WITH THE PLOUGH IN APRIL, 1786\r\n\r\nThis was not the original title of this sweet poem: I \r\nhave a copy in the handwriting of Burns entitled The Gowan. This more natural \r\nname he changed as he did his own, without reasonable cause; and he changed it \r\nabout the same time, for he ceased to call himself Burness and his poem The \r\nGowan, in the first edition of his works. The field at Mossgiel where he \r\nturned down the Daisy is said to be the same field where some five months before \r\nhe turned up the Mouse; but this seems likely only to those who are little \r\nacquainted with tillagewho think that in time and place reside the chief charms \r\nof verse; and who feel not the beauty of The Daisy, till they seek and find \r\nthe spot on which it grew. Sublime morality and the deepest emotions of the soul \r\npass for little with those who remember only what the genius loves to forget.\r\n\r\nWee, modest, crimson-tipped flowr,\r\nThous met me in an evil hour;\r\nFor I maun crush amang the stoure\r\nThy slender stem:\r\nTo spare thee now is past my powr,\r\nThou bonnie gem.\r\n\r\nAlas! its no thy neebor sweet,\r\nThe bonnie lark, companion meet!\r\nBending thee mang the dewy weet,\r\nWi spreckld breast,\r\nWhen upward-springing, blythe, to greet\r\nThe purpling east.\r\n\r\nCauld blew the bitter-biting north\r\nUpon thy early, humble birth;\r\nYet cheerfully thou glinted forth\r\nAmid the storm,\r\nScarce reard above the parent earth\r\nThy tender form.\r\n\r\nThe flaunting flowers our gardens yield,\r\nHigh sheltring woods and was maun shield\r\nBut thou, beneath the random bield\r\nO clod or stane,\r\nAdorns the histie stibble-field,\r\nUnseen, alane.\r\n\r\nThere, in thy scanty mantle clad,\r\nThy snawie bosom sunward spread,\r\nThou lifts thy unassuming head\r\nIn humble guise;\r\nBut now the share uptears thy bed,\r\nAnd low thou lies!\r\n\r\nSuch is the fate of artless maid,\r\nSweet flowret of the rural shade!\r\nBy loves simplicity betrayd,\r\nAnd guileless trust,\r\nTill she, like thee, all soild, is laid\r\nLow i the dust.\r\n\r\nSuch is the fate of simple bard,\r\nOn lifes rough ocean luckless starrd!\r\nUnskilful he to note the card\r\nOf prudent lore,\r\nTill billows rage, and gales blow hard,\r\nAnd whelm him oer!\r\n\r\nSuch fate to suffering worth is givn,\r\nWho long with wants and woes has strivn,\r\nBy human pride or cunning drivn\r\nTo misrys brink,\r\nTill wrenched of every stay but Heavn,\r\nHe, ruind, sink!\r\n\r\nEvn thou who mournst the Daisys fate,\r\nThat fate is thineno distant date;\r\nStern Ruins ploughshare drives, elate,\r\nFull on thy bloom,\r\nTill crushd beneath the furrows weight,\r\nShall be thy doom!\r\n\r\nRelated pages: The Best Poems, Songs, \r\nQuotes and Epigrams of Robert Burns\r\n\r\nThe following are links to other translations by Michael R.
