We have also published \nHolocaust writings by Germans who opposed the Nazis, a Romani Gypsy, an Estonian \nrefugee, two Hiroshima survivors, and Pope John Paul II. You can find an \nextensive index of writings by victims and survivors of the Holocaust below, along with poems \nabout racism, intolerance, war, genocide \nand ethnic cleansing. Also included are essays by Nobel \nlaureates Albert Einstein and Elie Wiesel, both survivors of the Holocaust.Michael R.

To read the full poem, please click the picture above. In Mary Rae\'s painting, the Rose is thornless, \nrepresenting women and children who are defenseless unless we choose to protect them. As we read the Witnesses who follow, let\'s all \nsay Never again! and pledge to protect all women and all children from all such atrocities. \n\nAuschwitz was the largest of the Nazi concentration camps. In the poem above, the term surgeons appears in quotation marks \nfor purposes of irony because German doctors disobeyed their oaths to conduct experiments on \nprisoners, one of the \nghastlier aspects of the Holocaust. The most notorious Nazi surgeon was Josef Mengele, \nthe \nTodesengel (Death Angel). Mengele conducted macabre experiments on \nchildren and sent many completely innocent women and \nchildren to the gas chambers. Rudolf H\xf6ss testified at the Nuremberg \nTrials that up to three million people died at Auschwitz alone. \n\n\nSpeechless at Auschwitz\r\nby Ko Un\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nAt Auschwitz\r\npiles of glasses\r\nmountains of shoes\r\nreturning, we stared out different windows.\n\nKo Un speaks for all of us, by not knowing what to say about the evidence of the \nHolocaust, and man\'s inhumanity to man. \n\nFrail Envelope of Flesh\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers and children of the Holocaust and Nakba \n\nFrail envelope of flesh,\nlying cold on the surgeons table\nwith anguished eyes\nlike your mothers eyes\nand a heartbeat weak, unstable ...\n\nFrail crucible of dust,\nbrief flower come to this\nyour tiny hand\nin your mothers hand\nfor a last bewildered kiss ...\n\nBrief mayfly of a child,\nto live two artless years!\nNow your mothers lips\nseal up your lips\nfrom the Deluge of her tears ...\n\nWhen we consider man\'s inhumanity to man, few images are as stark as the one of \nNazi surgeons conducting horrific experiments on innocent children. \n\nSomething\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the children of the Holocaust and Nakba \n\nSomething inescapable is lost\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\nimmeasurable and void.\n\nSomething uncapturable is gone\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\nand remembrance.\n\nSomething unforgettable is past\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\n\nUnnecessary cruelty and brutality are horrible enough, but when \ninnocent children are the victims, words begin to fail us. The poem Something tries to capture something of the heartbreaking loss of young \nlives cut short, even as the poet admits his inability to do anything more than preserve a \nbrief flicker of remembrance, an increasingly ethereal memory. What happened to millions of children during \nthe Holocaust was a horror beyond imagining. Children who had been born wrong \naccording to the Naziswhether Jewish, Polish, Gypsy, Slavic, Russian or otherwise \ninferiorwere either killed outright or stripped of their human rights and \nconsigned to abysmal conditions in concentration camps and walled ghettoes. But \nas the poem below points out, even to this day completely innocent \nchildren continue to be stripped of their human rights and consigned to \nabysmal, terrifying conditions in refugee camps \nand walled ghettoes, while the world watches and does little or nothing \nto help them.\n\nEpitaph for a Child of the Nakba\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nThe Hebrew word for the Holocaust is Shoah; it means Catastrophe. The Arabic \nword Nakba also means Catastrophe. Today millions of completely innocent \nPalestinian children and their mothers and grandparents languish within the walled ghetto of Gaza, the walled \nbantustans of Occupied Palestine (the West Bank) and refugee camps across the \nMiddle East. Why are people who are obviously not terrorists being \ncollectively punished for the crime of having been born wrong, just as Jews were once collectively punished by the Nazis? If it concerns you that such things continue to happen today, \nand in this case are being funded and supported by the government of the United \nStates, please visit our \nNakba Index and read what great humanitarians and Nobel Peace Prize winners \nlike Albert Einstein, Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Jimmy \nCarter have said on the subject. The most \nadmired Jewish intellectual of all time, the man most responsible for the advent \nof modern nonviolent resistance, the two men best known for ending South African \napartheid, and the president who helped negotiate peace between Israel and \nPalestinians have all spoken firmly and eloquently against the racism and \ninjustices that resulted in this new catastrophe, \nthe Nakba. \nIf you are a Christian, or have an interest in such things, you may want to read\nDid a \nMisinterpretation of the Bible lead to the Trail of Tears, American Slavery and \nthe Holocaust? \n\nCleansings\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWalk here among the walking specters. Learn\r\ninhuman patience. Flesh can only cleave\r\nto bone this tightly if their hearts believe\r\nthat God is good, and never mind the Urn.\r\n\r\nA lentil and a bean might plump their skin\r\nwith mothers bounteous, soft-dimpled fat\r\n(and call it health), might quickly build again\r\nthe muscles of dead menfolk. Dream, like that,\r\n\r\nand call it courage. Cry, and be deceived,\r\nand so endure. Or burn, made wholly pure.\r\nOnes prayer is answered,\r\n god thus unbelieved.\r\n\r\nNo holy pyre thisdeaths hissing chamber.\r\nTwo thousand years agoa starlit manger,\r\nweird Herods cries for vengeance on the meek,\r\nthe children slaughtered. Fear, when angels speak,\r\n\r\nthe prophesies of man.\r\n  Do what you "can,"\r\nnot what you must, or should.\r\n  They call you good,\r\n\r\ndead eyes devoid of tears; how shall they speak\r\nexcept in blankness? Fear, then, how they weep.\r\nEscape the gentle clutching stickfolk. Creep\r\naway in shame to retch and flush away\r\n\r\nyour vomit from their ashes. Learn to pray.\r\n\nHolocaust Poetry, Testimonies and Essays by Holocaust Victims and Survivors, and Great Humanitarians \n\nMikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti (translations of a Hungarian Jewish poet; perhaps the greatest of the Holocaust poets)\nLouis Emanuel Fynaut (a Flemish resistance fighter with a keen eye and a keener pen)\nTerez\xedn Children\'s Holocaust Poems (poems by child poets of a Nazi concentration camp)\nMartin Niem\xf6ller (he wrote the most famous of all Holocaust poems: First they came for the Jews ...)\nEinstein on Palestine (Albert Einstein was both a victim and survivor of the Holocaust)\nMahmoud Darwish (the preeminent Palestinian Holocaust poet of his day)\nErich Fried(one of the better forthright, blunt-spoken Holocaust poets)\nMary Elizabeth Frye \n(she penned one of the best-loved poems of the English language, under \nmysterious circumstances)\nKarol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) (poetry by Pope John Paul II, a Holocaust victim and survivor)\nPaul Celan (translations of a German Jewish poet, including his famous poem Todesfuge or Death Fugue)\nThe Ghetto Poets (translations of Polish Jewish ghetto poets by Yala Korwin)Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (revisit the ringing words of the man whose impossible dream of equality became a reality)\nMohandas Gandhi (please read and consider what the great advocate of non-violent resistance had to say about the Nakba)\n Nayef Hashlamoun (a prize-winning Reuters journalist shares pictures of Hebron)\n\nAs you explore these pages, please keep in mind that if Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, \nhomosexuals and other people deemed inferior by the Nazis had not been denied \naccess to fair laws and courts, the Holocaust could never have happened. The Holocaust was, essentially, a \nfailure of justice that led to the disintegration of the moral foundations of \nsociety. In order to prevent other Holocausts, we must ensure that every \nchild is protected by fair laws and courts. There can be no \nexceptions, because every exception begins life as a \ndefenseless \nbaby. And so please pay particular attention to our\nNakba pages, because \nwhile the Nazi Holocaust has thankfully ended, multitudes of innocent \nchildren are now suffering and dying in this new Holocaust. \nNow is the time to ensure that all  \nchildren are protected by equal rights, fair laws and fair courts. Then we can \nwrite celebratory poetry, rather than mournful laments and dirges.\n\n\nReuven Moskovitz (a Jewish Holocaust survivor who received the Mount Zion \nAward and the Aachen Peace Prize)\nBertolt Brecht \n(a German poet who opposed the Nazis)\n\nChaim Nachman Bialik (considered by many to be Israel\'s national poet)\nAvraham Burg: the \nProphet-Poet of Judaism (Holocaust writings by a Jewish politician and peace \nactivist)\n\nDahlia Ravikovitch (Holocaust poetry by one of Israel\'s foremost poets)\n\nWhat I learned from Elie Wiesel and other Jewish Holocaust Survivors (an essay by Michael R.
