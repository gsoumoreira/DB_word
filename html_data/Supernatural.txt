Eerie poems about the supernatural abound in English literature; indeed, some of \r\nthe oldest extant Anglo Saxon and Celtic poems have supernatural \r\nthemes and/or elements. Early ballads, the precursors of popular music,  \r\noften had supernatural themes as well: for instance, The Unquiet Grave and The Wife \r\nof Usher\'s Well. Common themes include ghosts, witches, hauntings, vampires, ghouls, \r\ncorpses that return to life, zombies, mysterious strangers, the underworld, the \r\nmacabre, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI chose the first two poems \r\non this page to complement the ghoulish Halloween picture above. (In fact, I wrote the first poem \r\nspecifically to go with the picture.) The poems that follow include some \r\nof the best dark, haunting poems in the English language, by \r\nmasters of the supernatural like Conrad Aiken, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Walter \r\nDe La Mare, Ernest Dowson, John \r\nKeats, Alfred Noyes, Edgar Allan Poe, Edward Arlington Robinson, William \r\nShakespeare, William Butler Yeats ... and, of course, the greatest of all \r\nsupernaturalists, Anonymous!\r\n\r\nRelated pages: The Best Vampire Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThin Kin\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nVampires are such fragile creatures;\r\nwe dread the dark, but the light destroys them ...\r\nsunlight, or a stake, or a crosssuch common things.\r\nStill, late at night, when the bat-like vampire sings,\r\nwe shrink from his voice.\r\nCenturies have taught us:\r\nin shadows danger lurks for those who stray,\r\nand there the vampire bares his yellow fangs\r\nand feels the ancient soul-tormenting pangs.\r\nHe has no choice.\r\nWe are his prey, plump and fragrant,\r\nand if we pray to avoid him, the more he prays to find us ...\r\nprays to some despotic hooded God\r\nwhose benediction is the humid blood\r\nhe lusts to taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSea Fevers\r\nby Agnes Wathall\r\n\r\n\r\nNo ancient mariner I,\r\nHawker of public crosses,\r\nSnaring the passersby\r\nWith my necklace of albatrosses.\r\n\r\nI blink no glittering eye\r\nBetween tufts of gray sea mosses\r\nNor in the high road ply\r\nMy trade of guilts and glosses.\r\n\r\nBut a dark and inward sky\r\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\r\nNo more becalmed to lie,\r\nThe skeleton ship tosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlalume [an excerpt]\r\nby Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\nThe skies they were ashen and sober;\r\nThe leaves they were crisped and sere\r\nThe leaves they were withering and sere;\r\nIt was night in the lonesome October\r\nOf my most immemorial year:\r\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\nIn the misty mid region of Weir\r\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\nIn the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite in the shadows\r\nI see your face,\r\nunbidden. Go, tell\r\n\r\nLove it is commonplace;\r\ntell Regret it is not so rare.\r\nOur love is not here\r\nthough you smile,\r\nfull of sedulous grace.\r\nLost in darkness, I fear\r\nthe past is our resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristabel [an excerpt]\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nBeneath the lamp the lady bowed,\r\nAnd slowly rolled her eyes around;\r\nThen drawing in her breath aloud,\r\nLike one that shuddered, she unbound\r\nThe cincture from beneath her breast:\r\nHer silken robe, and inner vest,\r\nDropt to her feet, and full in view,\r\nBehold! her bosom, and half her side\r\nA sight to dream of, not to tell!\r\nO shield her! shield sweet Christabel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Hallows Eve\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the mysterious Tuatha De Danann, to the Ban Shee (from which \r\nwe get the term banshee) and, eventually, to the Druids? One might assume that \r\nwith the passing of Merlyn, Morgan le Fay and their ilk, the time of myths and magic \r\nended. This poem is an epitaph of sorts.\r\n\r\nIn the ruins\r\nof the dreams\r\nand the schemes\r\nof men;\r\nwhen the moon\r\nbegets the tide\r\nand the wide\r\nsea sighs;\r\nwhen a star\r\nappears in heaven\r\nand the raven\r\ncries;\r\nwe will dance\r\nand we will revel\r\nin the devils\r\nfen ...\r\nif nevermore again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPale Though Her Eyes\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nPale though her eyes,\r\nher lips are scarlet\r\nfrom drinking of blood,\r\nthis child, this harlot\r\nborn of the night\r\nand her heart, of darkness,\r\nevil incarnate\r\nto dance so reckless,\r\ndreaming of blood,\r\nher fangswhitebaring,\r\nrevealing her lust,\r\nand her eyes, pale, staring ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lovemaker\r\n\r\nby Robert Mezey\r\n\r\nI see you in her bed,\r\nDark, rootless epicene,\r\nWhere a lone ghost is laid\r\nAnd other ghosts convene;\r\n\r\nAnd hear you moan at last\r\nYour pleasure in the deep\r\nHaven of her who kissed\r\nYour blind mouth into sleep.\r\n\r\nBut body, once enthralled,\r\nWakes in the chains it wore,\r\nDishevelled, stupid, cold,\r\nAnd famished as before,\r\n\r\nAnd hears its paragon\r\nBreathe in the ghostly air,\r\nAnonymous carrion\r\nRavished by despair.\r\n\r\nLovemaker, I have felt\r\nDesire take my part,\r\nBut lacked your constant fault\r\nAnd something of your art,\r\n\r\nAnd would not bend my knees\r\nTo the unmantled pride\r\nThat left you in that place,\r\nForever unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n"I am not as I was under the reign of the good Cynara"Horace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Angels, Winged\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nIt was early in the morning, in the forming of my soul,\r\nin the dawning of desire, with passion at first bloom,\r\nwith lightning splitting heaven to thunder\'s blasting roll\r\nand a sense of welling fire and, perhaps, impending doom\r\nthat I cried out through the tumult of the raging storm on high\r\nfor shelter from the chaos of the restless, driving rain ...\r\nand the voice I heard replying from a rift of bleeding sky\r\nwas mine, I\'m sure, and, furthermore, was certainly insane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song\r\nAnonymous ballad, circa 1620\r\n\r\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\r\nThat into rags would rend ye,\r\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\r\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\r\nThat of your five sound senses\r\nYou never be forsaken,\r\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\r\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nOf thirty bare years have I\r\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\r\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\r\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\r\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\r\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\r\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\r\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\r\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\r\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\r\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\r\nI befell into this dotage.\r\nI slept not since the Conquest,\r\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\r\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\r\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\r\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\r\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\r\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\r\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\r\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\r\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\r\nMe music to my sorrow.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\r\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\r\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\r\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\r\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\r\nI sup, and when benighted,\r\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\r\nYet never am affrighted.\r\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nI know more than Apollo,\r\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\r\nI see the stars at mortal wars\r\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\r\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\r\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\r\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\r\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\r\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\r\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\r\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\r\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\r\nMe handle not nor spare not;\r\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\r\nDo what the panther dare not.\r\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith an host of furious fancies,\r\nWhereof I am commander,\r\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\r\nTo the wilderness I wander.\r\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\r\nI summoned am to tourney\r\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\r\nMethinks it is no journey.\r\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolicitation\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nHe comes to me out of the shadows, acknowledging\r\nmy presence with a tip of his hat, always the gentleman,\r\nand his eyes are on my eyes like a snakes on a birds\r\nquizzical, mesmerizing.\r\nHe cocks his head as though something he heard intrigues him\r\n(though I hear nothing) and he smiles, amusing himself at my expense;\r\nhis words are full of desire and loathing, and though I hear,\r\nhe says nothing that I understand.\r\nThe moon shinesmaniacal, queeras he takes my hand and whispers\r\nOur time has come ... and so we stroll together along the docks\r\nwhere the sea sends things that wriggle and crawl\r\nscurrying under rocks and boards.\r\nMoonlight in great floods washes his pale face as he stares unseeing\r\ninto my eyes. He sighs, and the sound crawls slithering down my spine,\r\nand my blood seems to pause at his touch as he caresses my face.\r\nHe unfastens my dress till the white lace shows, and my neck is bared.\r\nHis teeth are long, yellow and hard. His face is bearded and haggard.\r\nA wolf howls in the distance. There are no wolves in New York. I gasp.\r\nMy blood is a trickle his wet tongue embraces. My heart races madly.\r\nHe likes it like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nLenore\r\nby Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nAh broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\r\nLet the bell toll!a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;\r\nAnd, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear?weep now or never more!\r\nSee! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\r\nCome! let the burial rite be readthe funeral song be sung!\r\nAn anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young\r\nA dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.\r\n\r\nWretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,\r\nAnd when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed herthat she died!\r\nHow shall the ritual, then, be read?the requiem how be sung\r\nBy youby yours, the evil eye,by yours, the slanderous tongue\r\nThat did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?\r\n\r\nPeccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\r\nGo up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!\r\nThe sweet Lenore hath gone before, with Hope, that flew beside\r\nLeaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride\r\nFor her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,\r\nThe life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes\r\nThe life still there, upon her hairthe death upon her eyes.\r\n\r\nAvaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,\r\nBut waft the angel on her flight with a P\xe6an of old days!\r\nLet no bell toll!lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,\r\nShould catch the note, as it doth float up from the damn\xe9d Earth.\r\nTo friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven\r\nFrom Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven\r\nFrom grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nKindred\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nRise, pale disastrous moon!\r\nWhat is love, but a heightened effect\r\nof time, light and distance?\r\nDid you burn once,\r\nbefore you became\r\nso remote, so detached,\r\nso coldly, inhumanly lustrous,\r\nbefore you were able to assume\r\nthe very pallor of love itself?\r\nWhat is the dawn now, to you or to me?\r\nWe are as one,\r\nout of favor with the sun.\r\nWe would exhume\r\nthe white corpse of love\r\nfor a last dance,\r\nand yet we will not.\r\nWe will let her be,\r\nlet her abide,\r\nfor she is nothing now,\r\nto you\r\nor to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vampire\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nShe rose among us where we lay.\r\nShe wept, we put our work away.\r\nShe chilled our laughter, stilled our play;\r\nAnd spread a silence there.\r\nAnd darkness shot across the sky,\r\nAnd once, and twice, we heard her cry;\r\nAnd saw her lift white hands on high\r\nAnd toss her troubled hair.\r\n\r\nWhat shape was this who came to us,\r\nWith basilisk eyes so ominous,\r\nWith mouth so sweet, so poisonous,\r\nAnd tortured hands so pale?\r\nWe saw her wavering to and fro,\r\nThrough dark and wind we saw her go;\r\nYet what her name was did not know;\r\nAnd felt our spirits fail.\r\n\r\nWe tried to turn away; but still\r\nAbove we heard her sorrow thrill;\r\nAnd those that slept, they dreamed of ill\r\nAnd dreadful things:\r\nOf skies grown red with rending flames\r\nAnd shuddering hills that cracked their frames;\r\nOf twilights foul with wings;\r\n\r\nAnd skeletons dancing to a tune;\r\nAnd cries of children stifled soon;\r\nAnd over all a blood-red moon\r\nA dull and nightmare size.\r\nThey woke, and sought to go their ways,\r\nYet everywhere they met her gaze,\r\nHer fixed and burning eyes.\r\n\r\nWho are you now, we cried to her\r\nSpirit so strange, so sinister?\r\nWe felt dead winds above us stir;\r\nAnd in the darkness heard\r\nA voice fall, singing, cloying sweet,\r\nHeavily dropping, though that heat,\r\nHeavy as honeyed pulses beat,\r\nSlow word by anguished word.\r\n\r\nAnd through the night strange music went\r\nWith voice and cry so darkly blent\r\nWe could not fathom what they meant;\r\nSave only that they seemed\r\nTo thin the blood along our veins,\r\nForetelling vile, delirious pains,\r\nAnd clouds divulging blood-red rains\r\nUpon a hill undreamed.\r\n\r\nAnd this we heard: Who dies for me,\r\nHe shall possess me secretly,\r\nMy terrible beauty he shall see,\r\nAnd slake my body\'s flame.\r\nBut who denies me cursed shall be,\r\nAnd slain, and buried loathsomely,\r\nAnd slimed upon with shame.\r\n\r\nAnd darkness fell. And like a sea\r\nOf stumbling deaths we followed, we\r\nWho dared not stay behind.\r\nThere all night long beneath a cloud\r\nWe rose and fell, we struck and bowed,\r\nWe were the ploughman and the ploughed,\r\nOur eyes were red and blind.\r\n\r\nAnd some, they said, had touched her side,\r\nBefore she fled us there;\r\nAnd some had taken her to bride;\r\nAnd some lain down for her and died;\r\nWho had not touched her hair,\r\nRan to and fro and cursed and cried\r\nAnd sought her everywhere.\r\n\r\nHer eyes have feasted on the dead,\r\nAnd small and shapely is her head,\r\nAnd dark and small her mouth, they said,\r\nAnd beautiful to kiss;\r\nHer mouth is sinister and red\r\nAs blood in moonlight is.\r\n\r\nThen poets forgot their jeweled words\r\nAnd cut the sky with glittering swords;\r\nAnd innocent souls turned carrion birds\r\nTo perch upon the dead.\r\nSweet daisy fields were drenched with death,\r\nThe air became a charnel breath,\r\nPale stones were splashed with red.\r\n\r\nGreen leaves were dappled bright with blood\r\nAnd fruit trees murdered in the bud;\r\nAnd when at length the dawn\r\nCame green as twilight from the east,\r\nAnd all that heaving horror ceased,\r\nSilent was every bird and beast,\r\nAnd that dark voice was gone.\r\n\r\nNo word was there, no song, no bell,\r\nNo furious tongue that dream to tell;\r\nOnly the dead, who rose and fell\r\nAbove the wounded men;\r\nAnd whisperings and wails of pain\r\nBlown slowly from the wounded grain,\r\nBlown slowly from the smoking plain;\r\nAnd silence fallen again.\r\n\r\nUntil at dusk, from God knows where,\r\nBeneath dark birds that filled the air,\r\nLike one who did not hear or care,\r\nUnder a blood-red cloud,\r\nAn aged ploughman came alone\r\nAnd drove his share through flesh and bone,\r\nAnd turned them under to mould and stone;\r\nAll night long he ploughed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevermore!\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nNevermore! O, nevermore!\r\nshall the haunts of the sea\r\nthe swollen tide pools\r\nand the dark, deserted shore\r\nmark her passing again.\r\nAnd the salivating sea\r\nshall never kiss her lips\r\nnor caress her breasts and hips\r\nas she dreamt it did before,\r\nonce, lost within the uproar.\r\nThe waves will never rape her,\r\nnor take her at their leisure;\r\nthe sea gulls shall not have her,\r\nnor could she give them pleasure ...\r\nShe sleeps, forevermore!\r\nShe sleeps forevermore,\r\na virgin save to me\r\nand her other lover,\r\nwho lurks now, safely smothered\r\nby the restless, surging sea.\r\nAnd, yes, they sleep together,\r\nbut never in that way ...\r\nFor the sea has stripped and shorn\r\nthe one I once adored,\r\nand washed her flesh away.\r\nHe does not stroke her honey hair,\r\nfor she is bald, bald to the bone!\r\nAnd how it fills my heart with glee\r\nto hear them sometimes cursing me\r\nout of the depths of the demon sea ...\r\ntheir skeletal loveimpossibility!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highwayman\r\n\r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,\r\nThe moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,\r\nThe road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,\r\nAnd the highwayman came riding\r\n           Ridingriding\r\nThe highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nII\r\nHe\'d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,\r\nA coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;\r\nThey fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!\r\nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle,\r\n           His pistol butts a-twinkle,\r\nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.\r\n\r\nIII\r\nOver the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,\r\nAnd he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;\r\nHe whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there\r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\r\nIV\r\nAnd dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked\r\nWhere Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;\r\nHis eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,\r\nBut he loved the landlord\'s daughter,\r\n           The landlord\'s red-lipped daughter,\r\nDumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say\r\n\r\nV\r\n"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I\'m after a prize to-night,\r\nBut I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;\r\nYet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,\r\nThen look for me by moonlight,\r\n           Watch for me by moonlight,\r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way."\r\n\r\nVI\r\nHe rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,\r\nBut she loosened her hair i\' the casement! His face burnt like a brand\r\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;\r\nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight,\r\n           (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)\r\nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nI\r\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;\r\nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon,\r\nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor,\r\nA red-coat troop came marching\r\n           Marchingmarching\r\nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nII\r\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,\r\nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;\r\nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!\r\nThere was death at every window;\r\n           And hell at one dark window;\r\nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.\r\n\r\nIII\r\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;\r\nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\r\n"Now, keep good watch!" and they kissed her.\r\n           She heard the dead man say\r\nLook for me by moonlight;\r\n           Watch for me by moonlight;\r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!\r\nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!\r\nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,\r\nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight,\r\n           Cold, on the stroke of midnight,\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!\r\n\r\nV\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\r\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,\r\nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;\r\nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight;\r\n           Blank and bare in the moonlight;\r\nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s refrain.\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;\r\nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?\r\nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,\r\nThe highwayman came riding,\r\n           Riding, riding!\r\nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!\r\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\r\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,\r\nThen her finger moved in the moonlight,\r\n           Her musket shattered the moonlight,\r\nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood\r\nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\r\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear\r\nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\n           The landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.\r\n\r\nIX\r\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,\r\nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\r\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,\r\nWhen they shot him down on the highway,\r\n           Down like a dog on the highway,\r\nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.\r\n\r\nX\r\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,\r\nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,\r\nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,\r\nA highwayman comes riding\r\n           Ridingriding\r\nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;\r\nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;\r\nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there\r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Hunt\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOur Halloween is an inheritance from the ancient Celts. The Celts believed \r\nthat the otherworld can sometimes merge with the real world, so that elves, \r\nfairies, witches, warlocks and other fantastical entities are able to either \r\nhelp or harm human beings.\r\n\r\nNear Devon, the hunters appear in the sky\r\nwith Artur and Bedwyr sounding the call;\r\nand the others, laughing, go dashing by.\r\nThey only appear when the moon is full:\r\n\r\nValerin, the King of the Tangled Wood,\r\nand Valynt, the goodly King of Wales,\r\nGawain and Owain and the hearty men\r\nwho live on in many minstrels tales.\r\n\r\nThey seek the white stag on a moonlit moor,\r\nor Torc Triath, the fabled boar,\r\nor Ysgithyrwyn, or Twrch Trwyth,\r\nthe other mighty boars of myth.\r\n\r\nThey appear, sometimes, on Halloween\r\nto chase the moon across the green,\r\nthen fade into the shadowed hills\r\nwhere memory alone prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6 from The Dark Side of the Deity: Interlude\r\nby\r\n\r\nJoe M. Ruggier\r\n\r\nWhen Satan hurled, before the Dawn,\r\ndefiance at the Lord of History;\r\nand Michael stood, and Glory shone,\r\nWhose hand controlled the timeless Mystery?\r\nWho but the Insult was the leveler;\r\nDeliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen Athens, sung in verse and prose,\r\ncaught all the World\'s imagination;\r\nwhen Ilion fell, and Rome arose,\r\nand Time went on like pagination:\r\n Who but the Insult was the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen books, in numberless infinities,\r\ncross-fertilize the teeming brain,\r\nand warring, vex the Soul with Vanities,\r\n and Insults hurtle, Insults rain:\r\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nAnd when we too shall cease to be,\r\n like all the Kingdoms of the Past,\r\nand groaning, gasping, wrenching free,\r\n we bite, at last, alone, the dust:\r\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen churchbells fill the wandering fields\r\n  with Love and Fear,\r\nthe Flesh and Blood of Jesus yields\r\n  deliverance dear,\r\nto them who believe in the Compliment Sinsear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides ... High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiem\r\nby Robert L. Stevenson\r\n\r\nUnder the wide and starry sky\r\nDig the grave and let me lie.\r\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\r\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\r\n\r\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\r\n"Here he lies where he longed to be,\r\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\r\nAnd the hunter home from the hill."\r\n\r\n\r\nHaunted Houses\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nAll houses wherein men have lived and died\r\nAre haunted houses. Through the open doors\r\nThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,\r\nWith feet that make no sound upon the floors.\r\n\r\nWe meet them at the door-way, on the stair,\r\nAlong the passages they come and go,\r\nImpalpable impressions on the air,\r\nA sense of something moving to and fro.\r\n\r\nThere are more guests at table than the hosts\r\nInvited; the illuminated hall\r\nIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\r\nAs silent as the pictures on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe stranger at my fireside cannot see\r\nThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;\r\nHe but perceives what is; while unto me\r\nAll that has been is visible and clear.\r\n\r\nWe have no title-deeds to house or lands;\r\nOwners and occupants of earlier dates\r\nFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,\r\nAnd hold in mortmain still their old estates.\r\n\r\nThe spirit-world around this world of sense\r\nFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhere\r\nWafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense\r\nA vital breath of more ethereal air.\r\n\r\nOur little lives are kept in equipoise\r\nBy opposite attractions and desires;\r\nThe struggle of the instinct that enjoys,\r\nAnd the more noble instinct that aspires.\r\n\r\nThese perturbations, this perpetual jar\r\nOf earthly wants and aspirations high,\r\nCome from the influence of an unseen star\r\nAn undiscovered planet in our sky.\r\n\r\nAnd as the moon from some dark gate of cloud\r\nThrows o\'er the sea a floating bridge of light,\r\nAcross whose trembling planks our fancies crowd\r\nInto the realm of mystery and night,\r\n\r\nSo from the world of spirits there descends\r\nA bridge of light, connecting it with this,\r\nO\'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,\r\nWander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore great ghost stories and other eerie, haunting Halloween poems:\r\n\r\nLa Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats\r\nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nMariana  by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\nThe Apparition by John Donne\r\nGoblin Market by Christina Rossetti\r\nThe Blessed Damozel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nSudden Light by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nAllayne by Kevin N.
