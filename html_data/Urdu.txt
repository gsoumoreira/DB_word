These are my modern English translations of their poems, just in time for Valentine\'s Day, \r\nproving that love truly is a universal language! Urdu poetry is notable for its highly romantic images, evocative metaphors, emotional content, depth of feeling, \r\ntranscendence, and sheer passion!\r\n\r\nmodern English translations by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIf you like my translations you are welcome to share \r\nthem for noncommercial purposes, but please be sure to credit the original poet \r\nand the translator. \r\n\r\nPlease note that I call my translations loose translations and \r\ninterpretations because they are not literal word-for-word \r\ntranslations. I begin with my \r\npersonal interpretation of a poem and translate accordingly. To critics who \r\nobject to variations from the original texts, my response is that there are \r\noften substantial disagreements among even the most accomplished translators. \r\nVariations begin with the readings because different \r\npeople get different things from different poems. And a strict word-for-word \r\ntranslation will seldom, if ever, result in poetry. In my opinion translation is \r\nmuch closer to an art than a perfect science and I side with Rabindranath \r\nTagore, who said he needed some leeway in order to produce poetry in another \r\nlanguage when he translated his own poems into English.MRB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will never comprehend me:\r\nI pour out my feelings; you only read the words!\r\noriginal poet unknown, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nOn the subject of mystic philosophy, Ghalib, \r\nyour words might have struck us as deeply profound ...\r\nHell, we might have pronounced you a saint,\r\nif only we hadn\'t found\r\nyou drunk\r\nas a skunk!\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by  \r\nMirza Ghalib later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithered Roses\r\nby Allama Iqbal\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat words of mine can describe you,\r\ndesire of the nightingale\'s heart?\r\nThe morning breeze was your nativity,\r\nthe afternoon garden, a tray of perfumes.\r\n\r\nMy tears welled up like dew,\r\ntill in my abandoned heart your rune grew,\r\nthis dream-emblem of love:\r\nthis spray of withered roses.\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by \r\nAllama Iqbal later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Night \r\nby \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nEven in the torture chamber, I was the lucky one;\r\nwhen each lottery was over, unaccountably I had won.\r\n\r\nAnd even the mightiest rivers found accessible refuge in me;\r\nthough I was called an arid desert, I turned out to be the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd how sweetly I remember youoh, my wild, delectable love! \r\nas the purest white blossoms bloom, on talented branches above. \r\n\r\nAnd while Im half-convinced that folks adore me in this town,\r\nstill, all the hands I kissed held knives and tried to shake me down. \r\n\r\nYou lost the battle, my coward friend, my craven enemy,\r\nwhen, to victimize my lonely soul, you sent a despoiling army.\r\n\r\nLost in the wastelands of vast love, I was an eager traveler,\r\nlike a breeze in search of your fragrance, a vagabond explorer.\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by \r\nAhmad Faraz later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Condition of My Heart\r\nby Munir Niazi\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for anyone else to get excited:\r\nThe condition of my heart is not the condition of hers.\r\nBut were we to receive any sort of good news, Munir, \r\nHow spectacular compared to earth\'s mundane sunsets!\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by Munir Niazi later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFailures\r\nby Nida Fazli \r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nMy apologies, Sona,\r\nif traversing my verse\'s terrain\r\nin these torrential rains\r\ninconvenienced you.\r\n\r\nThe monsoons are unseasonal here.\r\n\r\nMy poems\' pitfalls are sometimes sodden.\r\nWater often overflows these ditches.\r\nIf you stumble and fall here, you run the risk\r\nof spraining an ankle.\r\n\r\nMy apologies, however,\r\nif you were inconvenienced\r\nbecause my dismal verse lacks light,\r\nor because my threshold\'s stones\r\ninterfered as you passed.\r\n\r\nI have often cracked toenails against them!\r\n\r\nAs for the streetlamp at the intersection,\r\nit remains unlit ... endlessly indecisive. \r\n\r\nIf you were inconvenienced,\r\nyou have my heartfelt apologies!\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by \r\nGulzar later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\nCome As You Are\r\nby \r\nRabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nIs your hair untamable, your part uneven, your bodice unfastened? Never mind.\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances! \r\nSkip with quicksilver steps across the grass.\r\nIf your feet glisten with dew, if your anklets slip, if your beaded necklace \r\nslides off? Never mind.\r\nSkip with quicksilver steps across the grass. \r\nDo you see the clouds enveloping the sky?\r\nFlocks of cranes erupt from the riverbank, fitful gusts ruffle the fields, \r\nanxious cattle tremble in their stalls.\r\nDo you see the clouds enveloping the sky? \r\nYou loiter in vain over your toilet lamp; it flickers and dies in the wind.\r\nWho will care that your eyelids have not been painted with lamp-black, when your \r\npupils are darker than thunderstorms?\r\nYou loiter in vain over your toilet lamp; it flickers and dies in the wind. \r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nIf the wreath lies unwoven, who cares? If the bracelet is unfastened, let it \r\nfall. The sky grows dark; it is late.\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nUnfit Gifts\r\nby \r\nRabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nAt sunrise, I cast my nets into the sea,\r\ndredging up the strangest and most beautiful objects from the depths ...\r\nsome radiant like smiles, some glittering like tears, others flushed like \r\nbrides cheeks.\r\nWhen I returned, staggering under their weight, my love was relaxing in her \r\ngarden, idly tearing leaves from flowers.\r\nHesitant, I placed all I had produced at her feet, silently awaiting her \r\nverdict.\r\nShe glanced down disdainfully, then pouted: What are these bizarre things? I \r\nhave no use for them!\r\nI bowed my head, humiliated, and thought:\r\nTruly, I did not contend for them; I did not purchase them in the marketplace; \r\nthey are unfit gifts for her!\r\nThat night I flung them, one by one, into the street, like refuse.\r\nThe next morning travelers came, picked them up and carted them off to exotic \r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Seashore Gathering\r\nby \r\nRabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds, earth\'s children converge.\r\nThe infinite sky is motionless, the restless waters boisterous.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds earth\'s children gather to dance with joyous \r\ncries and pirouettes.\r\nThey build sand castles and play with hollow shells.\r\nThey weave boats out of withered leaves and laughingly float them out over the \r\nvast deep.\r\nEarth\'s children play gaily on the seashores of endless worlds.\r\nThey do not know, yet, how to cast nets or swim.\r\nDivers fish for pearls and merchants sail their ships, while earth\'s children \r\nskip, gather pebbles and scatter them again.\r\nThey are unaware of hidden treasures, nor do they know how to cast nets, yet.\r\nThe sea surges with laughter, smiling palely on the seashore.\r\nDeath-dealing waves sing the children meaningless songs, like a mother \r\nlullabying her baby\'s cradle.\r\nThe sea plays with the children, smiling palely on the seashore.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds earth\'s children meet.\r\nTempests roam pathless skies, ships lie wrecked in uncharted waters, death \r\nwanders abroad, and still the children play.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds there is a great gathering of earth\'s \r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThis Dog\r\nby \r\nRabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEach morning this dog,\r\nwho has become quite attached to me,\r\nsits silently at my feet\r\nuntil, gently caressing his head,\r\nI acknowledge his company.\r\n\r\nThis simple recognition gives my companion such joy\r\nhe shudders with sheer delight.\r\n\r\nAmong all languageless creatures\r\nhe alone has seen through man entire\r\nhas seen beyond what is good or bad in him\r\nto such a depth he can lay down his life\r\nfor the sake of love alone.\r\n\r\nNow it is he who shows me the way\r\nthrough this unfathomable world throbbing with life.\r\n\r\nWhen I see his deep devotion,\r\nhis offer of his whole being,\r\nI fail to comprehend ...\r\n\r\nHow, through sheer instinct,\r\nhas he discovered whatever it is that he knows?\r\n\r\nWith his anxious piteous looks\r\nhe cannot communicate his understanding\r\nand yet somehow has succeeded in conveying to me\r\nout of the entire creation\r\nthe true loveworthiness of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing\r\nby Momin Khan Momin\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou are so close to me\r\nthat no one else ever can be.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is a legend that the great Urdu poet  \r\nMirza Ghalib offered all his\r\ndiwan (poetry collections) in exchange for this one sher \r\n(couplet) by Momin Khan Momin. Does the couplet mean be as close or be, at \r\nall? Does it mean You are with me in a way that no one else can ever be? Or \r\ndoes it mean that no one else can ever exist as truly as one\'s true love? Or \r\ndoes this sher contain an infinite number of elusive meanings, like love itself?\r\n\r\nBeing (II)\r\nby Momin Khan Momin\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou alone are with me when I am alone.\r\nYou are beside me when I am beside myself.\r\nYou are as close to me as everyone else is afar.\r\nYou are so close to me\r\nthat no one else ever can be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps\r\nby Momin Khan Momin\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe cohesiveness between us, you may remember or perhaps not. \r\nOur solemn oaths of faithfulness, you may remember, or perhaps forgot.\r\nIf something happened that was not to your liking,\r\nthe shrinking away that produces silence, you may remember, or perhaps not. \r\nListen, the sagas of so many years, the promises you made amid time\'s onslaught,\r\nwhich you now fail to mention, you may remember or perhaps not. \r\nThese new resentments, those often rehashed complaints, \r\nthese lighthearted and displeasing stories, you may remember, or perhaps forgot.\r\nSome seasons ago we shared love and desire, we shared joy ...\r\nThat we once were dear friends, you may have perhaps forgot.\r\nNow if we come together, by fate or by chance, to express old loyalties ...\r\nOur every shared breath, all our sighs and regrets, you may remember, or perhaps \r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happened to Them?\r\nby Nasir Kazmi\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThose who came ashore, what happened to them?\r\nThose who sailed away, what happened to them?\r\n\r\nThose who were coming at dawn, when dawn never \r\narrived ...\r\nThose caravans en route, what happened to them?\r\n\r\nThose I awaited each night on moonless paths,\r\nWho were meant to light beacons, what happened \r\nto them?\r\n\r\nWho are these strangers surrounding me now?\r\nAll my lost friends and allies, what happened to them?\r\n\r\nThose who built these blazing buildings, what happened to them?\r\nThose who were meant to uplift us, what happened to them?\r\n\r\nNOTE: This poignant poem was written about the 1947 partition of \r\nIndia into two nations: India and Pakistan. I take the following poem to be \r\nabout the aftermath of the division.\r\n\r\nClimate Change\r\nby Nasir Kazmi\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe songs of our silenced lips are different. \r\nThe expressions of our regretful hearts are different. \r\n\r\nIn milder climes our grief was more tolerable, \r\nBut the burdens we bear now are different. \r\n\r\nO, walkers of awareness\'s road, keep your watch!\r\nThe obstacles strewn on this stony path are different. \r\n\r\nWe neither fear separation, nor desire union;\r\nThe anxieties of my rebellious heart are different. \r\n\r\nIn the first leaf-fall only flowers fluttered from twigs;\r\nThis year the omens of autumn are different. \r\n\r\nThis world lacks the depth to understand my heartache;\r\nPlease endow me with melodies, for my cry is different!\r\n\r\nOne disconcerting glance bared my being;\r\nNow in barren fields my visions are different. \r\n\r\nNo more troops, nor flags. Neither money, nor fame.\r\nThe marks of the monarchs on this land are different. \r\n\r\nMen are not martyred for their beloveds these days. \r\nThe youths of my youth were so very different!\r\n\r\nNasir Kazmi Couplets\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child learning to write \r\nmy first scribblings were your name.\r\nNasir Kazmi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhen my feet lost the path\r\nwhere was your hand?\r\nNasir Kazmi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEverything I found is yours;\r\neverything I lost is also yours.\r\nNasir Kazmi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory\r\nby  \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz, as performed by Iqbal Bano \r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn the wastelands of solitude, my love, \r\nthe echoes of your voice quiver,\r\nthe mirages of your lips waver. \r\n\r\nIn the deserts of alienation, \r\nout of the expanses of distance and isolation\'s debris\r\nthe fragrant jasmines and roses of your presence delicately blossom. \r\n\r\nNow from somewhere nearby, \r\nthe warmth of your breath rises, \r\nsmoldering forth an exotic perfumegently, languorously.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow far-off, across the distant horizon, \r\ndrop by shimmering drop, \r\nfall the glistening dews of your beguiling glances. \r\n\r\nWith such tenderness and affectionoh my love! \r\nyour memory has touched my heart\'s cheek so that it now \r\nseems \r\nthe sun of separation has set; the night of blessed union has arrived.\r\n\r\nSpeak!\r\nby \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSpeak, if your lips are free.\r\nSpeak, if your tongue is still your own.\r\nWhile your body is still upright,\r\nSpeak if your life is still your own.\r\n\r\nTonight \r\nby \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nDo not strike the melancholy chord tonight!\r\nDays smoldering \r\nwith pain in the end produce only listless ashes ...\r\nand who the hell knows what the future may bring?\r\nLast nights long lost, tomorrow\'s horizons a wavering \r\nmirage. \r\nAnd how can we know if well see another dawn?\r\nLife is nothing, unless together we make it ring!\r\nTonight we are love gods! Sing!\r\nDo not strike the melancholy chord tonight!\r\nDont harp constantly on human suffering!\r\nStop complaining; let Fate conduct her song! \r\nGive no thought to the future, seize now, this precious thing! \r\nShed no more tears for temperate seasons departed! \r\nAll sighs of the brokenhearted soon weakly dissipate ... stop dithering!\r\nOh, do not strike the same flat chord again! Sing!\r\n\r\nWhen Autumn Came\r\nby \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nSo it was that autumn came to flay the trees,\r\nto strip them nude,\r\nto rudely abase their slender dark bodies. \r\nFall fell in vengeance on the dying leaves,\r\nflung them down to the floor of the forest\r\nwhere anyone could trample them to mush\r\nundeterred by their sighs of protest. \r\nThe birds that herald spring\r\nwere exiled from their songs\r\nthe notes ripped from their sweet throats,\r\nthey plummeted to the earth below, undone\r\neven before the hunter strung his bow. \r\nPlease, gods of May, have mercy! \r\nBless these disintegrating corpses\r\nwith the passion of your resurrection;\r\nallow their veins to pulse with blood again. \r\nLet at least one tree remain green.\r\nLet one bird sing.\r\n\r\nLast Night (II)\r\nby \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLast night, your lost memory returned ...\r\nas spring steals silently into barren gardens,\r\nas cool breezes stir desert sands,\r\nas an ailing man suddenly feels better, for no apparent reason ...\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by  \r\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz later on this \r\npage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGhazal\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nNot the blossomings of songs nor the adornments of music:\r\nI am the voice of my own heart breaking. \r\nYou toy with your long, dark curls\r\nwhile I remain captive to my dark, pensive thoughts. \r\nWe congratulate ourselves that we two are different\r\nbut\r\nthis weakness has burdened us both with inchoate grief. \r\nNow you are here, and I find myself bowing\r\nas if sadness is a blessing, and longing a sacrament. \r\nI am a fragment of sound rebounding;\r\nyou are the walls impounding my echoes.\r\n\r\nThe Mistake\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAll your life, O Ghalib, \r\nYou kept repeating the same mistake:\r\nYour face was dirty \r\nBut you were obsessed with cleaning the mirror!\r\n\r\nInquiry\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe miracle of your absence \r\nis that I found myself endlessly searching for you. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s Only My Heart!\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIts only my heart, not unfeeling stone, \r\nso why be dismayed when it throbs with pain?\r\nIt was made to suffer ten thousand darts;\r\nwhy let one more torment impede us?\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by  \r\nMirza Ghalib later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouplets\r\nby Jaun Elia\r\nloose translations by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI am strangeso strange\r\nthat I self-destructed and don\'t regret it.\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe wound is deepcompanions, friendsembrace me!\r\nWhat, did you not even bother to stay?\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy nature is so strange\r\nthat today I felt relieved when you didn\'t arrive.\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNight and day I awaited myself;\r\nnow you return me to myself.\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nGreeting me this cordially,\r\nhave you so easily\r\nerased my memory?\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYour lips have provided thousands of answers;\r\nso what is the point of complaining now?\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPerhaps I haven\'t fallen in love with anyone, \r\nbut at least I convinced them!\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe city of mystics has become bizarre:\r\neveryone is wary of majesty, have you heard? \r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDid you just say Love is eternal?\r\nIs this the end of us?\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou are drawing very close to me!\r\nHave you decided to leave?\r\nJaun Elia, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nIntimacy\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI held the Sun, Stars and Moon at a distance\r\ntill the time your hands touched mine.\r\nNow I am not a feather to be easily detached:\r\ninstruct the hurricanes and tornados to observe their limits! \r\nThe Mad Moon\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nStars have a habit of showing off,\r\nbut the mad moon sojourns in darkness. \r\nBody Language\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour bodys figures are written in cursive!\r\nHow will I read you? Hand me the book! \r\nInsatiable \r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis mighty ocean, so deep and vast!\r\nIf it sates my thirst, how long can it last?\r\nHonor\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAchievements may fade but the name remains strong;\r\nwalls may buckle but the roof stays on.\r\nOn a pile of corpses a child stands alone\r\nand declares that his family still lives on! \r\nDust in the Wind\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThis is how I introduce myself to questioners:\r\nPick up a handful of dust, then blow ... \r\nDissembler\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn your eyes this, in your heart that, on your lips something else?\r\nIf this is how you are, impress someone else!\r\n\r\nRumor (M)ill\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI heard rumors my health was bad; still\r\nit was\r\nprying people who made me ill.\r\nThe Vortex\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI am the river whose rapids form a vortex;\r\nYou were wise to avoid my banks. \r\nHomebound\r\nby Rahat Indori\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIf people fear what they meet at every turn,\r\nwhy do they ever leave the house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecoming One\r\nby Amir Khusrow\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI have become you, as you have become me;\r\nI am your body, you my Essence.\r\nNow no one can ever say\r\nthat you are someone else, \r\nor that I am anything less than your Presence!\r\nI Am a Pagan\r\nby Amir Khusrow\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI am a pagan disciple of love: I need no creeds.\r\nMy every vein has become taut, like a tuned wire.\r\nI do not need the Brahman\'s girdle.\r\nLeave my bedside, ignorant physician!\r\nThe only cure for love is the sight of the patient\'s beloved:\r\nthere is no other medicine he needs!\r\nIf our boat lacks a pilot, let there be none:\r\nwe have god in our midst: we do not fear the sea!\r\nThe people say Khusrow worships idols:\r\nTrue! True! But he does not need other people\'s approval;\r\nhe does not need the world\'s. \r\n(My translation above was informed by a translation of Dr. Hadi Hasan.)\r\nAmir Khusrows elegy for his mother\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nWherever you shook the dust from your feet\r\nis my relic of paradise!\r\nParadise\r\nby Amir Khusrow\r\nloose translation/interpretation by\r\nMichael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nTen thousand desires: each one worth dying for ...\r\nSo many fulfilled, and yet still I yearn for more!\r\n\r\nBeing in love, for me there was no difference between living and dying ...\r\nand so I lived each dying breath watching you, my lovely Infidel, sighing \r\nafar. \r\n\r\nGhazal\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nLife becomes even more complicated\r\nwhen a man cant think like a man ... \r\nWhat irrationality makes me so dependent on her\r\nthat I rush off an hour early, then get annoyed when she\'s late? \r\nMy lover is so striking! She demands to be seen.\r\nThe mirror reflects only her image, yet still dazzles and confounds my eyes. \r\nLoves stings have left me the deep scar of happiness\r\nwhile she hovers above me, illuminated. \r\nShe promised not to torment me, but only after I was mortally wounded.\r\nHow easily she repents, my lovely slayer! \r\n\r\nGhazal\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nIts time for the world to hear Ghalib again!\r\nMay these words and their shadows like doors remain open. \r\nTonight the watery mirror of stars appears\r\nwhile night-blooming flowers gather where beauty rests. \r\nShe who knows my desire is speaking,\r\nor at least her lips have recently moved me. \r\nWhy is grief the fundamental element of night\r\nwhen blindness falls as the distant stars rise? \r\nTell me, how can I be happy, vast oceans from home\r\nwhen mail from my beloved lies here, so recently opened?\r\n\r\nAbstinence?\r\nby \r\nMirza Ghalib\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nLove requires patience but lust is relentless;\r\nwhat colors must my heart bleed before it expires?\r\n\r\nThere are more English translations of poems by  \r\nMirza Ghalib later on this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Explanation!

Burch\r\n\r\nCome, see this dance, the immaculate dance of the devadasi!\r\nMiraji, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEchoes of an ancient prophecy:\r\nwhen my life has come and gone, \r\nwhen I am dead and done,\r\nperhaps someone \r\n \r\nhearing again in a distant spring\r\nwill echo my songs \r\nthe world over.\r\nMiraji, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIf I understand things correctly, Miraji wrote the lines above after translating \r\na verse by Sappho in which she said that her poems would be remembered in the \r\nfuture.

Burch\r\n\r\nEverywhere and in every direction we see innumerable people:\r\neach man a victim of his own loneliness, reticence and silences.\r\nFrom dawn to dusk men carry enormous burdens:\r\nall preparing graves for their soon-to-be corpses. \r\nEach day a man lives, the same day he dies.\r\nEach new day requires the same old patience.\r\nIn every direction there are roads for him to roam,\r\nbut in every direction, men victimize men.\r\nEvery day a man dies many deaths only to resurrect from his ashes.\r\nEach new day presents new challenges. \r\nLife\'s destiny is not fixed, but a series of journeys:\r\nthus, till his last breath, a man remains restless.\r\n\r\nCouplets\r\nby Nida Fazli\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nIm a child of this dreary century, a child who never grew up.\r\nDoubts that ignited my tongue singed my wings.\r\nI learned to walk, then I unlearned progress.\r\nI grew weary of oases and camels infatuated with ruins.\r\nMy head inclined East only to occupy the middle of the road \r\nas I awaited the insane caravans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNostalgia \r\nby Abdulla Pashew (a Kurdish poet)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nThe earth and sky remained unknown to me\r\nThe expanse of my mother\'s bosom was my only world\r\n\r\nHer every movement communicated life\'s pleasures to me\r\nYet my own voice conveyed only meaningless words\r\n\r\nDuring infancy\'s pain, if someone made me cry \r\n\r\nThe clank of the door chain would comfort me\r\n\r\nOh! How I stared at the moon those long, lonely hours,\r\nRegarding its silent journey through broken clouds\r\n\r\nI would ask repeatedly about its mountains and plains\r\nOnly to be surprised by some prudent lie\r\n\r\nMy eye was devoted to seeing, my lips to speech\r\nMy heart was inquisitiveness personified\r\n\r\nFiction\r\nby Allama Iqbal\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhy didn\'t you make me immortal?\r\nBeauty asked God, perplexed.\r\n\r\nGod, vexed, \r\nreplied: The world is a fiction\r\nfashioned from emptiness.\r\n\r\nYou were born bright, ever-changing:\r\ntrue beauty is transient, estranging.\r\n\r\nThe moon picked up their discord\r\nand\r\nbeamed it on to the morning star\r\n\r\nwho informed dawn\'s clouds of her dark secret.\r\nThe dew overheard it all, formed a tear\r\n\r\nand drenched the shivering rose petals\r\n(now survived by the hardier nettles).\r\n\r\nDestiny\r\nby Allama Iqbal\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIsn\'t it futile to complain about God\'s will,\r\nWhen you are your own destiny? \r\n\r\nExcerpts from The Tulip of Sinai \r\nby Allama Iqbal\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMy heart is bright, from burning inwardly.\r\nMy eyes weep blood, for all the world to see.\r\nAm I the fool, or is it only he\r\nWho calls all Love mere wild insanity! \r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLove grants the garden soft breezes of May.\r\nLove teaches the meadow sunflowers to be gay.\r\nLove rockets bright rays even into the deep\r\nSo that fishes\' schools can find their way.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nLove reckons the price of eagles cheap.\r\nLove surrenders pheasants to the falcons steep\r\nMurderous dives. Our offended hearts weep\r\ntill suddenly, out of ambush, Love leaps!\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nLove paints the tulip petals hue.\r\nLove stirs the spirits bitter rue.\r\nAnd, should you could cleave this carrion clay,\r\nYou would behold Loves bloodshed too.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nA spent scent in a garden: hopes expire.\r\nI know not what I seek, no, nor require.\r\nBut whether I am satisfied, or starved,\r\nStill here I burn: a martyr to desire. \r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nHow long, my heart, will you be like the moth,\r\nInfatuated with a bit of cloth\r\nOr winking flame? Just once, my foolish heart,\r\nBe fully consumed in yourself, or depart.\r\n\r\nExcerpts from Cordoba\r\nby Allama Iqbal\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n...\r\nAnd yet in this form\r\nHues of eternal life\r\nSplendor of man\'s love\r\nLove, life\'s foundation\r\nDeath has no claim on love\r\nLove, the tide\r\nStemming the torrent\r\nLove, the nameless eras\r\nLove, Gabriel\'s breath\r\nLove, the Prophet of God\r\nLove, the Word of God\r\nLove, the radiant rose\r\nLove, the transcendent wine\r\nLove, the goblet of kings\r\nLove, life\'s music\r\nLove, the passion for life\r\nLove, the fire of life\r\n\r\n...\r\nA drop of blood turns\r\nStone to beating hearts\r\nThe heart\'s cry is joy\r\nIllumination and melody\r\nYou brighten my heart\r\nMy song wells up in my breast\r\nYou draw man\'s heart\r\nInto the presence of God\r\nBut the passion of love\r\nFor God is man\'s alone\r\nI ignite man\'s passion\r\nThough his sight is finite\r\nHis heart\'s more expansive than the sky\r\nSo what if God desires, rules?\r\nHe doesn\'t earn the pain!\r\nI am an Indian infidel\r\nWitness my fervor\r\nIn my heart, prayers\r\nOn my lips, blessings\r\nLove is my flute\r\nLove, my song\r\nIn my every bone\r\nGod is God\r\n\r\n...\r\nYet the world is illusion\r\nThe man of God is reason\'s horizon\r\nThe harvest of love\r\nThe fire of the ingathering\r\nHeaven\'s passion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDilemma\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhile\r\nI reject your absence,\r\nI find your presence equally intolerable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are links to other translations by Michael R.
