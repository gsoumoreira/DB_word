I\'ve long felt that I owe much of my success as a poet to \r\nMerlyn  Co., because my career didn\'t really take off until I became inspired \r\nto write about the real Arthur, who may have been historical, but \r\nwas almost certainly was not a Christian knight in shining armor. His original \r\nname was probably Artur or Artosboth mean the Bear. So he was probably a big, strong, burly man. The ancient Celts \r\nwere renowned for their ferociousness in battle, but they were also known for \r\ntheir mysticism, gregariousness and love of art: poetry, music, bright colors, \r\ngolden torques, etc. The British Celts fought against equally ferocious invaders such \r\nas the Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Vikings, and were slowly assimilated \r\ninto what we now call the English. They remain with us in many ways, including \r\ntheir tales of the otherworld and supernatural events such as a once and \r\nfuture king who pulled a magical sword from a stone with the help of the \r\nwildest and wiliest of mages. Their names have become the stuff of legend in \r\ntheir Christianized forms: Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Galahad, \r\nPercival, Bedivere, Kay, Gawain, Geraint, Gaheris, Gareth, Lionel, Lucan, Bors, \r\nLamorak, Palamedes, Agravain, Owain, Igraine, Tristram/Tristan, Isolde, \r\nMorgause, Mordred, Uther Pendragon, Ambrosius, Vortigern, Ector, Pellinore, et \r\nal. (Editors, anthologists and archivists please note that the poems included \r\nhere are the definitive versions.)  Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tintagel\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe legend of what happened on a dark and stormy night at Tintagel is endlessly \r\nintriguing. Supposedly, Merlin transformed Uther Pendragon to look like Gorlois so that Uther could sleep with Ygraine, the lovely wife of the \r\nunlucky duke. While Uther was enjoying Ygraines lovemaking, Gorlois was off getting himself killed. Did Igraine suspect that her lover \r\nwas not her husband? In any case, Artur/Artos/Arthur was the child conceived out of this supernatural (?) encounter.\r\n\r\nThat night,\r\nat Tintagel,\r\nthere was darkness such as man had never seen ...\r\ndarkness and treachery,\r\nand the unholy thundering of the sea ...\r\n\r\nIn his arms,\r\nwho can say how much she knew?\r\nAnd if he whispered her name ...\r\nYgraine!\r\n...\r\ncould she tell above the howling wind and rain?\r\n\r\nCould she tell, or did she care,\r\nby the length of his hair\r\nor the heat of his flesh, ...\r\nthat her faceless companion\r\nwas Uther, the dragon,\r\n\r\nand Gorlois lay dead?\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Songs of Innocence, then subsequently by Celtic Twilight, Fables, Fickle \r\nMuses and Poetry Life  Times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsoldes Song\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAccording to legend, Isolde and Tristram/Tristan were lovers who died, were buried close to each other, then reunited in the form of plants \r\ngrowing out of their graves. A rose emerged from Isolde\'s grave, a vine from Tristram\'s, then the two became one. Tristram was the Celtic \r\nOrpheus, a minstrel whose songs set women and even nature a-flutter.\r\n\r\nThrough our long years of dreaming to be one\r\nwe grew toward an enigmatic light\r\nthat gently warmed our tendrils. Was it sun?\r\nWe had no eyes to tell; we loved despite\r\nthe lack of all sensationall but one:\r\nwe felt the nights deep chill, the air so bright\r\nat dawn we quivered limply, overcome.\r\n\r\nTo touch was all we knew, and how to bask.\r\nWe knew to touch; we grew to touch; we felt\r\nsprings urgency, midsummers heat, falls lash,\r\nwild winters ice and thaw and fervent melt.\r\nWe felt returning light and could not ask\r\nits meaning, or if something was withheld\r\nmore glorious. To touch seemed lifes great task.\r\n\r\nAt last the petal of me learned: unfold\r\nand you were there, surrounding me. We touched.\r\nThe curious golden pollens! Ah, we touched,\r\nand learned to cling and, finally, to hold.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer-Eve\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the mysterious Tuatha De Danann, to the Ban \r\nShee (from which we get the term banshee) and, eventually, to the druids? One \r\nmight assume that with the passing of Merlyn, Morgause and their ilk, the time \r\nof myths and magic ended. This poem is an epitaph of sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ruins\r\nof the dreams\r\nand the schemes\r\nof men;\r\n\r\nwhen the moon\r\nbegets the tide\r\nand the wide\r\nsea sighs;\r\n\r\nwhen a star\r\nappears in heaven\r\nand the raven\r\ncries;\r\n\r\nwe will dance\r\nand we will revel\r\nin the devils\r\nfen ...\r\n\r\nif nevermore again.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Penny Dreadful\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pictish Faeries \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nSmaller and darker\r\nthan their closest kin,\r\nthe faeries learned only too well\r\nnever to dwell\r\nclose to the villages of larger men. \r\nOnly to dance in the starlight\r\nwhen the moon was full\r\nand men were afraid.\r\nOnly to worship in the farthest glade,\r\never heeding the raven and the gull.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kiss of Ceridwen \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThe kiss of Ceridwen\r\nI have felt upon my brow,\r\nand the past and the future\r\nhave appeared, as though a vapor,\r\nmingling with the here and now. \r\nAnd Morrigan, the Raven,\r\nthe messenger, has come,\r\nto tell me that the gods, unsung,\r\nwill not last long\r\nwhen the druids harps grow dumb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Hunt\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOur Halloween, my wife Beth\'s favorite holiday along with Christmas, is an \r\ninheritance from the ancient Celts. The Celts believed that the otherworld can \r\nsometimes merge with the real world, so that elves, fairies, witches, warlocks \r\nand other fantastical entities are able to either help or harm human beings. \r\nBedwyr was later Christianized as Bedivere. \r\n\r\nNear Devon, the hunters appear in the sky\r\nwith Artur and Bedwyr sounding the call;\r\nand the others, laughing, go dashing by.\r\nThey only appear when the moon is full:\r\n\r\nValerin, the King of the Tangled Wood,\r\nand Valynt, the goodly King of Wales,\r\nGawain and Owain and the hearty men\r\nwho live on in many minstrels tales.\r\n\r\nThey seek the white stag on a moonlit moor,\r\nor Torc Triath, the fabled boar,\r\nor Ysgithyrwyn, or Twrch Trwyth,\r\nthe other mighty boars of myth.\r\n\r\nThey appear, sometimes, on Halloween\r\nto chase the moon across the green,\r\nthen fade into the shadowed hills\r\nwhere memory alone prevails.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Celtic Twilight, then by Celtic Lifestyles and Auldwicce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgauses Song\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAccording to legend, Morgause was Arthur\'s half-sister. She seduced him and their son Mordred grew up to bring about the division of \r\nArthur\'s kingdom, and his death. \r\n\r\nBefore he was my brother,\r\nhe was my lover,\r\nthough certainly not the best.\r\n\r\nI found no joy\r\nin that addled boy,\r\nnor he at my breast.\r\n\r\nWhy him? Why him?\r\nThe years grow dim.\r\nIt grows harder and harder to say ...\r\n\r\nPerhaps girls and boys\r\nare the gods toys\r\nwhen the skies are gray.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Celtic Twilight as The First Time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPellinores Fancy\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nKing Pellinore spent most of his time hunting an elusive questing beast ... \r\nor was it just an excuse not to go home to the nagging missus?\r\n\r\nWhat do you do when your wife is a nag\r\nand has sworn you to hunt neither fish, fowl, nor stag?\r\nWhen the land is at peace, but at home you have none,\r\nIs that, perchance, when the Questing Beasts run?\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthern Flight: Lancelots Last Love Letter to Guinevere \r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nGet thee to a nunnery . . .\r\nNow that the days have lengthened, I assume\r\nthe shadows also lengthen where you pause\r\nto watch the sun and comprehend its laws,\r\nor just to shiver in the deepening gloom. \r\nBut nothing in your antiquarian eyes\r\nnor anything beyond your failing vision\r\nrepeals the night. Religions circumcision\r\nhas left us worlds apart, but whos more wise? \r\nI think I know you better now than then\r\nand love you all the more, because you are\r\n. . . so distant. I can love you from afar,\r\nforgiving your flight north, far from brute men,\r\nbecause your fears well-founded: God, forbid,\r\nwas bound to fail you here, as mortals did. \r\n\r\nOriginally published by Rotary Dial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Enchantment\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis poem imagines Arthur speaking to his best friend, Lancelot, in some hazy underworld about Merlin\'s last enchantment, which was \r\nsupposed to restore him to power ...\r\n\r\nOh, Lancelot, my truest friend,\r\nhow time has thinned your ragged mane\r\nand pinched your features; still you seem\r\nthough, much, much changedsomehow unchanged.\r\n\r\nYour sword hand is, as ever, ready,\r\nalthough the time for swords has passed.\r\nYour eyes are fierce, and yet so steady\r\nmeeting mine ... you must not ask.\r\n\r\nThe time is not, nor ever shall be.\r\nMerlyns words were only words;\r\nand now his last enchantment wanes,\r\nand we must put aside our swords ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLance-Lot\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nPreposterous bird!\r\nInelegant! Absurd! \r\nUntil the great  mighty heron\r\nbrandishes his fearsome sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruces\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe must sometimes wonder if all the fighting related to King \r\nArthur and his knights was really necessary. In particular, it seems that \r\nLancelot fought and either captured or killed a fairly large percentage of the \r\npopulation of England. Could it be that Arthur preferred to fight than stay at \r\nhome and do domestic chores? And, honestly now, if he and his knights were such \r\nincredible warriors, who would have been silly enough to do battle with them? \r\nWygar was the name of Arthurs hauberk, or armored tunic, which was supposedly \r\nfashioned by one Witege or Widia, quite possibly the son of Wayland Smith. \r\nThe legends suggest that Excalibur was forged upon the anvil of the \r\nsmith-god Wayland, who was also known as Volund, which sounds suspiciously like \r\nVulcan ...\r\n\r\n\r\nArtur took Cabal, his hound,\r\nand Carwennan, his knife,\r\nand his sword forged by Wayland\r\nand Merlyn, his falcon,\r\nand, saying goodbye to his sons and his wife,\r\nhe strode to the Table Rounde.\r\n\r\nHere is my spear, Rhongomyniad,\r\nand here is Wygar that I wear,\r\nand ready for war,\r\nan oath I foreswore\r\nto fight for all that is righteous and fair\r\nfrom Wales to the towers of Gilead.\r\n\r\nBut none could be found to contest him,\r\nfor Lancelot had slewn them, forsooth,\r\nso he hastened back home, for to rest him,\r\ntill his wife bade him, Thatch up the roof!\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Neovictorian/Cochlea, then by Celtic Twilight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall Tales\r\n\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to legend, Arthur and Kay grew up together in Ectors \r\ncourt, Kay being a few years older than Arthur. Borrowing from Mary Stewart, I \r\nam assuming that Bedwyr (later Anglicized to Bedivere) might have befriended \r\nArthur at an early age. By some accounts, Bedwyr was the original Lancelot. In \r\nany case, imagine the adventures these young heroes might have pursued (or \r\ndreamed up, to excuse tardiness or lost homework assignments). Manawydan and \r\nLlyr were ancient Welsh gods. Cath Pulag was a monstrous, clawing cat. (Sorry \r\nteach! My theme paper on Homer was torn up by a cat bigger than a dragon! And \r\nmeaner, too!) Pen Palach is more or less a mystery, or perhaps just another old \r\ndrinking buddy with a few good beery-bleary tales of his own. This poem assumes \r\nthat many of the more outlandish Arthurian legends began more or less as small \r\ntales, little white lies which simply got larger and larger with each \r\nretelling. It also assumes that most of these tales came about just as the lads \r\nreached that age when boys fancy themselves men, and spend most of their free \r\ntime drinking and puking . . . \r\n\r\nWhen Artur and Cai and Bedwyr\r\nwere but scrawny lads\r\nthey had many a boozy adventure\r\nin the still glades\r\nof Gwynedd.\r\nWhen the sun beat down like an oven\r\nupon the kiln-hot hills\r\nand the scorched shores of Carmarthen,\r\nthey went searching\r\nand found Manawydan, the son of Llyr.\r\nThey fought a day and a night\r\nwith Cath Pulag (or a screeching kitten),\r\nrousted Pen Palach, then drank a beer\r\nand told quite a talltale or two,\r\ntill thems wasnt so shore whichuns tails wus true. \r\nAnd these have been passed down to me, and to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerlyn, on His Birth\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLegend has it that Zephyr was an ancestor of Merlin. I suggest here that Merlin \r\nwas an albino, which could have led to \r\nclaims that he had no father, due to radical physical differences between father \r\nand son. This would have also added to his appearance as a mystical figure. The \r\nreference to Ursa Major, the bear, ties the birth of Merlin to the future birth \r\nof Arthur, whose Welsh name (Artos or Artur) \r\nmeans bear. Morydd is another possible ancestor of Merlins. The dd in \r\nWelsh names is pronounced th.\r\n\r\nI was born in Gwynedd,\r\nor not born, as some men claim,\r\nand the Zephyr of Caer Myrddin\r\ngave me my name.\r\n\r\nMy father was Madog Morfeyn\r\nbut our eyes were never the same,\r\nnor our skin, nor our hair;\r\nfor his were dark, dark\r\nas our peoples are\r\nand mine were fairer than fair.\r\n\r\nThe night of my birth, the Zephyr\r\ncarved of white stone a rune;\r\nand the ringed stars of Ursa Major\r\noutshone the cool pale moon;\r\nand my grandfather, Morydd, the seer\r\nsaw wheeling, a-gyre in the sky,\r\na falcon with terrible yellow-gold eyes\r\nwhen falcons never fly.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Songs of Innocence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerlyns First Prophecy\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nChild sacrifice was a terrible but supposedly potent form of magic. The \r\nblood of an albino child might have been thought to be particularly potent. This \r\npoem suggests how the ability to prophesy might have saved the young Merlyn \r\nfrom death. Ambrosius Pendragon defeated Vortigern and so established a new \r\ndynasty ... did Merlyn predict his ascendency, and so earn undying fame?\r\n\r\nVortigern commanded a tower to be built upon Snowden,\r\nbut the earth would churn and within an hour its walls would cave in.\r\n\r\nThen his druid said only the virginal blood of a fatherless son,\r\nrecently shed, would ever hold the foundation.\r\n\r\nThere is, in Caer Myrrdin, a faery lad, a son with no father;\r\nhis name is Merlyn, and with his blood you would have your tower.\r\n\r\nSo Vortigern had them bring the boy, the child of the demon,\r\nand, taciturn and without joy, looked out over Snowden.\r\n\r\nTo kill a child brings little praise, but many tears.\r\nThen the mountain slopes rang with the brays of Merlyns jeers.\r\n\r\nPure poppycock! You fumble and bumble and heed a fool.\r\nAt the base of the rock the foundations crumble into a pool!\r\n\r\nWhen they drained the pool, two dragons arose, one white and one red,\r\nand since the old druid was blowing his nose, young Merlyn said:\r\n\r\nVortigern is the white, Ambrosius the red; now, watch, indeed.\r\nThen the former died as the latter fed and Vortigern peed.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Celtic Twilight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUthers Last Battle\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nUther Pendragon was the father of Arthur, but he had given his son to the \r\nwily Merlyn and knew nothing of his whereabouts. Did Uther meet his son just \r\nbefore his death, as one of the legends suggests? \r\n\r\nWhen Uther, the High King,\r\nunable to walk, borne upon a litter\r\nwent to fight Colgrim, the Saxon King,\r\nhis legs were weak, and his visage bitter.\r\nWhere is Merlyn, the sage?\r\nFor today I truly feel my age.\r\n\r\nAll day long the battle raged\r\nand the dragon banner was sorely pressed,\r\nbut the courage of Uther never waned\r\ntill the sun hung low upon the west.\r\nOh, where is Merlyn to speak my doom,\r\nfor truly I feel the chill of the tomb.\r\n\r\nThen, with the battle almost lost\r\nand the king besieged on every side,\r\na prince appeared, clad all in white,\r\nand threw himself against the tide.\r\nOh, where is Merlyn, who stole my son?\r\nFor, truly, now my life is done.\r\n\r\nThen Merlyn came unto the king\r\nas the Saxons fled before a sword\r\nthat flashed like lightning in the hand\r\nof a prince that day become a lord.\r\nOh, Merlyn, speak not, for I see\r\nmy son has truly come to me.\r\n\r\nAnd today I need no prophecy\r\nto see how bright his days will be.\r\nSo Uther, then, the valiant king\r\nmet his son, and kissed him twice\r\nthe one, the first, the one, the last\r\nand smiled, and then his time was past.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Songs of Innocence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt Is NOT the Sword!\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis poem illustrates the strong correlation between the names \r\nthat appear in Welsh and Irish mythology. Much of this lore predates the \r\nArthurian legends, and was assimilated as Arthurs fame (and hyperbole) \r\ngrew. Caladbolg is the name of a mythical Irish sword, while Caladvwlch is its \r\nWelsh equivalent. Caliburn and Excalibur are later variants.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the sword,\r\nbut the man,\r\nsaid Merlyn.\r\nBut the people demanded a sign\r\nthe sword of Macsen Wledig,\r\nCaladbolg, the lightning-shard.\r\n\r\nIt is not the sword,\r\nbut the words men follow.\r\nStill, he set it in the stone\r\nCaladvwlch, the sword of kings\r\nand many a man did strive, and swore,\r\nand many a man did moan.\r\n\r\nBut none could budge it from the stone.\r\n\r\nIt is not the sword\r\nor the strength,\r\nsaid Merlyn,\r\nthat makes a man a king,\r\nbut the truth and the conviction\r\nthat ring in his iron word.\r\n\r\nIt is NOT the sword!\r\ncried Merlyn,\r\ncrowd-jostled, marveling\r\nas Arthur drew forth Caliburn\r\nwith never a gasp,\r\nwith never a word,\r\n\r\nand so became their king.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Songs of Innocence, then by Romantics Quarterly, \r\nNeovictorian/Cochlea and Celtic Twilight\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Song of Amergin\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nAmergin is, in the words of Morgan Llywelyn, the oldest known western \r\nEuropean poet. Robert Graves said: English poetic education should, really, \r\nbegin not with The Canterbury Tales, not with the Odyssey, not \r\neven with Genesis, but with the Song of Amergin. Amergin was \r\none of the Milesians, or sons of Mil: Gaels who invaded Ireland and defeated the \r\nmysterious Tuatha De Danann, thereby establishing a Celtic beachhead, not only \r\non the shores of the Emerald Isle, but also in the annals of Time and Poetry.\r\nHe was our first bard\r\nand we feel in his dim-remembered words\r\nthe moment when Time blurs . . . \r\nand he and the Sons of Mil\r\nheave oars as the breakers mill\r\ntill at last Iernegreen, broodingnears, \r\nwhile Some implore seas cold, fell, dark\r\nto climb and swamp their flimsy bark\r\n. . . and Time here also spumes, careers . . .\r\n\r\nwhile the Ban Shee shriek in awed dismay\r\nto see him still the sea, this day,\r\nthen seek the dolmen and the gloam.\r\n\r\n\r\nStonehenge\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nHere where the wind imbues life within stone,\r\nI once stood\r\nand watched as the tempest made monuments groan\r\nas though blood\r\nboiled within them. \r\nHere where the Druids stood charting the stars\r\nI can tell\r\nthey longed for the heavens ... perhaps because \r\nhell\r\nboiled beneath them?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Celtic Cross at \xcele Grosse\r\nby Michael R. Burch \r\nI actually visited the island and walked across those mass graves [of 30,000 \r\nIrish men, women and children], and I played a little tune on me whistle. I \r\nfound it very peaceful, and there was relief there.  Paddy Maloney of The \r\nChieftans \r\nThere was relief there,\r\nand release,\r\non \xcele Grosse \r\nin the spreading gorse\r\nand the cry of the wild geese . . . \r\nThere was relief there,\r\nwithout remorse\r\nwhen the tin whistle lifted its voice\r\nin a tune of artless grief,\r\npiping achingly high and longingly of an island veiled in myth.\r\nAnd the Celtic cross that stands here tells us, not of their grief,\r\nbut of their faith and belief\r\nlike the last soft breath of evening lifting a fallen leaf. \r\nWhen ravenous famine set all her demons loose,\r\ndriving men to the seas like lemmings,\r\nthey sought here the clemency of a better life, or death,\r\nand their belief in God gave them hope, a sense of peace. \r\nThese were proud men with only their lives to owe,\r\nwho sought the liberation of a strange new land.\r\nNow they lie here, ragged row on ragged row,\r\nwith only the shadows of their loved ones close at hand. \r\nAnd each cross, their ancient burden and their glory,\r\nreflects the death of sunlight on their story. \r\nAnd their tale is sadbut, O, their faith was grand! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt C\xe6dmons Grave\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmons Hymn, composed at the Monastery of Whitby (a North \r\nYorkshire fishing village), is one of the oldest known poems written in the \r\nEnglish language, dating back to around 680 A.D. According to legend, C\xe6dmon, an \r\nilliterate Anglo-Saxon cowherd, received the gift of poetic composition from an \r\nangel; he subsequently founded a school of Christian poets. Unfortunately, only \r\nnine lines of C\xe6dmons verse survive, in the writings of the Venerable Bede. \r\nWhitby, tiny as it is, reappears later in the history of English literature, \r\nhaving been visited, in diametric contrast, by Lewis Carroll and Bram Stokers \r\nghoulish yet evocative Dracula.\r\n\r\nAt the monastery of Whitby,\r\non a day when the sun sank through the sea,\r\nand the gulls shrieked wildly, jubilant, free,\r\n\r\nwhile the wind and time blew all around,\r\nI paced those dusk-enamored grounds\r\nand thought I heard the steps resound\r\n\r\nof Carroll, Stoker and good Bede\r\nwho walked there, too, their spirits freed\r\nperhaps by God, perhaps by need\r\n\r\nto write, and with each line, remember\r\nthe glorious light of C\xe6dmons ember,\r\nscorched tongues of flame words still engender.\r\n\r\nHere, as darkness falls, at last we meet.\r\nI lay this pale garland of words at his feet.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by The Lyric\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
