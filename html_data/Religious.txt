Which are the best poems ever written \r\nabout Christianity? Who are the best religious and spiritual poets, regardless of faith? Who \r\nwere the best heretical poets? (My favorite heretic is the Archpoet, a medieval Latin rogue \r\nscholar who boldly and baldly lampooned the Moral Majority of his day.) I will \r\nattempt to answer these and similar questions. Because religious/spiritual poetry \r\nwritten in English has been primarily Christian, most of the poems here will reflect  \r\nChristian sentiments or sentiments about Christianity. But many of these poems do \r\nnot adhere to \r\northodox Christian dogma. In fact, I believe they will lead us to an overwhelming question, to borrow a \r\nmemorable phrase from \r\nT. S. Eliot ...\r\n\r\nTop Ten Christian Poets: (10) Henry Vaughan, (9) George Herbert, (8) T. S. Eliot, (7) \r\nJohn Donne, (6) Gerard Manley Hopkins, (5) Christina Rossetti, (4) Emily \r\nDickinson, (3) William Blake, (2) John Milton, (1) Dante \r\nTop Ten Spiritual Poets: (10) King David, (9) King Solomon, (8) John Donne, (7) \r\nSt. John of the Cross, (6) Gerard Manley Hopkins, (5) Emily Dickinson, (4) Rumi, (3) \r\nHafiz, (2) Walt Whitman, (1) William Blake\r\nTop Ten Heretical Poets: (10) King Solomon, (9) The Archpoet, (8) e. e. \r\ncummings, (7) Robert Frost, (6) Robert Burns, (5) Lord Byron, (4) Percy Bysshe \r\nShelley, (3) A. E. Housman, (2) William Blake, (1) Walt Whitman\r\nTop Ten Reformers: (10) Hebrew prophets, (9) Saint Paul, (8) John Lennon, (7) \r\nBob Dylan, (6) John Milton, (5) Robert Burns, (4) Wilfred Owen, (3) Langston Hughes, (2) Walt Whitman, (1) William Blake\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: St. Francis of Assisi, Emily Bronte, G. K. Chesterton, \r\nWilliam Cowper, Ralph Waldo Emerson, C. S. Lewis, \r\nMartin Luther, Thomas Merton,Michelangelo, St. Teresa of Avila, Isaac \r\nWatts, Charles Wesley \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake was perhaps the most spiritual of English poets: he was a mystic \r\nwho claimed to be able to see and converse with angels and saints. Blake, the \r\ngreatest prophet and reformer among England\'s poets, enjoined his readers to \r\nenter the mental fight against the Satanic mills of what Dwight D. \r\nEisenhower would later call the military/industrial complex. Blake was also \r\nlight years ahead of his time on matters such as racism, abolishing slavery, \r\nfree love, and establishing the human rights and equality of women and children. \r\nBut as we will see, there was something highly unusual about his faith ...\r\n\r\nJerusalem\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\r\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\r\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\r\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\r\n\r\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\r\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\r\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\r\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\r\n\r\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\r\nBring me my arrows of desire:\r\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\r\nBring me my chariot of fire.\r\n\r\nI will not cease from mental fight,\r\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\r\nTill we have built Jerusalem\r\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye may be the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ... but please take \r\nnote of the repetition of I am in her poem ...\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. Mary Elizabeth Frye had never written poetry before, or at least nothing \r\nof note. She wrote this one on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nWalt Whitman was America\'s most spiritual and most prophetic poet. Like William \r\nBlake, Whitman was a mystic. But there was something unusual about Whitman\'s \r\nfaith ...\r\n\r\nExcerpt from Song of Myself\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full\r\nhands;\r\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any\r\nmore than he.\r\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful\r\ngreen stuff woven.\r\nOr I guess if is the handkerchief of the Lord,\r\nA scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\r\nBearing the owner\'s name someway in the corners, that we\r\nmay see and remark, and say Whose?\r\n\r\nA. E. Housman wrote some of the most powerful poems about religion in the \r\nEnglish language, but there was also something unusual about his faith ... \r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIIFor My Funeral\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nO thou that from thy mansion\r\n  Through time and place to roam,\r\nDost send abroad thy children,\r\n  And then dost call them home,\r\n\r\nThat men and tribes and nations\r\n  And all thy hand hath made\r\nMay shelter them from sunshine\r\n  In thine eternal shade:\r\n\r\nWe now to peace and darkness\r\n  And earth and thee restore\r\nThy creature that thou madest\r\n  And wilt cast forth no more.\r\n\r\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets, and this is a wonderfully \r\ntouching, moving prayer-poem, but he is like Housman in an important regard ...\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost may have been the last major American poet, and there is something \r\nunusual about his faith ...\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\nHopefully God, if he/she exists, has a sense of humor. Merrill is even more \r\nskeptical ... \r\n\r\n\r\nIn God We Trust\r\nby \r\nTom Merrill\r\n\r\nAbsolve yourselves, believe them saved,\r\nWhom hungrily you brought to fare\r\nAs chance decrees, and leave to them\r\nThe fortune to which you rose heir.\r\nNow theirs shall be the kingdom too,\r\nThis one and that, and all they hold,\r\nAll marvels present, and as well\r\nFresh wonders when the flesh turns cold.\r\n\r\nAll you who by blind pulse renew\r\nThe primal blessing cast in heat,\r\nAnd to a season\'s course entrust\r\nFrail issue weather can defeat,\r\nWho from flung seed grew anxious too\r\nDeny earth feeds on them and you. \r\n \r\nThe unusual thing about the poets quoted so far is that none of them were \r\northodox Christians. Blake was a mystic who denied the need to be saved by \r\nChrist, and Blake called the biblical god Nobodaddy because no one would want \r\nhim for a father. Whitman also denied the need to be saved by Christ. Housman \r\nwas an atheist, as is Merrill. Frost was a skeptic. Myself? I am an agnostic. \r\nSome of my poems are on \r\nreligious/spiritual/Christian themes, but I don\'t subscribe to the idea that \r\nsalvation by selective grace is a good thing. Here\'s one of my poems ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat would Santa Claus say, \r\nI wonder,\r\nabout Jesus returning \r\nto Kill and Plunder?\r\nFor hell likely return\r\non Christmas Day\r\nto blow the bad\r\nlittle boys away!\r\nWhen He flashes like lightning\r\nacross the skies\r\nand many a homosexual\r\ndies,\r\nwhen the harlots and heretics\r\nare ripped asunder,\r\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\r\nI wonder?\r\n\r\nOut of the mouths of babes, perhaps ... I sometimes write poems from the \r\nvantage point of a child questioning the prime tenets of Christian faith.\r\nHere\'s a poem by a contemporary poet who raises valid questions about the abuse \r\nof children by religious fanatics who preach the good news that \r\ninnocent children have been condemned to an eternal hell for the sin of \r\nhaving been born human ... \r\n\r\nThe Missionary\'s Position\r\nby Joseph S. Salemi\r\n\r\nI maintain it all was for the best\r\nWe hacked our way through jungle and sought out\r\nThese savage children, painted and half-dressed,\r\nTo set their minds at ease, and dispel doubt.\r\n\r\nConcerning what? Why, God\'s immense design,\r\nAnd how it governs all we do and see.\r\nBefore, they had no sense of the divine\r\nBeyond the sticks and bones of sorcery.\r\n\r\nGranted, they are more somber and subdued,\r\nKnowing that lives are watched, and judged, and weighed.\r\nSubject to fits of melancholy mood,\r\nThey look upon the cross, and are afraid.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have me say? We preached the Word\r\nBetter endured in grief than left unheard.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Merrill questions the tawdry business of salvation ... \r\n\r\n\r\nA Brief Alarm\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nLike everything, this too will soon be lost,\r\nForever out of sight and out of mind,\r\nA brief alarm resorbed into the sum\r\nOf passing things that leave no trace behind.\r\nFor its duration, it would summon all\r\nTo a restraint heroicto be brave\r\nBeyond all generations gone before,\r\nAnd make a sacrifice more sure to save:\r\n\r\nTo starve the ground, and lay no further feast\r\nFor bloated Earth\'s unflagging appetite,\r\nBut be content to plow redemptively\r\nA barren field in which no seed seeks light\r\nAnd make your plots the last wherein to toss\r\nA harvest raised for neverending loss.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a poem of mine in which I question the wisdom of God Almighty ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilly Nilly\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor the Demiurge, aka Jehovah\r\n\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days uphilly.\r\nThey ran till they dropped\r\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nThey say I should worship you!\r\nOh, really!\r\nThey say I should pray\r\nso youll not act illy.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a poem of mine that was influenced by e. e. cummings, perhaps most \r\nimportantly in its questioning of popular wisdom ...\r\n\r\ngimME that ol time religion!\r\nby michael r. burch\r\n\r\nfiddle-dee-dum, fiddle-dee-dee,\r\njesus loves and understands ME!\r\nsafe in his grace, ILL damn  them to hell\r\nthe strumpet, the  harlot, the wild  jezebel,\r\nthe  alky, the  druggie, all queers short and tall!\r\nlet  them drink ashes and wormwood and gall,\r\ncause fiddle-dee-DUMB, fiddle-dee-WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeee ...\r\njesus loves and understands\r\nME!\r\nIn this poem US means both the United States and us the people of the \r\nworld, wherever we live. The name jesus is uncapitalized while Room is \r\ncapitalized because it seems evangelical Christians are more concerned about \r\nland and not sharing it with the less fortunate, than the teachings of Jesus \r\nChrist. Also, Jesus and his parents were refugees for whom there was no Room \r\nto be found. What would Jesus think of Christian scorn for the less fortunate, \r\none wonders? What would he think of people adopting his name for their religion, \r\nthen voting for someone like Trump, as four out of five evangelical Christians \r\ndid, according to exit polls?\r\nwho, US? \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\njesus was born \r\na palestinian child\r\nwhere theres no Room \r\nfor the meek and the mild \r\n... and in bethlehem still \r\nto this day, lambs are born\r\nto cries of no Room! \r\nand Puritanical scorn ... \r\nunder Herod, Trump, Bibi\r\ntheir fates are the same  \r\nthe slouching Beast mauls them\r\nand WE have no shame ... \r\nwhos to blame?\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that poets are increasingly skeptical? ... \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any reward? \r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\nI am broken and bored,\r\nIs there any reward\r\nReassure me, Good Lord,\r\nAnd inform me about it.\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\n\r\nOther religious/spiritual poets of note include Maya Angelou, W.

The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\n...\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti was a devout Christian, but there was something unusual about \r\nher faith ...\r\n\r\n\r\nUphill \r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nDoes the road wind up-hill all the way?\r\n Yes, to the very end.\r\nWill the day\'s journey take the whole long day?\r\n From morn to night, my friend.\r\n\r\nBut is there for the night a resting-place?\r\n A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\r\nMay not the darkness hide it from my face?\r\n You cannot miss that inn.\r\n\r\nShall I meet other wayfarers at night?\r\n Those who have gone before.\r\nThen must I knock, or call when just in sight?\r\n They will not keep you standing at that door.\r\n\r\nShall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?\r\n Of labour you shall find the sum.\r\nWill there be beds for me and all who seek?\r\n Yea, beds for all who come.\r\n\r\nGerard Manley Hopkins is one of the great devotional poets, but there was \r\nalso something unusual about his faith ...\r\nThe Windhover by Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\'s a poem in which e. e. cummings, one of the most spiritual of American \r\npoets, questions the comfortable minds of \r\nChristians ... \r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls \r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\nare unbeautiful and have comfortable minds\r\n(also, with the church\'s protestant blessings\r\ndaughters, unscented shapeless spirited)\r\nthey believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,\r\nare invariably interested in so many things\r\nat the present writing one still finds\r\ndelighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?\r\nperhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy\r\nscandal of Mrs. N and Professor D\r\n.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above\r\nCambridge if sometimes in its box of\r\nsky lavender and cornerless, the\r\nmoon rattles like a fragment of angry candy \r\n\r\nI find it interesting that none of the poets so far seem to have been orthodox \r\nChristians. William Blake detested the black-robed priests of orthodox \r\nChristianity who nailed a Thou shalt not sign above his garden of earthly \r\nsexual delights. Blake did not believe in the atonement and saw God only \r\nin the divinity of man. For Blake, as with the mystics of many religions, \r\nthe divinity of God and the divinity of man were the same thing. Like the \r\nGnostics, Blake saw the God of the Old Testament as being the Devil and called \r\nhim Nobodaddy.\r\n\r\nWhitman was also a mystic, not an orthodox Christian. He saw God in all human \r\nbeings (including criminals and prostitutes) and all life, even blades of grass. \r\nHe did not believe in the atonement and was the first major Western poet to \r\nwrite openly on homosexual themes.\r\n\r\nWhile at first glance Gerard Manley Hopkins might appear to be an orthodox \r\nChristian, his best poems were about nature, not the atonement, and he said \r\nhimself that he was the near-twin of the notorious heretic and homosexual Whitman. \r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti, like many of the other poets on this page, seems to have \r\nbeen a universalist. When she wrote, Will there be beds for me and all who seek? \r\n/ Yea, beds for all who come, she seems to have invoked the belief of \r\nuniversalists: that all human beings will be saved. But then faith in Jesus \r\nChrist cannot be a requirement for salvation. Many of the best \r\nChristian/devotional/spiritual poets have been reputed to be universalists, \r\nincluding Walt Whitman, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett \r\nBrowning, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Emily Bronte, \r\nCharlotte Bronte, Robert Burns, Matthew Arnold, Alexander Pope, Ralph Waldo \r\nEmerson and Walter Savage Landor, among others. \r\n\r\nIn fact, it\'s hard to find an orthodox Christian among the best \r\nspiritual/religious poets, as the poems following on this page will attest. Even \r\nthe two greatest Christian poets of all time gave scant attention to the \r\natonement ...\r\nExcerpt from Paradise Lost\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nAnd chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer\r\nBefore all Temples th\' upright heart and pure,\r\nInstruct me, for Thou know\'st; Thou from the first\r\nWast present, and with mighty wings outspread\r\nDove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss\r\nAnd mad\'st it pregnant: What in me is dark\r\nIllumine, what is low raise and support;\r\nThat to the height of this great Argument\r\nI may assert Eternal Providence,\r\nAnd justify the ways of God to men.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton gave the atonement a single embarrassed enjambed line in his great \r\nepic, Paradise Lost. After promising to justify the way of God to men, \r\nMilton made Adam, Eve and Satan romantic heroes for the ages, while relegating \r\nJesus Christ a minor role. William Blake said that Milton was of the Devil\'s \r\nparty, which he meant as a compliment, since Blake believed rebellion against \r\nthe status quo was necessary for man to achieve full divinity. \r\nExcerpt from Paradiso\r\nby Dante\r\nLike sudden lightning scattering the spirits\r\nof sight so that the eye is then too weak\r\nto act on other things it would perceive,\r\nsuch was the living light encircling me,\r\nleaving me so enveloped by its veil\r\nof radiance that I could see no thing.\r\nThe Love that calms this heaven always welcomes\r\ninto Itself with such a salutation,\r\nto make the candle ready for its flame.\r\n\r\nDante, seemingly the most Christian of poets, was saved in his poems not by \r\nJesus, but by Beatrice and Virgil (a pagan poet). \r\n\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct\r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive \r\npigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\r\nJohn Lennon\'s Imagine is one of the best-known and best-loved anti-religion \r\nlyrics ... \r\n\r\nImagine\r\nby John Lennon\r\n\r\nImagine there\'s no Heaven\r\nIt\'s easy if you try\r\nNo hell below us\r\nAbove us only sky\r\nImagine all the people\r\nLiving for today ... \r\n\r\nImagine there\'s no countries\r\nIt isn\'t hard to do\r\nNothing to kill or die for\r\nAnd no religion too\r\nImagine all the people\r\nLiving life in peace ...\r\n\r\nYou may say that I\'m a dreamer\r\nBut I\'m not the only one\r\nI hope someday you\'ll join us\r\nAnd the world will be as one\r\n\r\nImagine no possessions\r\nI wonder if you can\r\nNo need for greed or hunger\r\nA brotherhood of man\r\nImagine all the people\r\nSharing all the world ...\r\n\r\nYou may say that I\'m a dreamer\r\nBut I\'m not the only one\r\nI hope someday you\'ll join us\r\nAnd the world will live as one\r\n\r\nRobert Frost (1874-1963) is one of the best-known American poets of all time, \r\nand perhaps the last major American poet to be acclaimed by literary critics and \r\nthe reading public. Frost stands with Mark Twain as one of the foremost \r\nAmerican critics of orthodox Christianity, as attested by poems of his like A \r\nQuestion and Forgive O Lord. Directive (below) is an under-known and \r\nunder-appreciated poem today, but one well worth reading and considering, as \r\nFrost illustrates the darkness of a religion that insists the chosen few are \r\npredestined for eternal glory while (as Saint Mark said), other people are \r\ndeliberately led astray by God to their eternal doom. Directive with its guide \r\nwho only has at heart your getting lost and its sign CLOSED to all but me \r\nbecomes a chilling, deeply disturbing poem when we see its effect on the \r\nchildren of whom Frost says, Weep for what little things could make them glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirective by Robert Frost\r\n\r\n\r\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\r\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\r\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\r\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\r\nThere is a house that is no more a house\r\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\r\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\r\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\r\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\r\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry \r\nGreat monolithic knees the former town\r\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\r\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\r\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\r\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\r\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\r\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\r\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\r\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\r\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\r\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\r\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\r\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\r\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\r\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\r\nThey think too much of having shaded out\r\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\r\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\r\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\r\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\r\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\r\nThe height of the adventure is the height\r\nOf country where two village cultures faded\r\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\r\nHere\'s another of my favorite poems on the subject. At we can see, poets are \r\ntackling the problems with Christian theology head-on ...\r\n\r\nThe Worms\' Contempt \r\nby W. H. Davies\r\n\r\nWhat do we earn for all our gentle grace?\r\nA body stiff and cold from foot to face.\r\n\r\nIf you have beauty, what is beauty worth?\r\nA mask to hide it, made of common earth.\r\n\r\nWhat do we get for all our song and prattle?\r\nA gasp for longer breath, and then a rattle.\r\n\r\nWhat do we earn for dreams, and our high teaching?\r\nThe worms\' contempt, that have no time for preaching.\r\n\r\nSome poets more or less abandoned God for nature. None of the great Romantic \r\npoets were orthodox Christians. William Wordsworth seemed to adhere to a \r\nnature-based religion in which the natural piety of childhood was man\'s \r\nsalvation ... \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\nWordsworth seemed to prefer paganism to the tedious, dubious joys of modernism \r\nand orthodoxy ... \r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Is Too Much With Us by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\r\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\r\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\r\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\r\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\r\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\r\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\r\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\r\nIt moves us not.Great God! I\'d rather be\r\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\r\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\r\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\r\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\r\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreath\xe8d horn.\r\n\r\nSome of the most famous Christian hymns were written by poets. Robert Bridges, \r\nan English poet laureate, wrote the English lyrics to the Bach composition \r\nJesu, Joy of Man\'s Desiring. Sir Walter Scott wrote the original English lyric \r\nthat became famous as Ave Maria when Schubert set a German translation to \r\nmusic. The American poet Julia Ward Howe wrote the lyrics for The Battle Hymn \r\nof the Republic. The literary critic George Saintsbury deemed Rock of Ages a \r\ngreat poem. It was written by a published poet \r\nwith the unusual name Augustus Montague Toplady. William Cowper, one of the \r\nleading poets of his day, collaborated with John Newton on a number of hymns; \r\none of those hymns, Amazing Grace, has become the \r\nmost popular Christian hymn. Christina Rossetti was one of the foremost female \r\nEnglish poets of all time, if not the foremost; she \r\nwrote hymns and four books of devotions. The poet Christopher Smart published \r\nfour books of hymns, including one of the first collections of hymns for \r\nchildren. Charles Wesley, perhaps the most famous and prolific hymnist, was a \r\npoet and the son of a poet.He wrote what he called sacred poems along with \r\nnursery rhymes, light verse, satires, elegies and political, occasional and \r\npersonal verses. William Blake\'s poem Jerusalem (of Chariots of Fire fame) \r\nwas set to music and became a popular hymn; in fact, it\'s one my mother knows by \r\nheart. When she couldn\'t find Jerusalem in her church\'s hymnal, she wrote it \r\nin by hand on a blank page! A. E Housman wrote a different kind of hymn. Although he was an atheist, at least he didn\'t accuse \r\nJesus Christ of conspiring to send billions of human beings to an eternal hell \r\nfor not believing in his person ... \r\n\r\nIEaster Hymn\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\nHere\'s Blake again, railing against the prudishness of the black-robed priests \r\nof orthodoxy ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden Of Love \r\n  by William Blake\r\n  \r\n    I laid me down upon a bank,\r\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\r\nI heard among the rushes dank\r\nWeeping, weeping.\r\n    \r\nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\r\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\r\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\r\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\r\n    \r\nI went to the Garden of Love,\r\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\r\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\r\nWhere I used to play on the green.\r\n    \r\nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\r\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\r\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\r\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\r\n    \r\nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\r\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\r\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\r\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite writers on the subject penned his poems in medieval Latin, on \r\nthe cusp of the first Inquisition ...\r\n\r\nHis Confession\r\nby the Archpoet\r\n\r\n\r\ncirca 1165; translated from the original Medieval Latin\r\nby Helen Waddell\r\n\r\n\r\nSeething over inwardly\r\nWith fierce indignation,\r\nIn my bitterness of soul,\r\nHear my declaration.\r\nI am of one element,\r\nLevity my matter,\r\nLike enough a withered leaf\r\nFor the winds to scatter.\r\n\r\nSince it is the property \r\nOf the sapient \r\nTo sit firm upon a rock, \r\nit is evident \r\nThat I am a fool, since I \r\nAm a flowing river, \r\nNever under the same sky, \r\nTransient for ever.\r\n\r\nHither, thither, masterless\r\nShip upon the sea,\r\nWandering through the ways of air,\r\nGo the birds like me.\r\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\r\nPrisoner to no key,\r\nQuesting go I for my kind,\r\nFind depravity. \r\n\r\nNever yet could I endure\r\nSoberness and sadness,\r\nJests I love and sweeter than\r\nHoney find I gladness. \r\nWhatsoever Venus bids\r\nIs a joy excelling,\r\nNever in an evil heart\r\nDid she make her dwelling.\r\n\r\nDown the broad way do I go, \r\nYoung and unregretting, \r\nWrap me in my vices up, \r\nVirtue all forgetting, \r\nGreedier for all delight \r\nThan heaven to enter in: \r\nSince the soul is in me dead, \r\nBetter save the skin.\r\n\r\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\r\nMaster of discretion,\r\nBut this death I die is sweet,\r\nMost delicious poison. \r\nWounded to the quick am I\r\nBy a young girl\'s beauty: \r\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\r\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\r\n\r\nHard beyond all hardness, this\r\nMastering of Nature:\r\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\r\nNear so fair a creature?\r\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\r\nHow should we obey it?\r\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\r\nShall they have no say int?\r\n\r\nSit you down amid the fire,\r\nWill the fire not burn you?\r\nTo Pavia come, will you\r\nJust as chaste return you?\r\nPavia, where Beauty draws\r\nYouth with finger-tips,\r\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\r\nRavished with her lips.\r\n\r\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\r\nIn Pavia dine him,\r\nNever more Hippolytus\r\nWill the morning find him.\r\nIn Pavia not a road\r\nBut leads to venery\r\nNor among its crowding towers\r\nOne to chastity.\r\n\r\nYet a second charge they bring:\r\nI\'m forever gaming.\r\nYea, the dice hath many a time\r\nStripped me to my shaming.\r\nWhat an\' if the body\'s cold,\r\nIf the mind is burning,\r\nOn the anvil hammering,\r\nRhymes and verses turning?\r\n\r\nLook again upon your list. \r\nIs the tavern on it? \r\nYea, and never have I scorned,\r\nNever shall I scorn it,\r\nTill the holy angels come,\r\nAnd my eyes discern them, \r\nSinging for the dying soul, \r\nRequiem aeternam.\r\n\r\nFor on this my heart is set: \r\nWhen the hour is nigh me, \r\nLet me in the tavern die, \r\nWith a tankard by me, \r\nWhile the angels looking down \r\nJoyously sing o\'er me, \r\nDeus sit propitius \r\nHuic potatori.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\r\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\r\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\r\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\r\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\r\nIn a tavern tankard\r\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\r\nBishop has decanted.\r\n\r\nLet them fast and water drink,\r\nAll the poets\' chorus,\r\nFly the market and the crowd\r\nRacketing uproarious.\r\nSit in quiet spots and think,\r\nShun the tavern\'s portal\r\nWrite, and never having lived,\r\nDie to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNever hath the spirit of\r\nPoetry descended,\r\nTill with food and drink my lean\r\nBelly was distended,\r\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\r\nMy cerebral story,\r\nComes Apollo with a rush,\r\nFills me with his glory.\r\n\r\nUnto every man his gift.\r\nMine was not for fasting.\r\nNever could I find a rhyme\r\nWith my stomach wasting.\r\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\r\n\'Tis a better chorus\r\nWhen the landlord hath a good \r\nVintage set before us.\r\n\r\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\r\nI myself betray me,\r\nAnd affirm myself to be\r\nAll my fellows say me.\r\nSee, they in thy presence are:\r\nLet whoeer hath known\r\nHis own heart and found it clean,\r\nCast at me the stone. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it was Jesus Christ himself who instructed men not to cast the first \r\nstone. Christian homophobes seem intent not to take him at his word. Sometimes \r\neven the most devout of devotional poets seem to find little solace in religion \r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nSong \r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nOther poets seem to have adopted a religion based on human love, in which God \r\nplays little or no role ...\r\n\r\nThe Broken Tower\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\r\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\r\nOf a spent day  to wander the cathedral lawn\r\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\r\n\r\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\r\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\r\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\r\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\r\n\r\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\r\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping \r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hope  cleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)  or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)  but slip\r\nOf pebbles,  visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\nLeonard Cohen merges biblical themes (David and Bathsheba, Samson and Delilah) \r\nwith the gospel of human love (sexuality) ... \r\n\r\nHallelujah\r\nby Leonard Cohen\r\n\r\nNow I\'ve heard there was a secret chord\r\nThat David played, and it pleased the Lord\r\nBut you don\'t really care for music, do ya?\r\n\r\nIt goes like this: the fourth, the fifth\r\nThe minor fall, the major lift,\r\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah\r\n\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\n\r\nYour faith was strong but you needed proof\r\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\r\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\r\n\r\nShe tied you to a kitchen chair\r\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair\r\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\r\n\r\nWell, baby I\'ve been here before\r\nI know this room, I\'ve walked this floor\r\nI used to live alone before I knew ya\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen your flag on the marble arch\r\nOur love is not a victory march\r\nIt\'s a cold and it\'s a broken Hallelujah\r\n\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\n\r\nThere was a time you let me know\r\nWhat\'s really going on below\r\nBut now you never show it to me, do ya?\r\n\r\nAnd remember when I moved in you\r\nThe holy dove was moving too\r\nAnd every breath we drew was Hallelujah\r\n\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\n\r\nYou say I took the name in vain\r\nI don\'t even know the name\r\nBut if I did, well really, what\'s it to ya?\r\n\r\nThere\'s a blaze of light in every word\r\nIt doesn\'t matter which you heard\r\nThe holy or the broken Hallelujah\r\n\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\n\r\nI did my best, it wasn\'t much\r\nI couldn\'t feel, so I tried to touch\r\nI\'ve told the truth, I didn\'t come to fool ya\r\n\r\nAnd even though it all went wrong\r\nI\'ll stand before the Lord of Song\r\nWith nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah\r\n\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\r\nHallelujah\r\n\r\nOther poets seem to say or intimate that human beings and/or nature are divine, \r\nas in this poem by William Wordsworth to his beloved sister ... \r\n\r\n\r\nIt Is A Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free \r\n\r\nby William\r\nWordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a beauteous evening, calm and free,\r\nThe holy time is quiet as a Nun\r\nBreathless with adoration; the broad sun\r\nIs sinking down in its tranquillity;\r\nThe gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the Sea:\r\nListen! the mighty Being is awake,\r\nAnd doth with his eternal motion make\r\nA sound like thundereverlastingly.\r\nDear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,\r\nIf thou appear untouched by solemn thought,\r\nThy nature is not therefore less divine:\r\nThou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year;\r\nAnd worship\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine,\r\nGod being with thee when we know it not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n But other poets are more skeptical about human nature. Percy Bysshe \r\nShelley, another of the great Romantic poets, was an atheist ... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n by Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\nSometimes faith and worldliness combine in the same poet. John Donne wrote some \r\nof the most famous sermons and devotional poems of all time. But he was also a \r\nladies\' man and a sensualist ... \r\n\r\n\r\nSong \r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devil\'s foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s interesting (at least to me) that even among the best-known devotional \r\npoets, the most famous poems are seldom about Jesus, the atonement, etc. Here\'s \r\na wonderful example:\r\nThe Windhover by Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a poem in which I cast doubt on the idea that heterosexuals will be \r\nsaved by grace while homosexuals go to an eternal hell ... \r\n\r\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insert\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor the Religious Right\r\n\r\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insertand Hell is for Queers on the back of my shirt.\r\n And I uphold the Law,\r\n for Grace has a Flaw:\r\nthe Church must have someone to drag through the dirt. \r\nIve got ten thousand reasons why Hell must exist,\r\nand youre at the top of my fast-swelling list!\r\n Youre nothing like me,\r\n so God must agree\r\nand slam down the Hammer with His Loving Fist!\r\nFor what are the chances that God has a plan\r\nto save everyone: even Boy George and Wham!?\r\n Eternal fell torture\r\n in Hells pressure scorcher\r\nwill separate homo from Man.\r\nIm glad Im redeemed, ecstatic youre not.\r\nDid Christ die for sinners? Perish the thought!\r\n The good news is this:\r\n soon my Vengeance is His!,\r\nfor youre not the lost sheep He sought.\r\n\r\nThis is a poem I wrote for Tom Merrill, who is really \r\nin trouble according to conservative Christians, since he\'s an atheist and gay \r\n...Lean Harvests\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nfor T.M. \r\nthe trees are shedding their leaves again:\r\nanother summer is over.\r\nthe Christians are praising their Maker again,\r\nbut not the disconsolate plover:\r\n i hear him berate\r\n the fate \r\n of his mate;\r\nhe claims God is no bodys lover. \r\nWilfred Owen, probably the greatest anti-war poet in the history of the English \r\nlanguage, spoke strongly against the horrors of armaments and war and seemed to \r\nsubscribe to a Greek rather than Christian view of the afterlife ...\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nEven poets who rarely if ever wrote on religious themes seem to have been \r\ninfluenced by the Bible. A case in point is this allusion to the fig leaves of \r\nAdam and Eve ... \r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson was another poet who often wrote on religious themes without \r\nsuccumbing to orthodoxy. It\'s hard to say exactly what she believed. The best \r\npoets are seldom icons of religious certitude ...\r\n\r\nHope Is A Thing With Feathers by Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nHope is a thing with feathers\r\nThat perches in the soul\r\nAnd sings a tune without words\r\nAnd never stops at all.\r\n\r\nAnd sweetest, in the gale, is heard\r\nAnd sore must be the storm\r\nThat could abash the little bird\r\nThat keeps so many warm.\r\n\r\nIve heard it in the chilliest land\r\nAnd on the strangest sea\r\nYet, never, in extremity\r\nIt ask a crumb of me.\r\n\r\nPoets like Thomas Hardy seem capable of only a tenuous hope, at best ... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\nOther poets, Walt Whitman for example, can seem more hopeful ... \r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning My Studies \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\'d me so much,\r\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\r\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\r\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\'d me so much,\r\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\'d to go any farther,\r\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\r\n\r\nBut for some poets it seems the sea of faith has dried up more or less \r\ncompletely ... \r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson is one of my favorite unknown or under-known poets ... \r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long\r\n    duration Horace\r\n    \r\n    They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\n    Love and desire and hate:\r\n    I think they have no portion in us after\r\n    We pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\n    Out of a misty dream\r\n    Our path emerges for a while, then closes\r\n    Within a dream.\r\n\r\nUnlike the priests, parsons and preachers of religious orthodoxy, the best poets \r\nseem to prefer brutal honesty to glossing over the facts ...\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n      Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\n    The day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\n    And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\n    Despair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\n    Broods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\n    Laughter or tears, for we have only known\r\n    Surpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\n    Have driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\n    Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\n    To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\n    Find end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\n    Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\n    Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\n    Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\nAnd poets, like Jesus, often seem to prefer the company of prostitutes to that \r\nof Pharisees ...\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\n      Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n    \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n    \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nBut then the wisest man in the Bible was a sensualist and a nonbeliever ...\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of Solomon\r\nattributed to King Solomon\r\n\r\nI am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\nAs the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\nAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.\r\nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\nHe brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.\r\nStay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.\r\nHis left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.\r\nI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,\r\nand by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.\r\n\r\nThe voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.\r\nMy beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall,\r\nhe looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.\r\nMy beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.\r\nFor, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;\r\nThe flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,\r\nand the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;\r\nThe fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell.\r\nArise, my love, my fair one, and come away.\r\n\r\nO my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance,\r\nlet me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\r\nTake us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.\r\n\r\nMy beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.\r\nUntil the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,\r\nand be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.\r\n\r\nThe better poets tend to tell it like it is, especially when suffering and \r\ndeath are concerned. Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman are the first truly great, \r\ntruly original American poets. It\'s interesting that neither one of them seemed \r\nto be an orthodox Christian, although they both wrote a good number of highly \r\nspiritual poems ... \r\n\r\nThe Bustle In A House \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThe bustle in a house\r\nThe morning after death\r\nIs solemnest of industries\r\nEnacted upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping up the heart\r\nAnd putting love away\r\nWe shall not want to use again\r\nUntil eternity.\r\n\r\nIf death is the end of everything, is there any reason to be sentimental about \r\nit? ... \r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April \r\n Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, \r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted, \r\n I shall not care. \r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful \r\n When rain bends down the bough; \r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted \r\n Than you are now.\r\n\r\nFor some poets, Time and Death seem to be the only gods ... \r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nEven the greatest of all Christian apologists, C. S. Lewis, can make religion \r\nseem inadequate in the face of Time, Death and Decay ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Ruin Falls \r\nby C. S. Lewis\r\n\r\nAll this is flashy rhetoric about loving you \r\nI never had a selfless thought since I was born.\r\nI am mercenary and self-seeking through and through;\r\nI want God, you, all friends merely to serve my turn.\r\n\r\nPeace, re-assurance, pleasure are the goals I seek;\r\nI cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin;\r\nI talk of love  a scholar\'s parrot may talk Greek,\r\nBut self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.\r\n\r\nOnly that you now have taught me (but how late!) my lack,\r\nI see the chasm; and everything you are was making\r\nMy heart into a bridge by which I might get back\r\nFrom exile and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.\r\nFor this I bless you as the ruin falls. The pains\r\nYou give me are more precious than all other gains.\r\n\r\nEven the most spiritual of poets can make the love and wisdom of God seem \r\ninadequate to the task. What sort of god allows angels to be crushed? ... \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Sweet, Crushed Angel \r\nby Hafiz, as translated by Daniel Ladinsky\r\n\r\n You have not danced so badly, my dear,\r\nTrying to hold hands with the Beautiful One.\r\n\r\nYou have waltzed with great style,\r\nMy sweet, crushed angel,\r\nTo have ever neared God\'s heart at all.\r\n\r\nOur Partner is notoriously difficult to follow,\r\nAnd even His best musicians are not always easy\r\n To hear.\r\n\r\nSo what if the music has stopped for a while.\r\n\r\n So what\r\nIf the price of admission to the Divine\r\n Is out of reach tonight.\r\n\r\n So what, my dear,\r\nIf you do not have the ante to gamble for Real Love.\r\n\r\n The mind and the body are famous\r\n For holding the heart ransom,\r\n\r\nBut Hafiz knows the Beloved\'s eternal habits.\r\n\r\n Have patience,\r\n\r\nFor He will not be able to resist your longing\r\n For Long.\r\n\r\nYou have not danced so badly, my dear,\r\n Trying to kiss the Beautiful One.\r\n\r\nYou have actually waltzed with tremendous style,\r\n O my sweet,\r\n O my sweet crushed angel.\r\n\r\nBut even though poets tend to be impractical creatures, they do seem to find \r\nreasons to continue living, for the most part, despite the long odds against \r\nthem ... \r\n\r\nRequiem \r\nby Robert L. Stevenson\r\n\r\nUnder the wide and starry sky\r\nDig the grave and let me lie.\r\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\r\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\r\n\r\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\r\nHere he lies where he longed to be,\r\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\r\nAnd the hunter home from the hill.\r\n\r\nByron, another of the great Romantics, was a poet who seemed to flit between \r\natheism and Calvinism ... \r\n\r\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving \r\nby George Gordon, Lord \r\nByron\r\n\r\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n So late into the night,\r\nThough the heart be still as loving,\r\n And the moon be still as bright.\r\n\r\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\r\n And the soul outwears the breast,\r\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\r\n And love itself have rest.\r\n\r\nThough the night was made for loving,\r\n And the day returns too soon,\r\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n By the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nWhat Shakespeare believed, or didn\'t believe, no one seems to know ...\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five \r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nThe eternal themes of Time and Death are common to both Western and Eastern \r\npoetry ...\r\n\r\nThe Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\r\n\r\nAwake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night\r\nHas flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:\r\n And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught\r\nThe Sultan\'s Turret in a Noose of Light.\r\n\r\nDreaming when Dawn\'s Left Hand was in the Sky\r\nI heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,\r\n Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup\r\nBefore Life\'s Liquor in its Cup be dry.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the Cock crew, those who stood before\r\nThe Tavern shouted  Open then the Door!\r\n  You know how little while we have to stay,\r\nAnd, once departed, may return no more.\r\n\r\nNow the New Year reviving old Desires,\r\nThe thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,\r\n Where the White Hand of Moses on the Bough\r\nPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.\r\n\r\nIram indeed is gone with all its Rose,\r\nAnd Jamshyd\'s Sev\'n-ring\'d Cup where no one knows;\r\n But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields,\r\nAnd still a Garden by the Water blows.\r\n\r\nAnd David\'s Lips are lock\'t; but in divine\r\nHigh piping Pehlevi, with Wine! Wine! Wine!\r\n  Red Wine!  the Nightingale cries to the Rose\r\nThat yellow Cheek of hers t\'incarnadine.\r\n\r\nCome, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring\r\nThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:\r\n The Bird of Time has but a little way\r\nTo fly  and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.\r\n\r\n... \r\n\r\nOh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the Wise\r\nTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;\r\n One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;\r\nThe Flower that once has blown forever dies.\r\n\r\nMyself when young did eagerly frequent\r\nDoctor and Saint, and heard great Argument\r\n About it and about; but evermore\r\nCame out by the same Door as in I went.\r\n\r\nWith them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,\r\nAnd with my own hand labour\'d it to grow:\r\n And this was all the Harvest that I reap\'d \r\n\'I came like Water and like Wind I go.\'\r\n\r\nBut sometimes in the midst of sounding as if there can be no hope, poets seem to \r\ncontradict themselves ... \r\n\r\nCredo\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nI cannot find my way: there is no star\r\nIn all the shrouded heavens anywhere;\r\nAnd there is not a whisper in the air\r\nOf any living voice but one so far\r\nThat I can hear it only as a bar\r\nOf lost, imperial music, played when fair\r\nAnd angel fingers wove, and unaware,\r\nDead leaves to garlands where no roses are.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a glimmer, nor a call,\r\nFor one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears,\r\nThe black and awful chaos of the night;\r\nFor through it allabove, beyond it all\r\nI know the far sent message of the years,\r\nI feel the coming glory of the light.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there seems to be no consensus among the poets. Shakespeare\'s faith \r\nremains enigmatic, if not entirely invisible. Shelley, Housman and Merrill are \r\nself-avowed atheists. Blake spoke to angels on a daily basis, but despised the \r\nblack-robed priests of religious orthodoxy who called free love a sin. Milton \r\npurported to justify the ways of God to man, but somehow managed to turn Satan \r\ninto a hero for the ages. Whitman was a mystic who seemed to find God in himself \r\nand all creation, even blades of grass. Many poets seem to believe in Love, but \r\nnot in god. And so it goes.\r\n\r\nSome of the best Christian poets were Universalists. They believed everyone \r\nwould make it to heaven in the end. Poets who seemed to adhere to some form of \r\nUniversalism include Donne, Samuel Johnson, George Crabbe, Tennyson, Emily \r\nBronte, Anne Bronte, Charlotte Bronte, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett \r\nBrowning, Robert Burns, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Walt Whitman, Alexander Pope, \r\nWilliam Wordsworth, George McDonald, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth \r\nLongfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Lewis Carroll, Matthew Arnold, Victor Hugo \r\nand Christina Rossetti ...\r\n\r\nI believe we can safely make the statement that, just as none of the best-known \r\nAmerican founding fathers were orthodox Christians, so too none of the \r\nbest-known and most-admired Christian poets were orthodox Christians! If we read \r\nKing Solomon closely, he was a sensualist, a hedonist and an agnostic. William \r\nShakespeare also appears to have been an agnostic, and a rationalist. John Donne \r\nwas a sensualist and a hedonist. Saint Paul was a universalist, as were T. S. \r\nEliot, Tennyson, Conrad Aiken, e. e. cummings, Charles Dickens, Thomas \r\nJefferson, George McDonald, Herman Melville, Pete Seeger and William Carlos \r\nWilliams. Emily Dickinson was a freethinker. Dante claimed to have been saved by \r\na pagan poet, Virgil, and his lover Beatrice. John Milton gave the atonement a \r\nsingle embarrassed enjambed line in his epic poem Paradise Lost. A. E. Housman \r\nwas an atheist. Walt Whitman, William Blake, Hafiz and Rumi claimed to be \r\nChrists themselves, not to be saved by Jesus Christ. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote \r\na tract on the necessity of atheism that got him expelled from college. The \r\nHebrew prophets were universalists who never mentioned any possibility of hell \r\nor suffering after death. C. S. Lewis, the great Christian apologist, in his \r\nlast and greatest book Till We Have Faces revealed himself as a \r\nGnostic. Charles Baudelaire, Artur Rimbaud and Hart Crane were also Gnostics, as \r\nwas the author of the Gospel of John. Emerson, Thoreau and Rilke were \r\ntranscendentalists. Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were deists. Robert Frost \r\nwas a skeptic. John Lennon wrote Imagine, a song about abandoning religion \r\nentirely. Where is there a single orthodox Christian among the great poets? \r\n\r\nOther Religious/Spiritual/Christian/Anti-Christian Poems\r\n\r\nThis Be The Verse by Philip Larkin\r\nThe Whitsun Weddings by Philip Larkin\r\nChurchgoing by Philip Larkin\r\nResume \r\nby Dorothy Parker\r\nBathsheba\'s Song \r\nby George Peele\r\n\r\nRelated pages: Best Easter Poems, \r\nDonald Trump: 666 Mark of the Beast\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
