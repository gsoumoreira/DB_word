b'\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  The Best Rondels and Roundels of All Time with Definitions, Examples and a Brief History\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels of All Time\r\nDefinitions, Examples, Timeline and History\r\n\r\nThe roundel is a fairly recent English poetic form created by the Romantic poet Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne (1837-1909). The English roundel is based on the French \r\nrondeau.\r\n\r\nThe English rondel is a much older poetic form, also based on the French \r\nrondeau, which dates back to the 14th century\r\nand medieval poets like Geoffrey Chaucer and Charles d\'Orleans.\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDefinitions and Examples: The French terms rondeau, rondeaux \r\nand rondelet and the English terms rondel, roundel and roundelay are all related to the \r\nMiddle English and Anglo-French root word rund or reund, \r\nmeaning round or rotund. Something that is round circles back \r\non itself. Song that are sung in rounds often repeat multiple refrains. Refrains \r\nare the most distinctive \r\nfeature of the poetic forms in question. Because there are multiple variations of each \r\nnamed poetic form, it may be \r\nhelpful to generalize and say that a rondel/roundel/roundelay is a short rhyming poem with \r\na refrain, as in this lovely example \r\nand exemplar:\r\n\r\nRondel\r\nby Kevin N. Roberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet, [A]\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the phrase Our time has passed begins the \r\nfirst line of the poem and is \r\nrepeated at the end of each stanza. In this poem and the ones below, I have used \r\nitalics to identify the refrain. I have also used the line-end tag [A] for the \r\nfirst refrain, [B] for the second, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Geoffrey Chaucer\'s most beautiful lyric poem is this rondel:\r\nMerciles Beaute \r\n(Merciless Beauty)\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343-1400)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen. \r\nUnless your words heal me hastily,\r\nmy heart\'s wound will remain green;\r\nfor your eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain. \r\nBy all truth, I tell you faithfully\r\nthat you are of life and death my queen;\r\nfor at my death this truth shall be seen:\r\nyour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen.\r\n\r\nRondel: Your Smiling Mouth\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains,\r\nYour hands so smooth, each finger straight and plain,\r\nYour little feetplease, what more can I say?\r\n\r\nIt is my fetish when youre far away\r\nTo muse on these and thus to soothe my pain\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains.\r\n\r\nSo would I beg you, if I only may,\r\nTo see such sights as I before have seen,\r\nBecause my fetish pleases me. Obscene?\r\nIll be obsessed until my dying day\r\nBy your sweet smiling mouth and eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains!\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nof wind and cold and chilling rain\r\nto dress in embroidered light again:\r\nthe light of daybright, festive, gay!\r\nEach bird and beast, without delay,\r\nin its own tongue, sings this refrain:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away!\r\nBrooks, fountains, rivers, streams at play,\r\nwear, with their summer livery,\r\nbright beads of silver jewelry.\r\nAll the Earth has a new and fresh display:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away! \r\nNote: This rondeau was set to music by Debussy in his Trois chansons de \r\nFrance. \r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nby Charles dOrleans (1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nof wind, chill rain and bitter air,\r\nand now goes clad in clothes of gold\r\nof smiling suns and seasons fair,\r\nwhile birds and beasts of wood and fold\r\nnow with each cry and song declare:\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold!\r\nAll brooks, springs, rivers, seaward rolled,\r\nnow pleasant summer livery wear\r\nwith silver beads embroidered where\r\nthe world puts off its raiment old.\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold.\r\n\r\nA Brief History of the Rondel\r\n\r\nThe rondeau derived from two main sources: the rondel, a short  \r\npoem with repeating lines; and the rondeaux, courtly songs that, with their catchy \r\nand memorable rentrement \r\n(refrains), were like pop hits in 14th and 15th century France. \r\n\r\nThe English rondel is a verse form that originated from French lyrical poetry. It is a \r\nvariation of the rondeau typically consisting of two quatrains followed \r\nby a quintet (13 lines total) or a sestet (14 lines total). In some versions of \r\nthe rondel, there is only one repeating line. In other versions, there are two \r\nor more repeated lines or phrases. \r\n\r\nThere is a more detailed Timeline at the bottom of this page. \r\n\r\nHere are three early examples. The first example shows how the repetition of \r\nrefrains was being developed before the later forms appeared.\r\n\r\nUntitled\r\nby an anonymous poet, probably female (12th century) \r\nI walk in loneliness through the greenwood [A]\r\nfor I have none to go with me. \r\n[B]\r\nSince I have lost my friend by not being good\r\nI walk in loneliness through the greenwood. [A]\r\nI\x92ll send him word and make it understood\r\nthat I will be good company.\r\nI walk in loneliness through the greenwood [A]\r\nfor I have none to go with me. \r\n[B]\r\nRondel\r\nCharles d\'Orleans (1391-1465) \r\nStrengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart, [A]\r\nAnd with some store of pleasure give me aid, [B]\r\nFor jealousy, with all them of his part,\r\nStrong siege about the weary tower has laid.\r\nNay, if to break his bands thou art afraid,\r\nToo weak to make his cruel force depart,\r\nStrengthen at least this castle of my heart, \r\n[A]\r\nAnd with some store of pleasure give me aid. [B]\r\nNay, let not jealousy, for all his art\r\nBe master, and the tower in ruin laid,\r\nThat still, ah, Love, thy gracious rule obeyed.\r\nAdvance, and give me succor of my part;\r\nStrengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart. [A]\r\n\r\nAlgernon Charles\r\nSwinburne published a book, A Century of Roundels, which he dedicated to his \r\nfriend the poet Christina Rossetti, who then started writing similar poems \r\nherself, as evidenced by the following examples from her poetry: \x93Wife to \r\nHusband,\x94 \x93A Better Resurrection,\x94 \x93A Life\'s Parallels,\x94 \x93Today For Me,\x94 \x93It Is \r\nFinished\x94 and \x93From Metastasio.\x94 \r\nSwinburne\'s roundel form consists of nine lines each having the same number \r\nof syllables, plus a refrain after the third line and after the last line. The \r\nrefrain must be identical with the beginning of the first line: it may be a \r\nhalf-line, and rhymes with the second line. Swinburne\x92s first roundel was called The \r\nRoundel: \r\n\r\nThe Roundel\r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\n\r\nA roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere, [A]\r\nWith craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,\r\nThat the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear\r\nA roundel is wrought. \r\n[A]\r\nIts jewel of music is carven of all or of aught\x97\r\nLove, laughter, or mourning\x97remembrance of rapture or fear\x97\r\nThat fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought. \r\nAs a bird\'s quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear \r\nPause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught, \r\nSo moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear, \r\nA roundel is wrought. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nHere is the roundel Swinburne dedicated to his fellow Romantic poet Christian \r\nRossetti:\r\nDedication to Christiana G. Rossetti \r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\n\r\nSongs light as these may sound, though deep and strong [A]\r\nThe heart spake through them, scarce should hope to please\r\nEars tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng\r\nSongs light as these. \r\n[A]\r\nYet grace may set their sometime doubt at ease,\r\nNor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong\r\nThe shrine it serves at and the hope it sees. \r\nFor childlike loves and laughters thence prolong\r\nNotes that bid enter, fearless as the breeze,\r\nEven to the shrine of holiest-hearted song,\r\nSongs light as these. \r\n[A]\r\nThere are several variations of the rondel, and some inconsistencies. For \r\nexample, sometimes only the first line of the poem is repeated at the end; or: \r\nthe second refrain may return at the end of last stanza. Henry Austin Dobson \r\nprovides the following example of a rondel: \r\nLove comes back to his vacant dwelling, [A]\r\nThe old, old Love that we knew of yore!\r\nWe see him stand by the open door,\r\nWith his great eyes sad, and his bosom swelling. \r\nHe makes as though in our arms repelling\r\nHe fain would lie as he lay before;\r\nLove comes back to his vacant dwelling, [A]\r\nThe old, old Love that we knew of yore! \r\nAh! who shall help us from over-spelling\r\nThat sweet, forgotten, forbidden lore?\r\nE\'en as we doubt, in our hearts once more,\r\nWith a rush of tears to our eyelids welling,\r\nLove comes back to his vacant dwelling. [A]\r\nAn modern example is We Wear the Mask by Paul Laurence Dunbar: \r\n\r\nWe Wear the Mask\r\nby Paul Laurence Dunbar\r\nWe wear the mask that grins and lies, [A]\r\nIt hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,\x97\r\nThis debt we pay to human guile;\r\nWith torn and bleeding hearts we smile,\r\nAnd mouth with myriad subtleties. \r\nWhy should the world be over-wise,\r\nIn counting all our tears and sighs?\r\nNay, let them only see us, while\r\nWe wear the mask. \r\n[A]\r\nWe smile, but, O great Christ, our cries\r\nTo thee from tortured souls arise.\r\nWe sing, but oh the clay is vile\r\nBeneath our feet, and long the mile;\r\nBut let the world dream otherwise,\r\nWe wear the mask! \r\n[A]\r\nPerhaps the best-known rondeau is the World War I poem In Flanders \r\nFields by John McCrae: \r\n\r\nIn Flanders \r\nFields\r\nby John McCrae\r\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow [A]\r\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\r\nThat mark our place, and in the sky,\r\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly,\r\nScarce heard amid the guns below. \r\nWe are the dead; short days ago\r\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\r\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\r\nIn Flanders fields. \r\n[A]\r\nTake up our quarrel with the foe!\r\nTo you from failing hands we throw\r\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high!\r\nIf ye break faith with us who die\r\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\r\nIn Flanders fields. \r\n[A]\r\nRondeau redoubl\xe9 \r\n\r\nA more complex form is the rondeau redoubl\xe9. This is also written on two \r\nrhymes, but in five stanzas of four lines each and one of five lines. Each of \r\nthe first four lines (stanza 1) get individually repeated in turn once by \r\nbecoming successively the respective fourth lines of stanzas 2, 3, 4,  5; and \r\nthe first part of the first line is repeated as a short fifth line to conclude \r\nthe sixth stanza. This can be represented as\x97A1,B1,A2,B2\x97b,a,b,A1\x97a,b,a,B1\x97b,a,b,A2\x97a,b,a,B2\x97b,a,b,a,(A1). \r\nThe following example of the form was written from the point of view of one \r\nof the RAF officers carrying the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales to the plane \r\nthat was to carry it to England. \r\nGuard of Honour\r\nby Paul Hansford \r\nThe burden I bear is more heavy than lead. \r\n[A1]\r\nThe physical weight is a thing that I share, \r\n[B1]\r\nbut the loss that I feel will not leave my head. \r\n[A2]\r\nWhy did you have to die? Why is death so unfair? [B2]\r\nI am close to you now. Yes, touching my hair\r\nthe flag with its lions of gold and of red\r\nthat wraps round your coffin. I know you are there.\r\nThe burden I bear is more heavy than lead. \r\n[A1]\r\nMy comrades move with me in slow, solemn tread.\r\nOur eyes are all fixed in an unseeing stare.\r\nOur shoulders support you in your oaken bed.\r\nThe physical weight is a thing that I share. \r\n[B1]\r\nAs I feel the world watching I try not to care.\r\nMy deepest emotions are best left unsaid.\r\nLet others show grief like a garment they wear,\r\nbut the loss that I feel will not leave my head. \r\n[A2]\r\nThe flowers they leave like a carpet are spread,\r\nIn the books of remembrance they have written, Somewhere\r\na star is extinguished because you are dead.\r\nWhy did you have to die? Why is death so unfair? [B2]\r\nThe tears that we weep will soon grow more rare,\r\nthe rawness of grief turn to memory instead.\r\nBut deep in our hearts you will always be there,\r\nand I ask, will I ever be able to shed\r\nthe burden I bear? \r\n[A1]\r\nTwo Preludes\r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\nI. Lohengrin\r\nLove, out of the depth of things, [A]\r\nAs a dewfall felt from above,\r\nFrom the heaven whence only springs\r\nLove, \r\n[A]\r\nLove, heard from the heights thereof,\r\nThe clouds and the watersprings,\r\nDraws close as the clouds remove. \r\nAnd the soul in it speaks and sings,\r\nA swan sweet-souled as a dove,\r\nAn echo that only rings\r\nLove. \r\n[A]\r\nII. Tristran und Isolde\r\nFate, out of the deep sea\'s gloom, [A]\r\nWhen a man\'s heart\'s pride grows great,\r\nAnd nought seems now to foredoom\r\nFate, \r\n[A]\r\nFate, laden with fears in wait,\r\nDraws close through the clouds that loom,\r\nTill the soul see, all too late, \r\nMore dark than a dead world\'s tomb,\r\nMore high than the sheer dawn\'s gate,\r\nMore deep than the wide sea\'s womb,\r\nFate. \r\n[A] \r\nSleeping at Last\r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\n\r\nSleeping at last, the trouble and tumult over, [A]\r\nSleeping at last, the struggle and horror past, \r\nCold and white, out of sight of friend and of lover, \r\nSleeping at last. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nNo more a tired heart downcast or overcast, \r\nNo more pangs that wring or shifting fears that hover, \r\nSleeping at last in a dreamless sleep locked fast.\r\n\r\nFast asleep. Singing birds in their leafy cover \r\nCannot wake her, nor shake her the gusty blast. \r\nUnder the purple thyme and the purple clover \r\nSleeping at last. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nIt Is Too Late\r\nby Kevin N. Roberts\r\n\r\nIt is too late. Though we would reinspire [A]\r\nOur dream, rewake a dead desire,\r\nA dismal sea divides our sighs and smiles;\r\nBetween us now so many months and miles\r\nAnd tears for all things torn away by time,\r\nFor faded flowers grown pale and past their prime.\r\nAnd no sweet words can make sick joys revive,\r\nnomystic kiss keeps loves long dead alive.\r\nWhat mortal hand can stay the hand of fate?\r\nIt is too late. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nThe first line of Christina Rossetti\'s A Better Resurrection ends: no wit, \r\nno words, no tears. These words, which place immediate importance on negative \r\nimagery, allude to the absence of intelligence, language and emotion in her \r\nlife. The three-stanza poem, using the rhyme scheme of ABABCDCD, takes the form \r\nof a comparison of the artist\'s life to fading fall leaves and to a broken bowl \r\nunfit to hold water. The poem is both religious, using an Easter theme, and \r\nlyric, in the sense that it expresses direct intense personal emotion in a \r\nmanner suggestive of song (Merriam Webster). The unifying theme of the poem \r\nrepeats three times in the last line of each stanza with Rossetti\'s cry for \r\nJesus to quicken, rise, and drink of her. She describes her life as wilted, \r\nbarren, perishable, and meaningless; a mere husk compared to a full harvest. The \r\nthemes of emptiness, solitude, death, triumph of fall over spring and the Bible \r\nreference I lift mine eyes all relate to the title of the poem and culminate \r\nin a cry for a different, better kind of resurrection. \r\n\r\nA Better Resurrection\r\nby Christina Georgina Rossetti\r\nI have no wit, no words, no tears;\r\nMy heart within me like a stone\r\nIs numbed too much for hopes or fears.\r\nLook right, look left, I dwell alone;\r\nI lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief\r\nNo everlasting hills I see;\r\nMy life is in the falling leaf:\r\nO Jesus, quicken me. [A]\r\nMy life is like a faded leaf,\r\nMy harvest dwindled to a husk:\r\nTruly my life is void and brief\r\nAnd tedious in the barren dusk;\r\nMy life is like a frozen thing,\r\nNo bud nor greenness can I see:\r\nYet rise it shall\x97the sap of spring;\r\nO Jesus, rise in me. [A]\r\nMy life is like a broken bowl,\r\nA broken bowl that cannot hold\r\nOne drop of water for my soul\r\nOr cordial in the searching cold;\r\nCast in the fire the perished thing;\r\nMelt and remould it, till it be\r\nA royal cup for Him, my King:\r\nO Jesus, drink of me [A]\r\n\r\nA Life\'s Parallels\r\nby\r\nChristina Rossetti \r\nNever on this side of the grave again, \r\n[A]\r\nOn this side of the river, \r\nOn this side of the garner of the grain, \r\nNever,\x97 \r\n[A]\r\nEver while time flows on and on and on, [A]\r\nThat narrow noiseless river, \r\nEver while corn bows heavy-headed, wan, \r\nEver\x97 \r\n[A]\r\nNever despairing, often fainting, rueing, [A]\r\nBut looking back, ah never! \r\nFaint yet pursuing, faint yet still pursuing, \r\nEver. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nFirst Footsteps\r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\nA little way, more soft and sweet [A]\r\nThan fields a-flower with May,\r\nA babe\'s feet, venturing, scarce complete\r\nA little way. \r\n[A] \r\nEyes full of dawning day\r\nLook up for mother\'s eyes to meet,\r\nToo blithe for song to say. \r\nGlad as the golden spring to greet\r\nIts first live leaflet\'s play,\r\nLove, laughing, leads the little feet\r\nA little way. \r\n[A]\r\n\r\nRondeaux are French lyric poems coming from the same fourteenth and fifteenth \r\ncentury formal tradition as the earlier rondel and triolet\x97in fact, the three \r\nforms are sometimes considered variations of the same genre. This genre of \r\nfixed-form poetry is powered by strict repetition, both through its reliance on \r\nonly a two-word pattern of rhyme and through its use of the rentrement\x97the \r\nreentry of the poem\'s opening words\x97as a refrain.\r\nThe rondeau first developed as a form of medieval courtly music. One of the \r\nearliest writer-composers of rondeaux was Guillaume de Machaut. (To hear \r\nMachaut\'s rondeau, Rose, liz, printemps being sung by Lionheart, click here, \r\nor visit http://www.chantboy.com/lionheart/machaut.htm ) \r\nAs song, the form was four stanzas with fully repeating refrains, making use \r\nof much more repetition than the modern literary rondeau or its variants. The \r\nearliest sung rondeaux developed in the thirteenth century and became well known \r\nthrough the compositions of Adam de la Halle, the hunchback poet, who served \r\nas court poet and musician to the Count d\'Artois. \r\nThe rondeau, adopted by church musicians as an emotionally rich container, \r\ncontinued into the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Not only for spiritual \r\nworship, the rondeau was also used for devotion to secular subjects such as \r\nspringtime, courtly love, and romance. Oddly, the form also clearly offered a \r\nvehicle for the celebration of melancholy. Many rondeaux seem to be about pain \r\nand loss; yet they turn by the last stanza to a light, almost jovial statement \r\nof c\'est la vie! (Only the English, who adopted the rondeau at the end of the \r\neighteenth century, truly attempt serious verse with this form\x97according to The \r\nPrinceton Handbook). \r\nThe standard literary rondeau is usually found as fifteen octo- or \r\ndecasyllabic lines divided into three stanzas, a quintet, quatrain and sestet. \r\nThe refrain consists of the first few words of the first line of the first \r\nstanza. The rentrement, or refrain, ends the second and third stanzas, serving \r\nas their last lines. Only two rhymes are used throughout (Turco). The rhyme \r\nscheme is as follows: aabba aabR aabbaR. \r\nAccording to Helen Louise Cohen in her book, Lyric Forms from France, the \r\nrefrains became shorter from the mid-fifteenth century most likely because of \r\nthe scribes\' practice of not writing out the full refrain of one or two lines in \r\nsubsequent stanzas. Eventually, the readers forgot the shortening of the lines \r\nwas an abbreviation. \r\nTo hear some of Guillaume de Machaut\'s work, along with further discussion \r\nand illustration, visit http://www.chantboy.com/lionheart/machaut.htm. \r\nThis practice seems to be illustrated in the following segment of The \r\nTestament by the fifteenth century poet, Fran\xe7ois Vill\xf3n (as translated by \r\nGalway Kinnell):\r\nDeath I appeal your harshness\r\nHaving robbed me of my mistress\r\nYou remain unsatisfied\r\nWaiting for me to languish too\r\nSince then I\'ve had no strength or vigor\r\nBut in her life how did she offend you?\r\nDeath etc. \r\nWe were two, we had but one heart\r\nSince it is dead then I must die\r\nYes or live without life\r\nAs images do, by heart\r\nDeath, etc.\r\n\r\nWith only the first few words of the opening line now used as rentrement, \r\nthis form allowed for new angles of meaning to be possible in the refrain, and \r\ndepending on its context. The evolution of the shortened refrain has continued \r\ninto modern rondeau such as Paul Laurence Dunbar\'s We Wear the Mask and \r\nMarilyn Hacker\'s Rondeau After a Transatlantic Telephone Call. \r\nRondeau After a Transatlantic Telephone Call\r\nby Marilyn Hacker\r\nLove, it was good to talk to you tonight.\r\nYou lather me like summer though. I light\r\nup, sip smoke. Insistent through walls comes\r\nthe downstairs neighbor\x92s double-bass. It thrums\r\nlike toothache. I will shower away the sweat, \r\nsmoke, summer, sound. Slick, soapy, dripping wet,\r\nI scrub the sharp edge off my appetite.\r\nI want: crisp toast, cold wine prickling my gums,\r\nlove. It was good \r\nimagining around your voice, you, late-\r\nawake there. (It isn\x92t midnight yet\r\nhere.) This last glass washes down the crumbs.\r\nI wish that I could lie down in your arms\r\nand, turned toward sleep there (later), say, \x93Goodnight,\r\nlove, It was good.\x94 \r\nRejection\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain.\r\nI\'m guiltless, yet my sentence has been cast.\r\nI tell you truly, needless now to feign,\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain.\r\nAlas, that Nature in your face compassed\r\nSuch beauty, that no man may hope attain\r\nTo mercy, though he perish from the pain;\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain. \r\nEscape\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean.\r\nHe may question me and counter this and that;\r\nI care not: I will answer just as I mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean. \r\nLove strikes me from his roster, short and flat,\r\nAnd he is struck from my books, just as clean,\r\nForevermore; there is no other mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean. \r\n\r\nWhile this poem is not a rondel, in repetition it bears a resemblance to rondels \r\nand villanelles:\r\n\r\nOft in My Thought\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\r\n Around the advent of the fledgling year,\r\nFor something pretty that I really ought\r\n To give my lady dear;\r\n But that sweet thought\'s been wrested from me, clear,\r\n Since death, alas, has sealed her under clay\r\n And robbed the world of all that\'s precious here\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\r\n Acceptable, as suits my age\'s hour?\r\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\r\n Her worth? It tests my power!\r\n I serve her now with masses and with prayer;\r\n For it would be \r\na shame for me to stray\r\n Far from my faith, when my time\'s drawing near\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\r\n And the cost of everything became \r\nso dear;\r\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\r\n Take my good deeds, as many as there are,\r\n And crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\r\n As heaven\'s truest maid! And may I \r\nsay:\r\n Most good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\r\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\r\n Then my heart floods like an overflowing bay\r\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nA Brief Timeline of the Rondel, the Villanelle and Poems, Songs and Speeches with Refrains \r\n\r\n All dates are AD; some are educated guesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n658  \r\nCaedmon\'s Hymn, the \r\noldest dateable English poem, marks the beginning of what came to be known as English \r\npoetry (although it was Anglo-Saxon and thus heavily Germanic)\r\n 990   \r\nWulf and Eadwacer may be the first English poem with a refrain; it may have been written by a \r\nfemale Anglo-Saxon scop, circa 960-990\r\n  1260 \r\n\r\nSumer is icumen in is an early rhyming poem with a refrain, circa \r\n1260; it may be the oldest extant English song as well, with a musical score in \r\nLatin!\r\n  1380  \r\nMerciles Beaute (Merciless Beauty) \r\nis an early poem with a double refrain, a rondel\r\nby the first major English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, circa 1380\r\n 1394  The birth of \r\nCharles D\'Orleans, a master of the \r\nballade, chanson, rondeauand rondel; he would write poetry in both French and \r\nEnglish\r\n 1430 \r\n\r\nI Have a Yong Suster is an anonymous Medieval English riddle-poem \r\nwith repeating lines that has also been described as a \r\npopular song and a folk song\r\n 1503  The birth of \r\nThomas Wyatt; he and Henry Howard introduce \r\nthe sonnet, iambic pentameter and blank verse to England, beginning the\r\nEnglish Renaissance\r\n\r\n\r\n 1504  Corpus Christi Carol has a haunting \r\ndouble refrain: Lully, lullay, lully, lullay!

Before Passerat created his nonce form, there was \r\nno poetic villanelle form to speak of, and villanelles were performed at \r\nchoral dances (think of dancers calling out lines to music at a hoe-down).\r\n\r\n[**]  Wilhelm T\xe9nint appears to be the source of the idea \r\nthat the more exacting form was older and more common than it really was. \r\n\r\n[***]As for the villanelle, M. De Banville declares that it is the fairest \r\njewel in the casket of the muse Erato! However, it seems the form was not \r\nreally ancient, but relatively new and one-of-a-kind. \r\n\r\nBut all\'s well that ends well, and we have some marvelous poems as a result of \r\nall the confusion! \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n \t\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Best Sonnets,\r\nThe Best Villanelles,\r\nThe Best Ballads,\r\nThe Best Sestinas,\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels,\r\nThe Best Kyrielles,\r\nThe Best Couplets,\r\nThe Best Quatrains,\r\nThe Best Haiku,\r\n\r\nThe Best Limericks,\r\nThe Best Nonsense Verse,\r\nThe Best Poems for Kids,\r\nThe Best Light Verse,\r\n\r\nThe Best Poem of All Time,\r\nThe Best Poems Ever Written, \r\nThe Best Poets,\r\nThe Best of the Masters,\r\nThe Most Popular Poems of All Time,\r\nThe Best American Poetry,\r\nThe Best Poetry Translations,\r\nThe Best Ancient Greek Epigrams and Epitaphs,\r\nThe Best Anglo-Saxon Riddles and Kennings,\r\nThe Best Old English Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Lyric Poetry,\r\nThe Best Free Verse, \r\nThe Best Story Poems,\r\nThe Best Narrative Poems,\r\nThe Best Epic Poems,\r\nThe Best Epigrams,\r\n\r\nThe Most Beautiful Poems in the English Language,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Lines in the English Language,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Sonnets in the English Language,\r\n\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments,\r\nThe Best Poems about Death and Loss,\r\nThe Best Holocaust Poetry,\r\nThe Best Hiroshima Poetry,\r\nThe Best Anti-War Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Religious Poetry,\r\nThe Best Spiritual Poetry, \r\nThe Best Heretical Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Thanksgiving Poems,\r\nThe Best Autumnal Poems,\r\nThe Best Fall/Autumn Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Vampire Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Love Poems,\r\nThe Best Urdu Love Poetry, \r\nThe Best Erotic Poems,\r\nThe Best Romantic Poetry,\r\nThe Best Love Songs,\r\n\r\nThe Ten Greatest Poems Ever Written,\r\nThe Greatest Movies of All Time,\r\nEngland\'s Greatest Artists,\r\n\r\nVisions of Beauty,\r\n\r\nWhat is Poetry?,\r\nThe Best Abstract Poetry,\r\nThe Best Antinatalist Poems and Prose,\r\nEarly Poems: The Best Juvenilia,\r\nGeoffrey Chaucer,\r\nCharles d\'Orleans\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
