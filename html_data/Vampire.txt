Elizabeth Bathory, a Hungarian countess, has also been proposed as a \r\nfemale vampire. She has been deemed to be the most prolific female murderer, by \r\nthe Guinness Book of World Records. There are accounts that she bathed in the \r\nblood of her victims in an attempt to remain young. She has been called the \r\nBlood Countess and Countess Dracula. \r\n\r\nHistory:\r\nAccording to Dracula: Sense and Nonsense by Elizabeth Miller, in 1890 the \r\nnovelist Bram Stoker read a book about the bloody lords of Wallachia, part of \r\npresent-day Romania and adjacent to Transylvania. Although the book did not \r\nmention Vlad III by name, Stoker was struck by the word Dracula. He wrote in \r\nhis notes: in Wallachian language means DEVIL. It is therefore possible that \r\nStoker chose to name his character Dracula for the word\'s devilish \r\nassociations.The name Dracula means Son of the Dragon. Vlad III was said \r\nto have dipped his bread in the blood of his victims, so that could be where the \r\nlegend of Wallachian blood drinkers began. \r\n\r\nRelated pages: The Best Vampire Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Morris looking haunted and haunting ...\r\n\r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known\r\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\nTwine our torn hands!

Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nVampires are such fragile creatures;\r\nwe dread the dark, but the light destroys them ...\r\nsunlight, or a stake, or a crosssuch common things.\r\nStill, late at night, when the bat-like vampire sings,\r\nwe shrink from his voice.\r\nCenturies have taught us:\r\nin shadows danger lurks for those who stray,\r\nand there the vampire bares his yellow fangs\r\nand feels the ancient soul-tormenting pangs.\r\nHe has no choice.\r\nWe are his prey, plump and fragrant,\r\nand if we pray to avoid him, the more he prays to find us ...\r\nprays to some despotic hooded God\r\nwhose benediction is the humid blood\r\nhe lusts to taste.\r\n\r\nFragment of a Ballad\r\nby Elizabeth Siddal\r\n\r\n\r\nMany a mile over land and sea\r\nUnsummoned my love returned to me;\r\nI remember not the words he said\r\nBut only the trees moaning overhead.\r\n\r\nAnd he came ready to take and bear\r\nThe cross I had carried for many a year,\r\nBut words came slowly one by one\r\nFrom frozen lips shut still and dumb.\r\n\r\nHow sounded my words so still and slow\r\nTo the great strong heart that loved me so,\r\nWho came to save me from pain and wrong\r\nAnd to comfort me with his love so strong?\r\n\r\nI felt the wind strike chill and cold\r\nAnd vapours rise from the red-brown mould;\r\nI felt the spell that held my breath\r\nBending me down to a living death.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Eleanor Siddal (1829-1862), in addition to having been a poet and artist, may have \r\nbeen the first supermodel. Was she also the the first female vampire? Lizzie \r\nSiddal developed a love for poetry at a young age, after having discovered a \r\nTennyson poem on a scrap of newspaper that had been used to wrap a pat of \r\nbutter; the discovery was an inspiration for her to start writing her own poems. \r\nAround 1849 at age 20, she was employed as an artist\'s model by Walter Howell Deverell and \r\nthrough him was introduced to the other Pre-Raphaelites, including her future \r\nhusband, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Her first modeling job was to sit as Viola for \r\nDeverell\'s Twelfth Night painting. She also posed as Ophelia, painted by Sir \r\nJohn Everett Millais. William Michael Rossetti, her brother-in-law, described her as \r\na most beautiful creature with an air between dignity and sweetness with \r\nsomething that exceeded modest self-respect and partook of disdainful reserve; \r\ntall, finely-formed with a lofty neck and regular yet somewhat uncommon \r\nfeatures, greenish-blue unsparkling eyes, large perfect eyelids, brilliant \r\ncomplexion and a lavish heavy wealth of coppery golden hair. By 1851, she had \r\nbecome the primary model and muse of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and also his star \r\npupil. In 1855, John Ruskin, the leading art critic of the Victorian era, \r\npurchased all her work, declaring it better than her male counterparts\', and \r\nbecame her patron. In 1857, several of her paintings and illustrations appeared \r\nin the Pre-Raphaelite Exhibition at Fitzroy Square, Marylebone, where she was \r\nthe only female artist. Dante and Elizabeth married in \r\n1860. She overdosed on laudanum in 1862, possibly a \r\nsuicide, after having dinner with the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne and her \r\nhusband. Dante, overcome with grief, placed the journal containing the \r\nonly copies of many of his poems in her coffin. Seven years later, in 1869, her \r\ngrave was exhumed so that the poems could be retrieved. Her hair was said to \r\nhave continued to grow after death so that the coffin was filled with her \r\nflowing coppery hair. Although a worm had burrowed through the book so that some \r\nof the poems were difficult to read, it was reported that her body had remained \r\nuncorrupted. It was this report of Elizabeth\'s unblemished undead appearance \r\nthat has been alleged to have inspired Bam Stokera \r\nneighbor of the Rossettisto \r\nconceive of the character of Lucy Westenra for his famous novel Dracula. It has also been \r\nsuggested that Lucy\'s tomb at the fictional Kingstead Cemetery was largely based \r\non Highgate Cemetery where Elizabeth was laid to rest.In any case, Dante \r\ndid published the recovered poems along with his newer ones; \r\nthey were not well received by some critics because of their eroticism, and he \r\nwas haunted by the exhumation for the rest of his life. Ironically, John William Polidori, the writer of the first modern vampire story, The Vampyre, \r\nwas an uncle of the three most famous Rossettis: Dante, William  \r\nand Christina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Siddal as she might have appeared in her grave, with coppery hair \r\nthat continued to grow even after her demise.  \r\n\r\nAt Last\r\nby Elizabeth Siddal\r\n\r\n\r\nO mother, open the window wide\r\nAnd let the daylight in;\r\nThe hills grow darker to my sight\r\nAnd thoughts begin to swim.\r\n\r\nAnd mother dear, take my young son,\r\n(Since I was born of thee)\r\nAnd care for all his little ways\r\nAnd nurse him on thy knee.\r\n\r\nAnd mother, wash my pale pale hands\r\nAnd then bind up my feet;\r\nMy body may no longer rest\r\nOut of its winding sheet.\r\n\r\nAnd mother dear, take a sapling twig\r\nAnd green grass newly mown,\r\nAnd lay them on my empty bed\r\nThat my sorrow be not known.\r\n\r\nAnd mother, find three berries red\r\nAnd pluck them from the stalk,\r\nAnd burn them at the first cockcrow\r\nThat my spirit may not walk.\r\n\r\nAnd mother dear, break a willow wand,\r\nAnd if the sap be even,\r\nThen save it for sweet Roberts sake\r\nAnd hell know my souls in heaven.\r\n\r\nAnd mother, when the big tears fall,\r\n(And fall, God knows, they may)\r\nTell him I died of my great love\r\nAnd my dying heart was gay.\r\n\r\nAnd mother dear, when the sun has set\r\nAnd the pale kirk grass waves,\r\nThen carry me through the dim twilight\r\nAnd hide me among the graves.\r\n\r\nLike Angels, Winged\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLike angelswinged,\r\nshimmering, misunderstood\r\nthey flit beyond our understanding\r\nbeing neither evil, nor good.\r\nThey are as they are ...\r\nand we are their lovers, their prey;\r\nthey seek us out when the moon is full\r\nand dream of us by day.\r\nTheir eyeshypnotic, alluring\r\ntrap ours with their strange appeal\r\ntill like flame-drawn moths we gather ...\r\nto see, to touch, to feel.\r\nHeld in their arms, enchanted,\r\nwe feel their lips, so old!,\r\ntill with their gorging kisses\r\nwe warm them, growing cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Siddal, as painted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nEarly Death\r\nby Elizabeth Siddal\r\n\r\n\r\nOh grieve not with thy bitter tears\r\nThe life that passes fast;\r\nThe gates of heaven will open wide\r\nAnd take me in at last.\r\n\r\nThen sit down meekly at my side\r\nAnd watch my young life flee;\r\nThen solemn peace of holy death\r\nCome quickly unto thee.\r\n\r\nBut true love, seek me in the throng\r\nOf spirits floating past,\r\nAnd I will take thee by the hands\r\nAnd know thee mine at last.\r\n\r\nSolicitation\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nHe comes to me out of the shadows, acknowledging\r\nmy presence with a tip of his hat, always the gentleman,\r\nand his eyes are on mine like a snakes on a birds\r\nquizzical, mesmerizing.\r\nHe cocks his head as though something he heard intrigues him\r\n(although I hear nothing) and he smiles, amusing himself at my expense;\r\nhis words are full of desire and loathing, and while I hear \r\neverything,\r\nhe says nothing I understand.\r\nThe moon shinesmaniacal, queeras he takes my hand whispering\r\nOur time has come ... And so we stroll together creaking docks\r\nwhere the sea sends sickening things\r\nscurrying under rocks and boards.\r\nMoonlight washes his ashen face as he stares unseeing\r\ninto my eyes. \r\nHe sighs, and the sound crawls slithering down my spine;\r\nmy blood seems to pause at his touch as he caresses my face.\r\nHe unfastens my dress till the white lace shows, and my neck is bared.\r\nHis teeth are long, yellow and hard, his face bearded and haggard.\r\nA wolf howls in the distance. There are no wolves in New York. I gasp.\r\nMy blood is a trickle his wet tongue embraces. My heart races madly.\r\nHe likes it like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Siddal, as painted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nGone\r\nby Elizabeth Siddal\r\n\r\n\r\nTo touch the glove upon her tender hand,\r\nTo watch the jewel sparkle in her ring,\r\nLifted my heart into a sudden song\r\nAs when the wild birds sing.\r\n\r\nTo touch her shadow on the sunny grass,\r\nTo break her pathway through the darkened wood,\r\nFilled all my life with trembling and tears\r\nAnd silence where I stood.\r\n\r\nI watch the shadows gather round my heart,\r\nI live to know that she is gone.\r\nGone gone for ever, like the tender dove\r\nThat left the Ark alone.\r\nSometimes the Dead\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nSometimes we catch them out of the corners of our eyes\r\nthe pale dead.\r\nAfter they have fled\r\nthe gourds of their bodies, like escaping fragrances they rise.\r\nOnce they have become a clouds mist, sometimes like the rain\r\nthey descend;\r\nthey appear, sometimes silver like laughter,\r\nto gladden the hearts of men.\r\nSometimes like a pale gray fog, they drift\r\nunencumbered, yet lumbrously,\r\nas if over the sea\r\nthere was the lightest vapor even Atlas could not lift.\r\nSometimes they haunt our dreams like forgotten melodies\r\nonly half-remembered.\r\nThough they lie dismembered\r\nin black catacombs, sepulchers and dismal graves; although they have committed \r\nfelonies,\r\nyet they are us. Someday soon we will meet them in the graveyard dust\r\nblood-engorged, but never sated\r\nsince Cain slew Abel.\r\nBut until we become them, let us steadfastly forget them, even as we know our \r\nchildren must ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Siddal, as painted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nShepherd Turned Sailor\r\nby Elizabeth Siddal\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Christ ye save yon bonny shepherd\r\nSailing on the sea;\r\nTen thousand souls are sailing there\r\nBut they belong to Thee.\r\nIf he is lost then all is lost\r\nAnd all is dead to me.\r\n\r\nMy love should have a grey head-stone\r\nAnd green moss at his feet\r\nAnd clinging grass above his breast\r\nWhereon his lambs could bleat,\r\nAnd I should know the span of earth\r\nWhere some day I might sleep.\r\nStyx\r\nby Michael R.

But even here, they say, \r\nHere where the dull sun shines this afternoon\r\nAs desolate as ever the dead moon\r\nDid glimmer on dead Sardis,  men were gay;\r\nAnd there were little children here to play,\r\nWith small soft hands that once did keep in tune\r\nThe strings that stretch from heaven, till too soon\r\nThe change came, and the music passed away.\r\n\r\nNow there is nothing but the ghosts of things, \r\nNo life, no love, no children, and no men;\r\nAnd over the forgotten place there clings\r\nThe strange and unrememberable light\r\nThat is in dreams. The music failed, and then\r\nGod frowned, and shut the village from His sight.\r\n\r\nThe Lovemaker\r\n\r\nby Robert Mezey\r\n\r\nI see you in her bed,\r\nDark, rootless epicene,\r\nWhere a lone ghost is laid\r\nAnd other ghosts convene;\r\n\r\nAnd hear you moan at last\r\nYour pleasure in the deep\r\nHaven of her who kissed\r\nYour blind mouth into sleep.\r\n\r\nBut body, once enthralled,\r\nWakes in the chains it wore,\r\nDishevelled, stupid, cold,\r\nAnd famished as before,\r\n\r\nAnd hears its paragon\r\nBreathe in the ghostly air,\r\nAnonymous carrion\r\nRavished by despair.\r\n\r\nLovemaker, I have felt\r\nDesire take my part,\r\nBut lacked your constant fault\r\nAnd something of your art,\r\n\r\nAnd would not bend my knees\r\nTo the unmantled pride\r\nThat left you in that place,\r\nForever unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n"I am not as I was under the reign of the good Cynara"Horace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\nHer face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\nWhite Goddess\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas, campaniles with reveilles out leaping \r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hopecleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)but slip\r\nOf pebbles,visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides ... High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\nHaunted Houses\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nAll houses wherein men have lived and died\r\nAre haunted houses. Through the open doors\r\nThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,\r\nWith feet that make no sound upon the floors.\r\n\r\nWe meet them at the door-way, on the stair,\r\nAlong the passages they come and go,\r\nImpalpable impressions on the air,\r\nA sense of something moving to and fro.\r\n\r\nThere are more guests at table than the hosts\r\nInvited; the illuminated hall\r\nIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\r\nAs silent as the pictures on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe stranger at my fireside cannot see\r\nThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;\r\nHe but perceives what is; while unto me\r\nAll that has been is visible and clear.\r\n\r\nWe have no title-deeds to house or lands;\r\nOwners and occupants of earlier dates\r\nFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,\r\nAnd hold in mortmain still their old estates.\r\n\r\nThe spirit-world around this world of sense\r\nFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhere\r\nWafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense\r\nA vital breath of more ethereal air.\r\n\r\nOur little lives are kept in equipoise\r\nBy opposite attractions and desires;\r\nThe struggle of the instinct that enjoys,\r\nAnd the more noble instinct that aspires.\r\n\r\nThese perturbations, this perpetual jar\r\nOf earthly wants and aspirations high,\r\nCome from the influence of an unseen star\r\nAn undiscovered planet in our sky.\r\n\r\nAnd as the moon from some dark gate of cloud\r\nThrows o\'er the sea a floating bridge of light,\r\nAcross whose trembling planks our fancies crowd\r\nInto the realm of mystery and night,\r\n\r\nSo from the world of spirits there descends\r\nA bridge of light, connecting it with this,\r\nO\'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,\r\nWander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\r\nThe Vampire\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nShe rose among us where we lay.\r\nShe wept, we put our work away.\r\nShe chilled our laughter, stilled our play;\r\nAnd spread a silence there.\r\nAnd darkness shot across the sky,\r\nAnd once, and twice, we heard her cry;\r\nAnd saw her lift white hands on high\r\nAnd toss her troubled hair.\r\n\r\nWhat shape was this who came to us,\r\nWith basilisk eyes so ominous,\r\nWith mouth so sweet, so poisonous,\r\nAnd tortured hands so pale?\r\nWe saw her wavering to and fro,\r\nThrough dark and wind we saw her go;\r\nYet what her name was did not know;\r\nAnd felt our spirits fail.\r\n\r\nWe tried to turn away; but still\r\nAbove we heard her sorrow thrill;\r\nAnd those that slept, they dreamed of ill\r\nAnd dreadful things:\r\nOf skies grown red with rending flames\r\nAnd shuddering hills that cracked their frames;\r\nOf twilights foul with wings;\r\n\r\nAnd skeletons dancing to a tune;\r\nAnd cries of children stifled soon;\r\nAnd over all a blood-red moon\r\nA dull and nightmare size.\r\nThey woke, and sought to go their ways,\r\nYet everywhere they met her gaze,\r\nHer fixed and burning eyes.\r\n\r\nWho are you now, we cried to her\r\nSpirit so strange, so sinister?\r\nWe felt dead winds above us stir;\r\nAnd in the darkness heard\r\nA voice fall, singing, cloying sweet,\r\nHeavily dropping, though that heat,\r\nHeavy as honeyed pulses beat,\r\nSlow word by anguished word.\r\n\r\nAnd through the night strange music went\r\nWith voice and cry so darkly blent\r\nWe could not fathom what they meant;\r\nSave only that they seemed\r\nTo thin the blood along our veins,\r\nForetelling vile, delirious pains,\r\nAnd clouds divulging blood-red rains\r\nUpon a hill undreamed.\r\n\r\nAnd this we heard: Who dies for me,\r\nHe shall possess me secretly,\r\nMy terrible beauty he shall see,\r\nAnd slake my body\'s flame.\r\nBut who denies me cursed shall be,\r\nAnd slain, and buried loathsomely,\r\nAnd slimed upon with shame.\r\n\r\nAnd darkness fell. And like a sea\r\nOf stumbling deaths we followed, we\r\nWho dared not stay behind.\r\nThere all night long beneath a cloud\r\nWe rose and fell, we struck and bowed,\r\nWe were the ploughman and the ploughed,\r\nOur eyes were red and blind.\r\n\r\nAnd some, they said, had touched her side,\r\nBefore she fled us there;\r\nAnd some had taken her to bride;\r\nAnd some lain down for her and died;\r\nWho had not touched her hair,\r\nRan to and fro and cursed and cried\r\nAnd sought her everywhere.\r\n\r\nHer eyes have feasted on the dead,\r\nAnd small and shapely is her head,\r\nAnd dark and small her mouth, they said,\r\nAnd beautiful to kiss;\r\nHer mouth is sinister and red\r\nAs blood in moonlight is.\r\n\r\nThen poets forgot their jeweled words\r\nAnd cut the sky with glittering swords;\r\nAnd innocent souls turned carrion birds\r\nTo perch upon the dead.\r\nSweet daisy fields were drenched with death,\r\nThe air became a charnel breath,\r\nPale stones were splashed with red.\r\n\r\nGreen leaves were dappled bright with blood\r\nAnd fruit trees murdered in the bud;\r\nAnd when at length the dawn\r\nCame green as twilight from the east,\r\nAnd all that heaving horror ceased,\r\nSilent was every bird and beast,\r\nAnd that dark voice was gone.\r\n\r\nNo word was there, no song, no bell,\r\nNo furious tongue that dream to tell;\r\nOnly the dead, who rose and fell\r\nAbove the wounded men;\r\nAnd whisperings and wails of pain\r\nBlown slowly from the wounded grain,\r\nBlown slowly from the smoking plain;\r\nAnd silence fallen again.\r\n\r\nUntil at dusk, from God knows where,\r\nBeneath dark birds that filled the air,\r\nLike one who did not hear or care,\r\nUnder a blood-red cloud,\r\nAn aged ploughman came alone\r\nAnd drove his share through flesh and bone,\r\nAnd turned them under to mould and stone;\r\nAll night long he ploughed.\r\n\r\nThe Vampyre\r\nby John Stagg\r\n\r\nWhy looks my lord so deadly pale?\r\nWhy fades the crimson from his cheek?\r\nWhat can my dearest husband ail?\r\nThy heartfelt cares, O Herman, speak!\r\n\r\nWhy, at the silent hour of rest,\r\nDost thou in sleep so sadly mourn?\r\nHas tho\' with heaviest grief oppress\'d,\r\nGriefs too distressful to be borne.\r\n\r\nWhy heaves thy breast?  why throbs thy heart?\r\nO speak!

to thy wife make known\r\nThat grief which preys upon thy heart.\r\n\r\nO Gertrude! how shall I relate\r\nTh\' uncommon anguish that I feel;\r\nStrange as severe is this my fate, \r\nA fate I cannot long conceal.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all my wonted strength,\r\nStern destiny has seal\'d my doom;\r\nThe dreadful malady at length\r\nWil drag me to the silent tomb!\r\n\r\nBut say, my Herman, what\'s the cause\r\nOf this distress, and all thy care.\r\nThat, vulture-like, thy vitals gnaws,\r\nAnd galls thy bosom with despair?\r\n\r\nSure this can be no common grief,\r\nSure this can be no common pain?\r\nSpeak, if this world contain relief,\r\nThat soon thy Gertrude shall obtain.\r\n\r\nO Gertrude, \'tis a horrid cause,\r\nO Gertrude, \'tis unusual care,\r\nThat, vulture-like, my vitals gnaws,\r\nAnd galls my bosom with despair.\r\n\r\nYoung Sigismund, my once dear friend,\r\nBut lately he resign\'d his breath;\r\nWith others I did him attend\r\nUnto the silent house of death.\r\n\r\nFor him I wept, for him I mourn\'d,\r\nPaid all to friendship that was due;\r\nBut sadly friendship is return\'d,\r\nThy Herman he must follow too!\r\n\r\nMust follow to the gloomy grave,\r\nIn spite of human art or skill;\r\nNo pow\'r on earth my life can save,\r\n\'Tis fate\'s unalterable will!\r\n\r\nYoung Sigismund, my once dear friend,\r\nBut now my persecutor foul,\r\nDoth his malevolence extend\r\nE\'en to the torture of my soul.\r\n\r\nBy night, when, wrapt in soundest sleep,\r\nAll mortals share a soft repose,\r\nMy soul doth dreadful vigils keep,\r\nMore keen than which hell scarely knows.\r\n\r\nFrom the drear mansion of the tomb,\r\nFrom the low regions of the dead,\r\nThe ghost of Sigismund doth roam,\r\nAnd dreadful haunts me in my bed!\r\n\r\nThere, vested in infernal guise,\r\n(By means to me not understood,)\r\nClose to my side the goblin lies,\r\nAnd drinks away my vital blood!\r\n\r\nSucks from my veins the streaming life,\r\nAnd drains the fountain of my heart!\r\nO Gertrude, Gertrude! dearest wife!\r\nUnutterable is my smart.\r\n\r\nWhen surfeited, the goblin dire,\r\nWith banqueting by suckled gore,\r\nWill to his sepulchre retire,\r\nTill night invites him forth once more.\r\n\r\nThen will he dreadfully return,\r\nAnd from my veins life\'s juices drain;\r\nWhilst, slumb\'ring, I with anguish mourn,\r\nAnd toss with agonizing pain!\r\n\r\nAlready I\'m exhausted, spent;\r\nHis carnival is nearly o\'er,\r\nMy soul with agony is rent,\r\nTo-morrow I shall be no more!\r\n\r\nBut, O my Gertrude! dearest wife!\r\nThe keenest pangs hath last remain\'d\r\nWhen dead, I too shall seek thy life,\r\nThy blood by Herman shall be drain\'d!\r\n\r\nBut to avoid this horrid fate,\r\nSoon as I\'m dead and laid in earth,\r\nDrive thro\' my corpse a jav\'lin straight; \r\nThis shall prevent my coming forth.\r\n\r\nO watch with me, this last sad night,\r\nWatch in your chamber here alone,\r\nBut carefully conceal the light\r\nUntil you hear my parting groan.\r\n\r\nThen at what time the vesper-bell\r\nOf yonder convent shall be toll\'d,\r\nThat peal shall ring my passing knell,\r\nAnd Herman\'s body shall be cold!\r\n\r\nThen, and just then, thy lamp make bare,\r\nThe starting ray, the bursting light,\r\nShall from my side the goblin scare,\r\nAnd shew him visible to sight!\r\n\r\nThe live-long night poor Gertrude sate,\r\nWatch\'d by her sleeping, dying lord;\r\nThe live-long night she mourn\'d his fate,\r\nThe object whom her soul ador\'d.\r\n\r\nThen at what time the vesper-bell\r\nOf yonder convent sadly toll\'d,\r\nThe, then was peal\'d his passing knell,\r\nThe hapless Herman he was cold!\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Gertrude drew\r\nFrom \'neath her cloak the hidden light;\r\nWhen, dreadful! she beheld in view\r\nThe shade of Sigismund!  sad sight!\r\n\r\nIndignant roll\'d his ireful eyes,\r\nThat gleam\'d with wild horrific stare;\r\nAnd fix\'d a moment with surprise,\r\nBeheld aghast th\' enlight\'ning glare.\r\n\r\nHis jaws cadaverous were besmear\'d\r\nWith clott\'d carnage o\'er and o\'er,\r\nAnd all his horrid whole appear\'d\r\nDistent, and fill\'d with human gore!\r\n\r\nWith hideous scowl the spectre fled;\r\nShe shriek\'d aloud;  then swoon\'d away!\r\nThe hapless Herman in his bed,\r\nAll pale, a lifeless body lay!\r\n\r\nNext day in council \'twas decree,\r\n(Urg\'d at the instance of the state,)\r\nThat shudd\'ring nature should be freed\r\nFrom pests like these ere \'twas too late.\r\n\r\nThe choir then burst the fun\'ral dome\r\nWhere Sigismund was lately laid,\r\nAnd found him, tho\' within the tomb,\r\nStill warm as life, and undecay\'d.\r\n\r\nWith blood his visage was distain\'d,\r\nEnsanguin\'d were his frightful eyes,\r\nEach sign of former life remain\'d,\r\nSave that all motionless he lies.\r\n\r\nThe corpse of Herman they contrive\r\nTo the same sepulchre to take,\r\nAnd thro\' both carcases they drive,\r\nDeep in the earth, a sharpen\'d stake!\r\n\r\nBy this was finish\'d their career,\r\nThro\' this no longer they can roam;\r\nFrom them their friends have nought to fear,\r\nBoth quiet keep the slumb\'ring tomb.\r\n\r\nHere are more great vampire/ghost stories and other eerie, haunting Halloween poems:\r\n\r\nThe Vampire Bride by Henry Thomas Liddell \r\nThe Bride of Corinth by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe \r\nThe Highwayman\r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\nLamia by John Keats\r\nLa Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats\r\n\r\nMariana  by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\nThe Apparition by John Donne\r\nGoblin Market by Christina Rossetti \r\nThe Blessed Damozel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nLilith by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nSudden Light by Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nAllayne by Kevin N.
