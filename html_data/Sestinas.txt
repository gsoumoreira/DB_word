The \nwords that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of \nthe following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.\n\nThe oldest-known sestina is Lo ferm voler qu\'el cor m\'intra, written around \n1200 by Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of Aquitanian origin; he refered to it as \ncledisat, meaning interlock. Daniel is generally considered \nto be the form\'s \ninventor, although it has been suggested that he may have innovated within \na preexisting form. Other early sestinas are Eras, pus vey mon benastruc by \nGuilhem Peire Cazals de Caortz and Ben gran avoleza intra by Bertran \nde Born. These early sestinas were written in Old Occitan (the first Romance \nlanguage and the language of the first troubadours; it evolved from Vulgar Latin \nin the south of France). \n\nThe sestina crossed over into Italian with Dante and Petrarch in the 13th century; by the \n15th century, it was being used in Portuguese by Lu\xeds de Cam\xf5es. The sestina was re-imported \ninto France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet \nto attempt the form in French, and the only one known to have done so prior to the 19th \ncentury.\n\nThe first appearance of the sestina in English print is Ye wastefull woodes, \ncomprising lines 151\x9689 of the August \xc6glogue in Edmund Spenser\'s Shepherd\'s \nCalendar, published in 1579. Although they appeared in print later, Philip \nSidney\'s three sestinas may have been written earlier, and are often credited as \nbeing the first in English. Another early English sestina, \nfound toward the end of Book I of The \nCountess of Pembroke\'s Arcadia, circa 1590, is the double sestina Ye Goatherd Gods. \nAnother early sestina, Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow, is in the most common \nform. Like Ye Goatherd Gods it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and \nuses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian endecasillabo. Farewell, O sun, Arcadia\'s clearest light, is the first rhyming sestina \nin English. William Drummond published two sestinas (which he called sextains) \nin 1616, employing the form of Sidney\'s rhyming sestina. After this, there is an \nabsence of notable sestinas for over 250 years. In \nthe 1870s there was a revival of interest in French forms, led by Andrew Lang, \nAustin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, John Payne, and others. The earliest \nsestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne\'s Sestina. Swinburne \nalso wrote a double \nsestina, The Complaint of Lisa. Starting in the 1930s, another revival of the form \ntook place across the English-speaking world, led by well-known poets such as W. H. Auden, \nElizabeth Bishop and \nEzra Pound.\n\ncompiled \nby Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\nSestina\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nSeptember rain falls on the house.\nIn the failing light, the old grandmother\nsits in the kitchen with the child\nbeside the Little Marvel Stove,\nreading the jokes from the almanac,\nlaughing and talking to hide her tears.\n\nShe thinks that her equinoctial tears\nand the rain that beats on the roof of the house\nwere both foretold by the almanac,\nbut only known to a grandmother.\nThe iron kettle sings on the stove.\nShe cuts some bread and says to the child,\n\nIt\'s time for tea now; but the child\nis watching the teakettle\'s small hard tears\ndance like mad on the hot black stove,\nthe way the rain must dance on the house.\nTidying up, the old grandmother\nhangs up the clever almanac\n\non its string. Birdlike, the almanac\nhovers half open above the child,\nhovers above the old grandmother\nand her teacup full of dark brown tears.\nShe shivers and says she thinks the house\nfeels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.\n\nIt was to be, says the Marvel Stove.\nI know what I know, says the almanac.\nWith crayons the child draws a rigid house\nand a winding pathway. Then the child\nputs in a man with buttons like tears\nand shows it proudly to the grandmother.\n\nBut secretly, while the grandmother\nbusies herself about the stove,\nthe little moons fall down like tears\nfrom between the pages of the almanac\ninto the flower bed the child\nhas carefully placed in the front of the house.\n\nTime to plant tears, says the almanac.\nThe grandmother sings to the marvelous stove\nand the child draws another inscrutable house.\n\n\n\nA Miracle for Breakfast\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nAt six o\x92clock we were waiting for coffee,\nwaiting for coffee and the charitable crumb\nthat was going to be served from a certain balcony\n\x97like kings of old, or like a miracle.\nIt was still dark. One foot of the sun\nsteadied itself on a long ripple in the river.\n\nThe first ferry of the day had just crossed the river.\nIt was so cold we hoped that the coffee\nwould be very hot, seeing that the sun\nwas not going to warm us; and that the crumb\nwould be a loaf each, buttered, by a miracle.\nAt seven a man stepped out on the balcony.\n\nHe stood for a minute alone on the balcony\nlooking over our heads toward the river.\nA servant handed him the makings of a miracle,\nconsisting of one lone cup of coffee\nand one roll, which he proceeded to crumb,\nhis head, so to speak, in the clouds\x97along with the sun.\n\nWas the man crazy? What under the sun\nwas he trying to do, up there on his balcony!\nEach man received one rather hard crumb,\nwhich some flicked scornfully into the river,\nand, in a cup, one drop of the coffee.\nSome of us stood around, waiting for the miracle.\n\nI can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle.\nA beautiful villa stood in the sun\nand from its doors came the smell of hot coffee.\nIn front, a baroque white plaster balcony\nadded by birds, who nest along the river,\n\x97I saw it with one eye close to the crumb\x97\n\nand galleries and marble chambers. My crumb\nmy mansion, made for me by a miracle,\nthrough ages, by insects, birds, and the river\nworking the stone. Every day, in the sun,\nat breakfast time I sit on my balcony\nwith my feet up, and drink gallons of coffee.\n\nWe licked up the crumb and swallowed the coffee.\nA window across the river caught the sun\nas if the miracle were working, on the wrong balcony.\n\n\n\nSestina\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\n\nI saw my soul at rest upon a day\n As a bird sleeping in the nest of night,\nAmong soft leaves that give the starlight way\n To touch its wings but not its eyes with light;\nSo that it knew as one in visions may,\n And knew not as men waking, of delight.\n\nThis was the measure of my soul\'s delight;\n It had no power of joy to fly by day,\nNor part in the large lordship of the light;\n But in a secret moon-beholden way\nHad all its will of dreams and pleasant night,\n And all the love and life that sleepers may.\n\nBut such life\'s triumph as men waking may\n It might not have to feed its faint delight\nBetween the stars by night and sun by day,\n Shut up with green leaves and a little light;\nBecause its way was as a lost star\'s way,\n A world\'s not wholly known of day or night.\n\nAll loves and dreams and sounds and gleams of night\n Made it all music that such minstrels may,\nAnd all they had they gave it of delight;\n But in the full face of the fire of day\nWhat place shall be for any starry light,\n What part of heaven in all the wide sun\'s way?\n\nYet the soul woke not, sleeping by the way,\n Watched as a nursling of the large-eyed night,\nAnd sought no strength nor knowledge of the day,\n Nor closer touch conclusive of delight,\nNor mightier joy nor truer than dreamers may,\n Nor more of song than they, nor more of light.\n\nFor who sleeps once and sees the secret light\n Whereby sleep shows the soul a fairer way\nBetween the rise and rest of day and night,\n Shall care no more to fare as all men may,\nBut be his place of pain or of delight,\n There shall he dwell, beholding night as day.\n\nSong, have thy day and take thy fill of light\n Before the night be fallen across thy way;\nSing while he may, man hath no long delight.\n\n\n\nSestina\nby Dante Alighieri\n\nI have come, alas, to the great circle of shadow,\nto the short day and to the whitening hills,\nwhen the colour is all lost from the grass,\nthough my desire will not lose its green,\nso rooted is it in this hardest stone,\nthat speaks and feels as though it were a woman.\n\nAnd likewise this heaven-born woman\nstays frozen, like the snow in shadow,\nand is unmoved, or moved like a stone,\nby the sweet season that warms all the hills,\nand makes them alter from pure white to green,\nso as to clothe them with the flowers and grass.\n\nWhen her head wears a crown of grass\nshe draws the mind from any other woman,\nbecause she blends her gold hair with the green\nso well that Amor lingers in their shadow,\nhe who fastens me in these low hills,\nmore certainly than lime fastens stone.\n\nHer beauty has more virtue than rare stone.\nThe wound she gives cannot be healed with grass,\nsince I have travelled, through the plains and hills,\nto find my release from such a woman,\nyet from her light had never a shadow\nthrown on me, by hill, wall, or leaves\x92 green.\n\nI have seen her walk all dressed in green,\nso formed she would have sparked love in a stone,\nthat love I bear for her very shadow,\nso that I wished her, in those fields of grass,\nas much in love as ever yet was woman,\nclosed around by all the highest hills.\n\nThe rivers will flow upwards to the hills\nbefore this wood, that is so soft and green,\ntakes fire, as might ever lovely woman,\nfor me, who would choose to sleep on stone,\nall my life, and go eating grass,\nonly to gaze at where her clothes cast shadow.\n\nWhenever the hills cast blackest shadow,\nwith her sweet green, the lovely woman\nhides it, as a man hides stone in grass.\n\n\n\nSestina: Altaforte\nby Ezra Pound\n\nLOQUITUR: En Bertrans de Born.\nDante Alighieri put this man in hell for that he was a stirrer up of strife.\nEccovi!\nJudge ye!\nHave I dug him up again?\n\nThe scene is at his castle, Altaforte.\nPapiols is his jongleur.\nThe Leopard is the device of Richard Coeur de Lion.\n\nI\n\nDamn it all! all this our South stinks peace.\nYou whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let\'s to music!\nI have no life save when the swords clash.\nBut ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposing\nAnd the broad fields beneath them turn crimson,\nThen howls my heart nigh mad with rejoicing.\n\nII\n\nIn hot summer have I great rejoicing\nWhen the tempests kill the earth\'s foul peace,\nAnd the lightnings from black heav\'n flash crimson,\nAnd the fierce thunders roar me their music\nAnd the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing,\nAnd through all the riven skies God\'s swords clash.\n\nIII\n\nHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!\nAnd the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing,\nSpiked breast to spiked breast opposing!\nBetter one hour\'s stour than a year\'s peace\nWith fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music!\nBah! there\'s no wine like the blood\'s crimson!\n\nIV\n\nAnd I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson.\nAnd I watch his spears through the dark clash\nAnd it fills all my heart with rejoicing\nAnd pries wide my mouth with fast music\nWhen I see him so scorn and defy peace,\nHis lone might \'gainst all darkness opposing.\n\nV\n\nThe man who fears war and squats opposing\nMy words for stour, hath no blood of crimson\nBut is fit only to rot in womanish peace\nFar from where worth\'s won and the swords clash\nFor the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;\nYea, I fill all the air with my music.\n\nVI\n\nPapiols, Papiols, to the music!\nThere\'s no sound like to swords swords opposing,\nNo cry like the battle\'s rejoicing\nWhen our elbows and swords drip the crimson\nAnd our charges \'gainst The Leopard\'s rush clash.\nMay God damn for ever all who cry Peace!\n\nVII\n\nAnd let the music of the swords make them crimson!\nHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!\nHell blot black for always the thought Peace!\n\n\n\nPaysage Moralis\xe9\nby W. H. Auden\n\nHearing of harvests rotting in the valleys,\nSeeing at end of street the barren mountains,\nRound corners coming suddenly on water,\nKnowing them shipwrecked who were launched for islands,\nWe honour founders of these starving cities\nWhose honour is the image of our sorrow,\n\nWhich cannot see its likeness in their sorrow\nThat brought them desperate to the brink of valleys;\nDreaming of evening walks through learned cities\nThey reined their violent horses on the mountains,\nThose fields like ships to castaways on islands,\nVisions of green to them who craved for water.\n\nThey built by rivers and at night the water\nRunning past windows comforted their sorrow;\nEach in his little bed conceived of islands\nWhere every day was dancing in the valleys\nAnd all the green trees blossomed on the mountains,\nWhere love was innocent, being far from cities.\n\nBut dawn came back and they were still in cities;\nNo marvellous creature rose up from the water;\nThere was still gold and silver in the mountains\nBut hunger was a more immediate sorrow,\nAlthough to moping villagers in valleys\nSome waving pilgrims were describing islands \x85\n\n\'The gods,\' they promised, \'visit us from islands,\nAre stalking, head-up, lovely, through our cities;\nNow is the time to leave your wretched valleys\nAnd sail with them across the lime-green water,\nSitting at their white sides, forget your sorrow,\nThe shadow cast across your lives by mountains.\x92\n\nSo many, doubtful, perished in the mountains,\nClimbing up crags to get a view of islands,\nSo many, fearful, took with them their sorrow\nWhich stayed them when they reached unhappy cities,\nSo many, careless, dived and drowned in water,\nSo many, wretched, would not leave their valleys.\n\nIt is our sorrow. Shall it melt? Then water\nWould gush, flush, green these mountains and these valleys,\nAnd we rebuild our cities, not dream of islands.\n\n\n\nSestina of the Tramp-Royal\nby Rudyard Kipling\n\nSpeakin\' in general, I \'ave tried \'em all,\nThe \'appy roads that take you o\'er the world.\nSpeakin\' in general, I \'ave found them good\nFor such as cannot use one bed too long,\nBut must get \'ence, the same as I \'ave done,\nAn\' go observin\' matters till they die.\n\nWhat do it matter where or \'ow we die,\nSo long as we\'ve our \'ealth to watch it all\x97\nThe different ways that different things are done,\nAn\' men an\' women lovin\' in this world\x97\nTakin\' our chances as they come along,\nAn\' when they ain\'t, pretendin\' they are good?\n\nIn cash or credit\x97no, it aren\'t no good;\nYou \'ave to \'ave the \'abit or you\'d die,\nUnless you lived your life but one day long,\nNor didn\'t prophesy nor fret at all,\nBut drew your tucker some\'ow from the world,\nAn\' never bothered what you might ha\' done.\n\nBut, Gawd, what things are they I \'aven\'t done?\nI\'ve turned my \'and to most, an\' turned it good,\nIn various situations round the world\x97\nFor \'im that doth not work must surely die;\nBut that\'s no reason man should labour all\n\'Is life on one same shift; life\'s none so long.\n\nTherefore, from job to job I\'ve moved along.\nPay couldn\'t \'old me when my time was done,\nFor something in my \'ead upset me all,\nTill I \'ad dropped whatever \'twas for good,\nAn\', out at sea, be\'eld the dock-lights die,\nAn\' met my mate\x97the wind that tramps the world!\n\nIt\'s like a book, I think, this bloomin\' world,\nWhich you can read and care for just so long,\nBut presently you feel that you will die\nUnless you get the page you\'re readin\' done,\nAn\' turn another\x97likely not so good;\nBut what you\'re after is to turn \'em all.\n\nGawd bless this world! Whatever she \'ath done\x97\nExcep\' when awful long\x97I\'ve found it good.\nSo write, before I die, \'E liked it all!\n\n\n\nTwo Lorries \nby Seamus Heaney\n\nIt\'s raining on black coal and warm wet ashes.\nThere are tyre-marks in the yard, Agnew\'s old lorry\nHas all its cribs down and Agnew the coalman\nWith his Belfast accent\'s sweet-talking my mother.\nWould she ever go to a film in Magherafelt?\nBut it\'s raining and he still has half the load\n\nTo deliver farther on. This time the lode\nOur coal came from was silk-black, so the ashes\nWill be the silkiest white. The Magherafelt\n(Via Toomebridge) bus goes by. The half-stripped lorry\nWith its emptied, folded coal-bags moves my mother:\nThe tasty ways of a leather-aproned coalman!\n\nAnd films no less! The conceit of a coalman ...\nShe goes back in and gets out the black lead\nAnd emery paper, this nineteen-forties mother,\nAll business round her stove, half-wiping ashes\nWith a backhand from her cheek as the bolted lorry\nGets revved and turned and heads for Magherafelt\n\nAnd the last delivery. Oh, Magherafelt!\nOh, dream of red plush and a city coalman\nAs time fastforwards and a different lorry\nGroans into shot, up Broad Street, with a payload\nThat will blow the bus station to dust and ashes ...\nAfter that happened, I\'d a vision of my mother,\n\nA revenant on the bench where I would meet her\nIn that cold-floored waiting room in Magherafelt,\nHer shopping bags full up with shovelled ashes.\nDeath walked out past her like a dust-faced coalman\nRefolding body-bags, plying his load\nEmpty upon empty, in a flurry\n\nOf motes and engine-revs, but which lorry\nWas it now? Young Agnew\'s or that other,\nHeavier, deadlier one, set to explode\nIn a time beyond her time in Magherafelt ...\nSo tally bags and sweet-talk darkness, coalman,\nListen to the rain spit in new ashes\n\nAs you heft a load of dust that was Magherafelt,\nThen reappear from your lorry as my mother\'s\nDreamboat coalman filmed in silk-white ashes.\n\n\nVOCABULARY\n\'lorry\': British for truck\n\'cribs\': hinged sides\n\'Magherafelt\': (pronounced Mackerafelt) a town in Northern Ireland\n\'lode\': a vein or seam rich in minerals; in this case, coal\n\'black lead\': preparation for polishing the exterior of black \niron stoves\n\'emery paper\': sandpaper used for smoothing rough surfaces\n\'bolted\': the lorry\'s sides were put up and locked into place\n\'red plush\': for many people the red velvety seats in cinemas represented luxury\n\'payload\': profit-making cargo; the term is also used for the explosive capacity\nof a bomber\n\'revenant\': ghost\n\'motes\': dust\n\'tally bags\': coal sacks marked so they can be counted and checked off\n\'heft\': lift\n\'dreamboat\': 1940s word for a highly attractive member of the opposite sex\n\'filmed\': covered with a film of ashes (but the idea of a cinema film\x97black \nand white in the 1940s\x97is also present)\n\n\nHISTORY\nIn 1801, under the Act of Union, Ireland was united with the rest of Britain, \nbut the government paid little attention to \nIreland\'s social and economic problems. Catholics continued to be disadvantaged. Their discontent \ninspired nationalism, and the struggle for Irish freedom (Home \nRule) escalated. In 1919 the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was founded.\nIn 1921 the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed and Ireland was divided in two. Six of \nthe nine counties of Ulster became Northern Ireland, part of the UK. The rest of \nthe country became the Irish Free State (later Eire, and then the Republic of \nIreland). The IRA continued its fight for a unified Ireland. In Northern \nIreland, most Protestants were determined to remain British; but a third of \nNorthern Ireland\'s population were Catholics. They suffered from \nProtestant discrimination, \nwhich led to the growth of a strong civil rights movement in the 1960s. Both \nsides contained hardline militants who campaigned with violence, and in1966 the \nUlster Volunteer Force declared war on the IRA.\nIn 1968 the period known as the Troubles began. After riots and armed attacks in \nUlster, the British government sent in troops. Years of violence followed in \nwhich thousands, many of them innocent bystanders, were killed. One of the many \ntowns subjected to IRA bomb attacks was Magherafelt. Seamus Heaney was born on a \nfarm not far from Magherafelt, in 1939.\n\n\n\n\nYe Goat-herd Gods\nby Sir Philip Sidney (1590)\n\nStrephon.\nYe Goatherd gods, that love the grassy mountains,\nYe nymphs which haunt the springs in pleasant valleys,\nYe satyrs joyed with free and quiet forests,\nVouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,\nWhich to my woes gives still an early morning,\nAnd draws the dolor on till weary evening.\n\nKlaius.\nO Mercury, foregoer to the evening,\nO heavenly huntress of the savage mountains,\nO lovely star, entitled of the morning\nWhile that my voice doth fill these woeful valleys,\nVouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,\nWhich oft hath Echo tired in secret forests.\n\nStrephon.\nI that was once free burgess of the forests,\nWhere shade from Sun, and sport I sought in evening,\nI, that was once esteemed for pleasant music,\nAm banished now among the monstrous mountains\nOf huge despair, and foul affliction\x92s valleys,\nAm grown a screech-owl to myself each morning.\n\nKlaius.\nI that was once delighted every morning\nHunting the wild inhabiters of forests,\nI, that was once the music of these valleys\nSo darkened am, that all my day is evening,\nHeart-broken so, that molehills seem high mountains,\nAnd fill the vales with cries instead of music.\n\nStrephon.\nLong since alas, my deadly swannish music\nHath made itself a crier of the morning\nAnd hath with wailing strength climbed highest mountains;\nLong since my thoughts more desert be than forests,\nLong since I see my joys come to their evening,\nAnd state thrown down to over-trodden valleys.\n\nKlaius.\nLong since the happy dwellers of these valleys\nHave prayed me leave my strange exclaiming music,\nWhich troubles their day\x92s work, and joys of evening;\nLong since I hate the night, more hate the morning;\nLong since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forests,\nAnd make me wish myself laid under mountains.\n\nStrephon.\nMeseems I see the high and stately mountains\nTransform themselves to low dejected valleys;\nMeseems I hear in these ill-changed forests\nThe nightingales do learn of owls their music;\nMeseems I feel the comfort of the morning\nTurned to the mortal serene of an evening.\n\nKlaius.\nMeseems I see a filthy cloudy evening\nAs soon as sun begins to climb the mountains;\nMeseems I feel a noisome scent, the morning\nWhen I do smell the flowers of these valleys;\nMeseems I hear, when I do hear sweet music,\nThe dreadful cries of murdered men in forests.\n\nStrephon.\nI wish to fire the trees of all these forests;\nI give the sun a last farewell each evening;\nI curse the fiddling finders-out of music;\nWith envy I do hate the lofty mountains\nAnd with despite despise the humble valleys;\nI do detest night, evening, day, and morning.\n\nKlaius.\nCurse to myself my prayer is, the morning;\nMy fire is more than can be made with forests,\nMy state more base than are the basest valleys;\nI wish no evenings more to see, each evening;\nShamed, I hate myself in sight of mountains\nAnd stop mine ears, lest I grow mad with music.\n\nStrephon.\nFor she, whose parts maintained a perfect music,\nWhose beauties shined more than the blushing morning,\nWho much did pass in state the stately mountains,\nIn straightness passed the cedars of the forests,\nHath cast me, wretch, into eternal evening\nBy taking her two suns from these dark valleys.\n\nKlaius.\nFor she, with whom compared, the Alps are valleys,\nShe, whose least word brings from the spheres their music,\nAt whose approach the sun rose in the evening,\nWho, where she went, bare in her forehead morning,\nIs gone, is gone from these our spoiled forests,\nTurning to deserts our best pastured mountains.\n\nStrephon.\nThese mountains witness shall, so shall these valleys,\nKlaius.\nThese forests eke, made wretched by our music,\nOur morning hymn this is, and song at evening.\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best sestinas ever, according to me. I\'m sure every \r\nreader\'s choices will be different, but if you added a poem or three to yours, \r\nhaving read mine, hopefully you will consider your time here well spent.\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Best Sonnets,\nThe Best Villanelles,\nThe Best Sestinas,\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels,\r\n\r\nThe Best Kyrielles,\nThe Best Couplets,\r\nThe Best Haiku,\r\n\r\nThe Best Poem of All Time,\r\n\r\nThe Best Limericks,\r\n\r\nThe Best Nonsense Verse,\r\n\r\nThe Best \nLight Verse,\r\nThe Best Poems Ever Written, \r\nThe Best Poets,\r\nThe Best of the Masters,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Poems in the English Language,\r\nThe Best American Poetry,\r\nThe Best Poetry Translations,\r\nThe Best Ancient Greek Epigrams and Epitaphs,\r\nThe Best Anglo-Saxon Riddles and Kennings,\r\nThe Best Old English Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Lyric Poetry,\r\nThe Best Free Verse, \r\nThe Best Story Poems,\r\nThe Best Narrative Poems,\r\nThe Best Epic Poems,\r\nThe Best Epigrams,\r\nThe Best Poems for Kids,\r\n\r\nThe Most Beautiful Lines in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Quatrains Ever,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Sonnets in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments,\r\nThe Best Holocaust Poetry,\r\nThe Best Hiroshima Poetry,\r\nThe Best Anti-War Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Religious Poetry,\r\nThe Best Spiritual Poetry, \r\nThe Best Heretical Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Thanksgiving Poems,\r\nThe Best Autumnal Poems,\r\nThe Best Fall/Autumn Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Vampire Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Love Poems,\r\nThe Best Urdu Love Poetry, \r\nThe Best Erotic Poems,\r\nThe Best Romantic Poetry,\r\nThe Best Love Songs Ever,\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Movies of All Time,\r\nVisions of Beauty,\r\nThe Best Poems about Death and Loss,\r\nWhat is \r\nPoetry?, \r\nThe Best Antinatalist Poems and Prose,\r\nEngland\'s Greatest Artists\r\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
