My favorite animal poem is The Wild \nSwans at Coole, an intensely beautiful word painting by the great Irish poet \nWilliam Butler Yeats. Other masterpieces include The Death of a Toad by Richard \nWilbur, The Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy, \nThe Tyger and The Little Lamb by William Blake, The Fish and The \nArmadillo by Elizabeth Bishop, Skunk Hour by Robert Lowell, and Hurt \nHawks by Robinson Jeffers. For readers who care about such things, I have \nprovided my admittedly highly subjective list of the greatest animal poems in \nthe English language, below. \n\nby Michael R.

They love each other.\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\nAt home once more,\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\nFor she has walked over to me\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\nShe is black and white,\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\nSuddenly I realize\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\nInto blossom.\n\n\n\nThe Hippopotamus\nby Hillaire Belloc\n\nI shoot the Hippopotamus\n  With bullets made of platinum,\nBecause if I use leaden ones\n  His hide is sure to flatten \'em.\n\n\n\nLeda and the Swan\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\n\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\n\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\n Being so caught up,\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\n\n\n\nCome slowly, Eden\nby Emily Dickinson\n\nCome slowlyEden\nLips unused to thee\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\nAs the fainting bee\n\nReaching late his flower,\nRound her chamber hums\nCounts his nectarsalights\nAnd is lost in balms!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\nThe woodland paths are dry,\nUnder the October twilight the water\nMirrors a still sky;\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\nSince I first made my count;\nI saw, before I had well finished,\nAll suddenly mount\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\nAnd now my heart is sore.\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\nThe first time on this shore,\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\nThey paddle in the cold,\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water\nMysterious, beautiful;\nAmong what rushes will they build,\nBy what lakes edge or pool\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\nTo find they have flown away?\n\n\n\nThe Death of a Toad\nby Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep monotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard daylight steer.\n\n\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\nby Walt Whitman\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\n\n\n The Most of It\nby Robert Frost\n\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\nBut counterlove, original response.\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\nInstead of proving human when it neared\nAnd someone else additional to him,\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\n\n\n\n\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\n\n\nI leant upon a coppice gate\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\n The weakening eye of day.\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\n Like strings of broken lyres,\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\n Had sought their household fires.\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\n The wind his death-lament.\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\nAnd every spirit upon earth\n Seemed fervourless as I.\nAt once a voice arose among\n The bleak twigs overhead\nIn a full-hearted evensong\n Of joy illimited;\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\n In blast-beruffled plume,\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\n Upon the growing gloom.\nSo little cause for carolings\n Of such ecstatic sound\nWas written on terrestrial things\n Afar or nigh around,\nThat I could think there trembled through\n His happy good-night air\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\n And I was unaware.\n\n\n\nThe Tyger\nby William Blake\n\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\nIn the forests of the night\nWhat immortal hand or eye\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\n\nAnd what shoulder,  what art,\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\nWhat dread hand?  what dread feet?\n\nWhat the hammer? what the chain?\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp\nDare its deadly terrors clasp?\n\nWhen the stars threw down their spears,\nAnd water\'d heaven with their tears,\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\n\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\nIn the forests of the night,\nWhat immortal hand or eye\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\n\n\nThe Eagle and the Mole\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\n\nAvoid the reeking herd,\nShun the polluted flock,\nLive like that stoic bird,\nThe eagle of the rock.\n\nThe huddled warmth of crowds\nBegets and fosters hate;\nHe keeps above the clouds\nHis cliff inviolate.\n\nWhen flocks are folded warm,\nAnd herds to shelter run,\nHe sails above the storm,\nHe stares into the sun.\n\nIf in the eagle\'s track\nYour sinews cannot leap,\nAvoid the lathered pack,\nTurn from the steaming sheep.\n\nIf you would keep your soul\nFrom spotted sight or sound,\nLive like the velvet mole:\nGo burrow underground.\n\nAnd there hold intercourse\nWith roots of trees and stones,\nWith rivers at their source,\nAnd disembodied bones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA friend of the great Scottish poet Robert Burns explains how he came to immortalize a lowly field  mouse: This beautiful poem was imagined while the poet was \nholding the plough, on the farm of Mossgiel: the field is still pointed out, and \na man called Blane is still living, who says he was gaudsman to the bard at the \ntime, and chased the mouse with the plough-pettle, for which he was rebuked by \nhis young master, who inquired what harm the poor mouse had done him. In the \nnight that followed, Burns awoke his gaudsman, who was in the same bed with him, \nrecited the poem as it now stands, and said, \'What think you of our mouse now?\'\n\nTo a Mouse\nby Robert Burns\nmodern English translation by\nMichael R. Burch\n\nWee, sleeket, cowran, tim\'rous beastie,Sleek, tiny, timorous, cowering \nbeast,\nO, what panic\'s in thy breastie!why\'s such panic in your \nbreast?\nThou need na start awa sae hasty,Why dash away, so \nquick, so rash,Wi\' \nbickering brattle! in a frenzied flash\nI wad be laith to rin an\' chase thee,when \nI would be loath to run \nafter you\nWi\' murd\'ring pattle! with a murderous plowstaff!\n\nI\'m truly sorry Man\'s dominionI\'m truly sorry Man\'s dominion\nHas broken Nature\'s social union, has broken Nature\'s social union,\nAn\' justifies that ill opinion,and justifies that bad \nopinion\nWhich makes thee startle, which makes you startle,\nAt me, thy poor, earth-born companion,when I\'m your poor, earth-born \ncompanion\nAn\' fellow-mortal! and fellow mortal!\n\nI doubt na, whyles, but thou may thieve;I have no doubt you sometimes \nthieve;\nWhat then? poor beastie, thou maun live!What of it, friend?

The poem To a Louse resulted from his observations. The poor woman had no idea that she would be the \nsubject of one of Burns\' best poems about how we see ourselves, compared to how other \npeople see us at our worst moments.\n\nTo a Louse\n\nby Robert Burns\nmodern English translation by\nMichael R. Burch\n\n\nHa! Whare ye gaun, ye crowlin ferlie?Hey!

My heart in hiding\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\n\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\n\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\n\n\n\nCold-Blooded Creatures\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\n\nMan, the egregious egoist\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\nImagines, by some mental twist,\nThat he alone is sentient\n\nOf the intolerable load\nThat on all living creatures lies,\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\n\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fish\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nI caught a tremendous fish\nand held him beside the boat\nhalf out of water, with my hook\nfast in a corner of his mouth.\nHe didn\'t fight.\nHe hadn\'t fought at all.\nHe hung a grunting weight,\nbattered and venerable\nand homely.  Here and there\nhis brown skin hung in strips\nlike ancient wallpaper,\nand its pattern of darker brown\nwas like wallpaper:\nshapes like full-blown roses\nstained and lost through age.\nHe was speckled with barnacles,\nfine rosettes of lime,\nand infested\nwith tiny white sea-lice,\nand underneath two or three\nrags of green weed hung down.\nWhile his gills were breathing in\nthe terrible oxygen\nthe frightening gills,\nfresh and crisp with blood,\nthat can cut so badly\nI thought of the coarse white flesh\npacked in like feathers,\nthe big bones and the little bones,\nthe dramatic reds and blacks\nof his shiny entrails,\nand the pink swim-bladder\nlike a big peony.\nI looked into his eyes\nwhich were far larger than mine\nbut shallower, and yellowed,\nthe irises backed and packed\nwith tarnished tinfoil\nseen through the lenses\nof old scratched isinglass.\nThey shifted a little, but not\nto return my stare.\nIt was more like the tipping\nof an object toward the light.\nI admired his sullen face,\nthe mechanism of his jaw,\nand then I saw\nthat from his lower lip\nif you could call it a lip\ngrim, wet, and weaponlike,\nhung five old pieces of fish-line,\nor four and a wire leader\nwith the swivel still attached,\nwith all their five big hooks\ngrown firmly in his mouth.\nA green line, frayed at the end\nwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,\nand a fine black thread\nstill crimped from the strain and snap\nwhen it broke and he got away.\nLike medals with their ribbons\nfrayed and wavering,\na five-haired beard of wisdom\ntrailing from his aching jaw.\nI stared and stared\nand victory filled up\nthe little rented boat,\nfrom the pool of bilge\nwhere oil had spread a rainbow\naround the rusted engine\nto the bailer rusted orange,\nthe sun-cracked thwarts,\nthe oarlocks on their strings,\nthe gunnelsuntil everything\nwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!\nAnd I let the fish go.\n\n\n\nThe Armadilloby Elizabeth Bishop\nfor Robert Lowell\n\n      This is the time of year\n      when almost every night\n      the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.\n      Climbing the mountain height,\n     \n      rising toward a saint\n      still honored in these parts,\n      the paper chambers flush and fill with light\n      that comes and goes, like hearts.\n     \n      Once up against the sky it\'s hard\n      to tell them from the stars \n      planets, that is  the tinted ones:\n      Venus going down, or Mars,\n     \n      or the pale green one. With a wind,\n      they flare and falter, wobble and toss;\n      but if it\'s still they steer between\n      the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,\n     \n      receding, dwindling, solemnly\n      and steadily forsaking us,\n      or, in the downdraft from a peak,\n      suddenly turning dangerous.\n     \n      Last night another big one fell.\n      It splattered like an egg of fire\n      against the cliff behind the house.\n      The flame ran down. We saw the pair\n     \n      of owls who nest there flying up\n      and up, their whirling black-and-white\n      stained bright pink underneath, until\n      they shrieked up out of sight.\n     \n      The ancient owls\' nest must have burned.\n      Hastily, all alone,\n      a glistening armadillo left the scene,\n      rose-flecked, head down, tail down,\n     \n      and then a baby rabbit jumped out,\n      short-eared, to our surprise.\n      So soft!  a handful of intangible ash\n      with fixed, ignited eyes.\n     \n      Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!\n      O falling fire and piercing cry\n      and panic, and a weak mailed fist\n      clenched ignorant against the sky!\n\n\n\n \n\nHope Is a Thing with Feathersby Emily Dickinson\n\nHope is a thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul\nAnd sings a tune without words\nAnd never stops at all.\n\nAnd sweetest, in the gale, is heard\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little bird\nThat keeps so many warm.\n\nIve heard it in the chilliest land\nAnd on the strangest sea\nYet, never, in extremity\nIt ask a crumb of me.\n\n\n\nThe Mallard\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe mallard is a fellow\nwhose lips are long and yellow\nwith which he, honking, kisses\nhis bawdy, boisterous mistress;\nmy pond\x92s their loud bordello!\n\n\nThe Platypus\nby Michael R.
