Burch\n\nThe English language has a rich and varied history. Modern English is not a single monolithic language, but a loose confluence of \nlanguages that merged (and frequently diverged) over the course of time. On this \npage I \nhope to trace various outside \ninfluences on English poetry, beginning with some of the best Old English poems, then working forward toward the present. In \nthe process we will consider the work of outstanding Scottish, Irish and Welsh poets such as Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, \nGeorge Gordon (Lord Byron), William Butler Yeats and Dylan Thomas. We will also examine the work of lesser-known poets such as William \nDunbar, Robert Louis Stevenson, Ethna Carbery, Louis MacNeice, Hugh MacDiarmid and Seamus Cassidy. While English was the first language of \nmany of these poets, they were profoundly influenced by the language and lore of their homelands, so they were still, to some degree, \noutlanders. As we consider their work, we will consider how they influenced \nmodern English poetry.\n\nI\'ll begin with one of my all-time favorites, Wulf and Eadwacer, an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poem that appeared in the Exeter \nBook, which has been dated to around 960-990 AD. Wulf and Eadwacer was probably written at an earlier date, but much about \nthe poem remains in doubt, including its meaning. For example, one translator believes the speaker means they will kill him while \nanother thinks she means they will thank him. That\'s quite a difference! In my admittedly loose translation, which borrows from \nearlier translations, I took the liberty of assuming that the woman speaking is surrounded by kidnappers intent on keeping her apart from her \ndangerous lover, Wulf ...\n\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon/Old English poem, circa 960-990 AD or earlier)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMy people pursue him like crippled game.\nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\nHis island is fast, surrounded by fens.\nThere are savage curs on this island.\nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\nBut whenever it rained and I woke, disconsolate,\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\nGood feelings for him, but their end loathsome!\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat!\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A wolf has borne\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\nOne can easily sunder what never was one:\nour song together.\n\nThis is one of the first truly great poems in the Old English [OE] language, and it accomplishes a number of important firsts. \nIt is unique in OE literature for its passionate sex-intrigue [Martin S. Day]. Also, there is no Christian element \n[Day], meaning the poem was not sanitized by Christian monks, as Beowulf was in places, and as the Arthurian legends were virtually \neverywhere. Therefore the poem gives us an uncensored glimpse into the hearts and minds of our ancestors: the speaker seems almost primal. \nFurthermore, this poem and Deor\'s Lament are the only extant OE poems with stanza and refrain [Day]. The stunning \ncomparison of a loveless relationship to a song in which two voices never really harmonized is one the first great metaphors in \nEnglish poetry. And perhaps most importantly, Wulf and Eadwacer illustrates how the hairy words of our ancestors can \nremain startlingly fresh and effective today. Poets like John Clare, who wrote centuries later, have written in a similar earthy \nstyle ...\n\nMouse\'s Nest\nby John Clare\n\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\n proged it as I passed  went away\n when I looked I fancied something stirred\n turned again  hoped to catch the bird\nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheat\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats\nShe looked so odd  so grotesque to me\nI ran  wondered what the thing could be\n pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood\nWhen the mouse hurried from the crawling brood\nThe young ones squeaked  when I went away\nShe found her nest again among the hay\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\n broad old cesspools glittered in the sun\n\nThe earliest English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn. It was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According \nto the Venerable Bede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who was given the gift of poetic composition by an angel. Here is my \nmodern English \ntranslation of the poem ...\n\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNow let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the eternal Lord,\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\nThen he, the first Poet, created heaven as a roof\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\nGuardian of mankind. Then he, the eternal Lord,\nafterwards made men middle earth: Master almighty!\n\nIn the original poem, hardly a word is recognizable as English. C\xe6dmon was writing in a somewhat Anglicized form of ancient German. The \nword England harkens back to Angle-land; the Angles were a Germanic tribe. Nevertheless, by C\xe6dmon\'s time the foundations of \nEnglish poetry were being laid, particularly in the areas of accentual meter and alliteration. Lines from C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn remind me of the much later work of Gerard Manley \nHopkins. For instance, compare the first line above to certain lines from this poem by Hopkins ...\n\nThe Windhover\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\n\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\n Buckle! And the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\n\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\n\nOf course the best-known Anglo-Saxon poem is Beowulf, which is too long for my purposes here. But let these fine lines from a \ntranslation by Francis B. Gummere suffice for a quick peek up the language\'s skirt ...\n\nBeowulf (anonymous Old English Epic Poem, circa 7th to 11th century AD)\n\nLO, praise of the prowess of people-kings\nof spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,\nwe have heard, and what honor the athelings\twon!\n\nBeowulf may have been written around the time of C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn or it may have been written much later; it has been \ndated as early as the 7th century AD and as late as the 11th century. It is interesting to note that, despite the seeming alienness of the \npoem, its opening line is comprised of words that relate directly to modern English:\n\nHweat we gar-Dena in gear-dagum\nWhat we spear-Danes in yore-days\n\nGar means spear in German (a gar is a spear fish). Yore-days are days of yore. \nThere are many translations of Beowulf available today, so readers interested in revisiting the great Anglo-German epic should be \nable to find versions to their individual likings. Now let\'s look at another poem found in the Exeter Book, meaning that it was \nprobably written no later than 990 AD. The translation below is by Gavin Bantock ...\n\nThe Wanderer (anonymous Old English Elegy, circa 990 AD)\n\nOften the solitary man waits for God\'s mercy,\nthough he for a long while in sorrowful mood\nhas to stir back the rime-cold ocean\nwith oars, with the strength of his own hands,\nto go in the tracks of exile over the sea. Fate\nthat is relentless. Thus remembering\nthe hardship of cruel slaughters\nand the fall of kinsmen friends,\nthe wanderer spoke: ...\n\nHere\'s one of the first English poems to employ a refrain:\n\nDeor\'s Lament (Anglo Saxon Lament, circa 10th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWeland knew the agony of exile.\nThat indomitable smith was wracked by grief.\nHe endured countless troubles:\nsorrows were his only companions\nin his frozen island dungeon\nafter Nithad had fettered him,\nmany strong-but-supple sinew-bonds\nbinding the better man.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nBeadohild mourned her brothers\' deaths\nbut even more, her own sad state\nonce she discovered herself with child.\nShe predicted nothing good could come of it.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nWe have heard that the Geat\'s moans for Matilda,\nhis lady, were limitless,\nthat his sorrowful love for her\nrobbed him of regretless sleep.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nFor thirty winters Theodric ruled\nthe M\xe6ring stronghold with an iron hand;\nmany knew this and moaned.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nWe have also heard of Ermanaric\'s wolfish ways,\nof\nhow he held wide sway in the realm of the Goths.\nHe was a grim king! Many a warrior sat,\nfull of cares and maladies of the mind,\nwishing constantly that his kingdom might be overthrown.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nIf a man sits long enough, sorrowful and anxious,\nbereft of joy, his mind constantly darkening,\nsoon it seems to him that his troubles are endless.\nThen he must consider that the wise Lord\noften moves through the earth\ngranting some men honor, glory and fame,\nbut others only shame and hardship.\nThis I will say for myself:\nthat for awhile I was the Heodeninga\'s scop,\ndear to my lord. My name was Deor.\nFor many winters I held a fine office,\nfaithfully serving a just lord. But now Heorrenda\na man skilful in songs, has received the estate\nthe protector of warriors gave me.\nThat passed away; this also may.\n\nHere are two poems from the early 13th century that may predate Chaucer. Please note the introduction of end rhyme ...\n\nHow Long the Night (anonymous Old English Lyric, circa early 13th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIt is pleasant, indeed, while the summer lasts\nwith the mild pheasants\' song ...\nbut now I feel the northern wind\'s blast\nits severe weather strong.\nAlas! Alas! This night seems so long!\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\n\nPity Mary (anonymous Old English Lyric, circa early 13th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNow the sun passes under the wood:\nI rue, Mary, thy facefair, good.\nNow the sun passes under the tree:\nI rue, Mary, thy son and thee.\n\nIn the poem above, note how wood and tree invoke the cross, while sun and son seem to invoke \neach other. Sun-day is also Son-day, to Christians. The birthday of Jesus Christ was changed to the 25th day of December several hundred years \nafter the fact, because the winter solstice marks the resurrection of the sun as the days begin to lengthen, heralding spring and \ncrops to come. December 25th was celebrated as the birthday of Sol Invictus and Constantine, the first Roman emperor to adopt Christianity as \none of the official state religions of Rome, was a worshiper of Sol Invictus. The anonymous poet who wrote the poem above may have been been \npunning the words sun and son with such things in mind. Now, moving quickly forward in time, here\'s an excerpt \nfrom Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer ...\n\nCanterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer (1343-1400)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen April with her sweet showers\nhas pierced the drought of March to the root,\nbathing the veins of virginal vines in such nectar\nthat even sweeter flowers are engendered,\nand when Zephyr also with his immaculate breath\nhas inspired in every grove and glade\nthe tender crops; and when the young sun\nhas run half his course through Aries the Ram,\nand when small birds make melodies\nafter sleeping all night with eyes wide open\nbecause Nature pierces them through to their hearts\nthen people long to go on pilgrimages ...\n\nThe two medieval English poems below may have been written around the time of Chaucer, or perhaps earlier ...\n\nFowles in the Frith (anonymous Medieval English Lyric, circa 13th-14th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe birds in the wood,\nthe fishes in the flood ...\nand I must go mad:\nmuch sorrow I walk with,\nfor beasts of bone and blood.\n\nI am of Ireland (anonymous Medieval Irish Lyric, circa 13th-14th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI am of Ireland,\nand of the holy land of Ireland.\nGood sir, I pray thee:\nfor the sake of holy charity,\ncome dance with me\nin Ireland.\n\nThe poem immediately above still smacks of German, as the first line reads: Ich am of Irlaunde. But a German would have said \nIch bin so a metamorphosis was in progress. English was becoming a language in its own right, and English poets had a number of \nnon-Germanic influences, including the Celts, Greeks, Romans and Vikings. The ancient Celts seemed to favor myths and poems in which the \nearthly and otherworldly were juxtaposed. We can still see their influence in the dragons, witches and warlocks of the now heavily \nChristianized Arthurian legends. But our poetic forbears were by no means prudes, regardless of what Christian monks did when they \nsanitized their work (I accidentally typed satanized on my first attempt!). And the early English poets whose names we \nremember today were by no means one-track thinkers: they had numerous influences, including Greek, Roman/Italian, French and Norse poetry, \nin addition to the Bible. Thomas Wyatt (1503-1524) was one of the first great English poets; his primary influence was an Italian poet, \nPetrarch. Wyatt wrote wonderfully original English poems under the influence ...\n\nThey Flee from Me\nby Thomas Wyatt\n\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\nThat now are wild and do not remember\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\n\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\n\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\n\nAnother early poet who still reads well today is the French poet Charles D\'Orleans [1391-1465], who was imprisoned in England for almost 25 years. Here \nare two wonderful rondels (a French form with repeated refrains, like a song sung in \nrounds) by D\'Orleans:\nRondel\nby\nCharles D\'Orleans\nStrengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart,\nAnd with some store of pleasure give me aid,\nFor jealousy, with all them of his part,\nStrong siege about the weary tower has laid.\nNay, if to break his bands thou art afraid,\nToo weak to make his cruel force depart,\nStrengthen at least this castle of my heart,\nAnd with some store of pleasure give me aid.\nNay, let not jealousy, for all his art\nBe master, and the tower in ruin laid,\nThat still, ah, Love, thy gracious rule obeyed.\nAdvance, and give me succor of my part;\nStrengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart.\n\nOft in My Thought\nby Charles D\'Orleans\n\nOft in my thought full busily have I sought\n Against the beginning of this fresh new year,\nWhat pretty thing that I best given ought\n To her that was mine hearte\'s lady dear; [heartes is pronounced heart-ess]\n But all that thought bitane is fro me clear [bitane=taken; fro=from]\n Since death, alas, hath closed her under clay\n And hath this world fornaked with her here [fornaked=stripped]\n God have her soul, I can no better say.\n\nBut for to keep in custom, lo, my thought,\n And of my seely service the manere, \n[seely=simple; manere=manner]\nIn showing als that I forget her not \n[als=also]\n Unto each wight, I shall to my powere \n[wight=person]\n This dead her serve with masses and prayere;\n For all too foul a shame were me, \nmafay, [mafay=by \nmy faith]\n Her to forget this time that nigheth near \n[nigheth near=draws near]\n God have her soul, I can no better say.\n\nTo her profit now nis there to be brought \n[nis=is not]\n None other thing all will I buy it dear; \n[all=although]\nWherefore, thou Lord that lordest all aloft, \n[lordest=rules]\n My deedes take, such as goodness steer,\n And crown her, Lord, within thine heavenly sphere\n As for most truest lady, may I say,\n Most good, most fair, and most benign of cheer \n[cheer=countenance]\n God have her soul, I can no better say.\n\nWhen I her praise, or praising of her hear,\nAlthough it whilom were to me pleasere, \n[whilom=formerly, pleasere=pleasure]\n It fill enough it doth my heart today,\nAnd doth me wish I clothed had my beir \n[doth=makes]\n God have her soul, I can no better say.\n\nHere is my attempt at a modern English translation \nof the poem:\n\nOft in My Thought\nby Charles D\'Orleans\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\n Around the advent of the fledgling year,\nFor something pretty that I really ought\n To give unto my lady dear;\n But that sweet thought\'s been wrested from me, clear,\n Since death, alas, has sealed her under clay\n And robbed the world of all that\'s precious here\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\n Acceptable, as suits my age\'s hour?\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\n Her worth? It tests my power!\n I serve her now with masses and with prayer;\n For it would be \na shame for me to stray\n Far from my faith, when my time\'s drawing near\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\n and the cost of everything became \nso dear;\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\n Take my good deeds, as many as there are,\n And crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\n As heaven\'s truest maid! And may I \nsay:\n Most good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\n Then my heart floods like an \noverflowing bay\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nThis is one of the best-known early English poems ...\n\nWestern Wind (anonymous Medieval English Lyric, circa 15th century AD)\n\nWestern wind, when wilt thou blow,\n The small rain down can rain?\nChrist, that my love were in my arms\n And I in my bed again!\n\nI should point out that there may be no absolutely authoritative text for such poems. I have seen other versions of the poem in major \nanthologies that substitute will for wilt in the first line, and if for that in the third line. \nBut the same is true for some of Shakespeare\'s plays, which seem to have been updated by the players who performed them, leaving us \nwith similar but different versions. Now here are two wonderful poems by an early Scottish master, William Dunbar ...\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\nwhose piteous death does my heart such terrible pain\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\nLament for the Makaris [Makers, or Poets]\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\ni who enjoyed good health and gladness\nam overwhelmed now by lifes terrible sickness\nand enfeebled with infirmity ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nour presence here is mere vainglory;\nthe false world is but transitory;\nthe flesh is frail; the Fiend runs free ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nthe state of man is changeable:\nnow sound, now sick, now blithe, now dull,\nnow manic, now devoid of glee ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nno state on earth stands here securely;\nas the wild wind shakes the willow tree,\nso wavers this worlds vanity ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nDeath leads the knights into the field\n(unarmored under helm and shield)\nsole Victor of each red m\xeal\xe9e ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nthat strange, despotic Beast\ntears from its mothers breast\nthe babe, full of benignity ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nHe takes the champion of the hour,\nthe captain of the highest tower,\nthe beautiful damsel in her tower ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nHe spares no lord for his elegance,\nnor clerk for his intelligence;\nHis dreadful stroke no man can flee ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nartist, magician, scientist,\norator, debater, theologist,\nmust all conclude, so too, as we:\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nin medicine the most astute\nsawbones and surgeons all fall mute;\nthey cannot save themselves, or flee ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\ni see the Makers among the unsaved;\nthe greatest of Poets all go to the grave;\nHe does not spare them their faculty ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\ni have seen Him pitilessly devour\nour noble Chaucer, poetrys flower,\nand Lydgate and Gower (great Trinity!) ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nsince He has taken my brothers all,\ni know He will not let me live past the fall;\nHis next prey will be  poor unfortunate me! ...\nhow the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nthere is no remedy for Death;\nwe all must prepare to relinquish breath\nso that after we die, we may be set free\nfrom the fear of Death dismays me!\n\nAs we examine the influence of Anglo-Saxon, Norse, Celtic, Scottish and Irish poetry on English poetry, we will continually see \ndark and otherworldly aspects. For instance, here\'s a wonderful early anonymous ballad with supernatural overtones ...\n\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song (anonymous Ballad, circa 1620 AD)\n\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\nThat into rags would rend ye,\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\nThat of your five sound senses\nYou never be forsaken,\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nOf thirty bare years have I\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\nI befell into this dotage.\nI slept not since the Conquest,\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\nMe music to my sorrow.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\nI sup, and when benighted,\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\nYet never am affrighted.\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nI know more than Apollo,\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\nI see the stars at mortal wars\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\nMe handle not nor spare not;\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\nDo what the panther dare not.\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWith an host of furious fancies,\nWhereof I am commander,\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\nTo the wilderness I wander.\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\nI summoned am to tourney\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\nMethinks it is no journey.\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nRobert Burns (1759-1796) has been called the national poet of Scotland. He wrote poems in standard English and in the Scots dialect. His \nbest-known poems tend to be those with a Scottish flavor that are still accessible to English readers. He was also a popular songsmith, most \nfamously penning Auld Lang Syne ...\n\nA Red, Red Rose\nby Robert Burns\n\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\n\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\n\nAfton Water\nby Robert Burns\n\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\nFlow gently, I\'ll sing thee a song in thy praise;\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\nThou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro\' the glen,\nYe wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,\nThou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,\nI charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.\nHow lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills,\nFar mark\'d with the courses of clear winding rills;\nThere daily I wander as noon rises high,\nMy flocks and my Mary\'s sweet cot in my eye.\nHow pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,\nWhere wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;\nThere oft, as mild Ev\'ning sweeps over the lea,\nThe sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.\nThy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,\nAnd winds by the cot where my Mary resides,\nHow wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,\nAs gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave.\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,\nFlow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;\nMy Mary\'s asleep by thy murmuring stream,\nFlow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.\n\nSir Walter Scott (1771-1832) was a Scottish poet, historian and novelist who was one of the first internationally acclaimed writers to work \nprimarily in English. His best-known work today is the historical novel Ivanhoe ...\n\nProud Maisie\nby Sir Walter Scott\n\nProud Maisie is in the wood\nWalking so early;\nSweet Robin sits on the bush,\nSinging so rarely.\n\n\'Tell me, thou bonny bird,\nWhen shall I marry me?\' \n\'When six braw gentlemen\nKirkward shall carry ye.\'\n\n\'Who makes the bridal bed,\nBirdie, say truly?\'\n\'The gray-headed sexton\nThat delves the grave duly.\'\n\n\'The glowworm o\'er grave and stone\nShall light thee steady,\nThe owl from the steeple sing,\n\'Welcome, proud lady.\'\n\nAlthough George Gordon (1788-1824, better known as Lord Byron) is generally considered an English poet, he was a descendent of King James I of \nScotland and received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School. His work often reflects the melancholy one tends to expect of \nScottish poets ...\n\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving\nby George Gordon, Lord Byron\n\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\n So late into the night,\nThough the heart be still as loving,\n And the moon be still as bright.\n\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\n And the soul outwears the breast,\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\n And love itself have rest.\n\nThough the night was made for loving,\n And the day returns too soon,\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\n By the light of the moon.\n\nRobert Louis Balfour Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist and travel writer. His best-known poem, Requiem \nis reminiscent of the elegy the Irish poet William Butler Yeats wrote for himself ...\n\nRequiem\nby Robert L. Stevenson\n\nUnder the wide and starry sky\nDig the grave and let me lie.\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\n\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\nHere he lies where he longed to be,\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\nAnd the hunter home from the hill.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865-1939) is generally considered the greatest of Irish poets, and deservedly so. His native language was English, but \nhis influences were many and varied. For instance the poem below is a loose translation of a poem by the French poet Ronsard ...\n\nWhen You Are Old\nby William Butler Yeats\nafter Ronsard\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\nWhen reading Irish, Scottish and Welsh poets, one should keep in mind that subjected people are seldom fans of their conquerors. Yeats \neloquently conveys the dilemma of an Irish pilot who ends up defending England from Germans during World War I ...\n\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\nThose that I guard I do not love;\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\nNo likely end could bring them loss\nOr leave them happier than before.\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\nA lonely impulse of delight\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\nA waste of breath the years behind\nIn balance with this life, this death.\n\nDylan Thomas (1914-1953) seems to have done for Welsh poets what Yeats did for Irish pilots, declaring independence to fly simply for the sake \nof flying, in this case for the sake of love and words ...\n\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nIn my craft or sullen art\nExercised in the still night\nWhen only the moon rages\nAnd the lovers lie abed\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\nI labour by singing light\nNot for ambition or bread\nOr the strut and trade of charms\nOn the ivory stages\nBut for the common wages\nOf their most secret heart.\nNot for the proud man apart\nFrom the raging moon I write\nOn these spindrift pages\nNor for the towering dead\nWith their nightingales and psalms\nBut for the lovers, their arms\nRound the griefs of the ages,\nWho pay no praise or wages\nNor heed my craft or art.\n\nEthna Carbery (1866-1911) was a wonderful Irish poet who is either under-appreciated or under-known today ...\n\nThe Love-Talker \nby Ethan Carbery\n\nI met the Love-Talker one eve in the glen,\nHe was handsomer than any of our handsome young men,\nHis eyes were blacker than the sloe, his voice sweeter far\nThan the crooning of old Kevins pipes beyond in Coolnagar.\n\nI was bound for the milking with a heart fair and free\nMy grief! my grief! that bitter hour drained the life from me;\nI thought him human lover, though his lips on mine were cold,\nAnd the breath of death blew keen on me within his hold.\n\nI know not what way he came, no shadow fell behind,\nBut all the sighing rushes swayed beneath a fairy wind;\nThe thrush ceased its singing, a mist crept about,\nWe two clung togetherwith the world shut out.\n\nBeyond the ghostly mist I could hear my cattle low,\nThe little cow from Ballina, clean as driven snow,\nThe dun cow from Kerry, the roan from Inisheer,\nOh, pitiful their callingand his whispers in my ear!\n\nHis eyes were a fire; his words were a snare;\nI cried my mothers name, but no help was there;\nI made the blessed Sign: then he gave a dreary moan,\nA wisp of cloud went floating by, and I stood alone.\n\nRunning ever thro my head is an old-time rune\nWho meets the Love-Talker must weave her shroud soon.\nMy mothers face is furrowed with the salt tears that fall,\nBut the kind eyes of my father are the saddest sight of all.\n\nI have spun the fleecy lint and now my wheel is still,\nThe linen length is woven for my shroud fine and chill,\nI shall stretch me on the bed, where a happy maid I lay\nPray for the soul of M\xe1ire Og at dawning of the day!\n\nLouis MacNeice (1907-1963) was an Irish poet and playwright of considerable skill, as his best-known poem, Bagpipe Music, superbly \nattests ...\n\nBagpipe Music\nby Louis MacNeice\n\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the peepshow.\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes are made of python,\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls with head of bison.\n\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\n\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a taxi.\n\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the heather,\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the puncture.\n\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was sober,\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one foot over.\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with repulsion,\nSaid to the midwife Take it away; I\'m through with overproduction.\n\nIt\'s no go the gossip column, it\'s no go the Ceilidh,\nAll we want is a mother\'s help and a sugar-stick for the baby.\n\nWillie Murray cut his thumb, couldn\'t count the damage,\nTook the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a bandage.\nHis brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,\nThrew the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the parish.\n\nIt\'s no go the Herring Board, it\'s no go the Bible,\nAll we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.\n\nIt\'s no go the picture palace, it\'s no go the stadium,\nIt\'s no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,\nIt\'s no go the Government grants, it\'s no go the elections,\nSit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a pension.\n\nIt\'s no go my honey love, it\'s no go my poppet;\nWork your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the profit.\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall forever,\nBut if you break the bloody glass you won\'t hold up the weather.\n\nHere\'s another loose translation of mine, this one of a poem written in Scots by Hugh MacDiarmid. A watergaw is a fragmentary \nrainbow ...\n\nThe Watergaw\nby Hugh MacDiarmid\nloose translation by  Michael R. Burch\n\nOne wet forenight in the sheep-shearing season\nI saw the uncanniest thing\na watergaw with its wavering light\nshining beyond the wild downpour of rain\nand I thought of the last, wild look that you gave\nwhen you knew you destined for the grave.\n\nThere was no light in the skylark\'s nest\nthat nightnonor any in mine;\nbut now often I\'ve thought of that foolish light\nand of these strange, foolish hearts of men\nand I think that, perhaps, at last I ken\nwhat your look meant then.\n\nSeamus Cassidy is a contemporary American poet of Irish extraction who often writes on Irish/Gaelic themes ...\n\nTaste of that Salt Breath\nby Seamus Cassidy\n\n(Reflections on a verse by W. B. Yeats)\n\nSo, I\'ll take my watercolors\nand go to where the rocks\nreach out like Celtic hands\njust in from the fields,\nspread for the surging sea\'s cleansing.\n\nThere on promontories that jut out\nto where the starving have all gone,\nI sit and stare inhaling salt breath\nyour incoming tide exhales\nupon these stones.\n\nI want to taste the salt of seas\ninvading redhaired Vikings smelled,\nremembering as they leaned back\nto watch our green shores fade,\nlonged to return and learned to love our land,\nthen stayed to give birth\nto all my wife and children\'s fierce red fire.\n\nNow, upon my own head that bonfire\nhas retired to ash\nwhere white-caps top me,\nand I wave toward heaven\nwondering when and why I\'ve come today.\n\nOh,  I\'ll sit and paint on this stillpoint;\nlet waves outside me crash\nand send their white-churning\nto bound against the boulders\nthat fill my breathing chest.\n\nI am of Scottish ancestry, as my last name attests. The poem below has a Scottish flavor and is an elegy of sorts dedicated to Harold Bloom, a \nprominent American critic who has called poetry America\'s elitist art ...\n\nCome Down\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Harold Bloom\n\nCome down, O, come down\nfrom your high mountain tower.\nHow coldly the wind blows,\nhow late this chill hour.\nAnd I cannot wait\nfor a meteor shower\nto show you the time\nmust be now, or not ever.\n\nCome down, O, come down\nfrom the high mountain heather\nnow brittle and brown\ndun corpse in white feather.\nCome down, or your heart\nwill grow cold as the weather\nwhen winter devours\nand spring returns never.\n\nIn conclusion ... there is no conclusion. English is a global language, with billions of people speaking it as either a first or second \nlanguage. The language and the art continue to evolve, together. Even post-modern free verse we can still hear echoes of earlier times and \npoems. The best poems of the past still remain viable, although sometimes we need skillful translators to make ancient poems like \nBeowulf accessible to our modern ears. A poem like Wulf and Eadwacer may change a bit with each retelling, but still \nenough of the original flavor remains to remind us of its deep roots in the English poetic tradition. In the end, what matters most is that \nreaders continue to read, enjoy and learn from the best writers of every age. Hopefully, if nothing else, this page brought poems to your \nattention that gave you pleasure and perhaps opened your eyes and ears to the endlessly inviting poetry of the past, which continues to \ncontribute to our constantly-evolving present and future.
