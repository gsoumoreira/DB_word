Burch, or, How the Hell Did I End Up Translating Other People\'s Poetry?\r\n\r\nThis page includes modern English translations of: Old English/Anglo-Saxon poems; Middle English \r\npoems by Geoffrey Chaucer, William Dunbar, Charles D\'Orleans and Layamon; ancient Greek epigrams, epitaphs and lyric poems by \r\nSappho, Simonides, Sophocles, Plato, and other poets; Latin epigrams by Martial, Seneca and \r\nThomas Campion; an ancient Egyptian love poem; an ancient Norse poem; \r\nhaiku and tanka by Basho and other Oriental Masters; Native American poems and \r\nproverbs; Holocaust poems by Paul \r\nCelan, Primo Levi, Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti, Wladyslaw Szlengel and Ko Un; a Hiroshima \r\npoem by Kurihara Sadako; Arabic and Palestinian poems; German poems by Bertolt \r\nBrecht and Rainer Maria Rilke; \r\nSpanish poems by Pablo Neruda; Russian poems by Marina Tsvetaeva; Chinese poems by Li Qingzhao; \r\nFrench poems by Charles Baudelaire, Veronica Franco, Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine; and Urdu poems by by \r\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz, Mirza Ghalib and Allama Iqbl.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I call my translations loose translations and \r\ninterpretations because they are not literal word-for-word translations. \r\nI begin with my personal interpretation of a poem and \r\ntranslate accordingly. To critics who object to variations from the original \r\ntexts, my response is that there are often substantial disagreements among even \r\nthe most accomplished translators. Variations begin with the \r\nreadings because different people receive different things from \r\ndifferent poems. And a strict word-for-word translation will seldom, if ever, \r\nresult in poetry. In my opinion translation is much closer to an art than a \r\nperfect science and I side with Rabindranath Tagore, who said he needed some \r\nleeway in order to produce poetry in another language when he translated his \r\nHindi poems into English.MRB\r\n\r\nSpeechless\r\nby Ko Un\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAt Auschwitz\r\npiles of glasses,\r\nmountains of shoes ...\r\nreturning, we stared out different windows.\r\n\r\nCherokee Travelers\' Blessing I\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI will extract the thorns from your feet.\r\nYet a little longer we will walk life\'s sunlit paths together.\r\nI will love you like my own brother, my own blood.\r\nWhen you are disconsolate, I will wipe the tears from your eyes.\r\nAnd when you are too sad to live, I will put your aching heart to rest.\r\n\r\nWhen my father chose to end his life by forgoing dialysis, I chose to translate \r\nNative American travelers\' blessings, prayers and proverbs that I found \r\ncomforting and hoped he might as well. You can find the collection here:\r\nNative American \r\nPoems, Prayers and Proverbs.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The next poet, Bertolt Brecht, fled Nazi Germany along with Albert \r\nEinstein, Thomas Mann and many other German intellectuals. So he was writing \r\nfrom bitter real-life experience.\r\n\r\nThe Burning of the Books\r\nby Bertolt Brecht\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhen the Regime\r\ncommanded the unlawful books to be burned,\r\nteams of dull oxen hauled huge cartloads to the bonfires.\r\n\r\nThen a banished writer, one of the best,\r\nscanning the list of excommunicated texts,\r\nbecame enraged  hed been excluded!\r\n\r\nHe rushed to his desk, full of contemptuous wrath,\r\nto write fiery letters to the incompetents in power \r\nBurn me! he wrote with his blazing pen \r\nHavent I always reported the truth?\r\nNow here you are, treating me like a liar!\r\nBurn me!\r\n\r\nParting\r\nby Bertolt Brecht\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe embrace;\r\nmy fingers trace\r\nrich cloth\r\nwhile yours encounter only moth-\r\neaten fabric.\r\nA quick hug:\r\nyou were invited to the gay soiree\r\nwhile the minions of the law relentlessly pursue me.\r\nWe talk about the weather\r\nand our eternal friendship\'s magic.\r\nAnything else would be too bitter,\r\ntoo tragic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mask of Evil\r\nby Bertolt Brecht\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA Japanese carving hangs on my wall \r\nthe mask of an ancient demon, limned with golden lacquer.\r\nNot altogether unsympathetically, I observe\r\nthe bulging veins of its forehead, noting\r\nthe grotesque effort it takes to be evil.\r\n\r\nRadio Poem\r\nby Bertolt Brecht\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou, little box, held tightly\r\nto me,\r\nescaping,\r\nso that your delicate tubes do not break;\r\ncarried from house to house, from ship to train,\r\nso that my enemies may continue communicating with me\r\non land and at sea\r\nand even in my bed, to my pain;\r\nthe last thing I hear at night, the first when I awake,\r\nrecounting their many conquests and my litany of cares,\r\npromise me not to go silent all of a sudden,\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing I was damn sure I\'d never do, it was translate poetry. Writing original poetry in one\'s native tongue is hard \r\nenough; only a masochist would try to translate someone else\'s poetry into other languages. And I sure as hell never \r\ndreamed \r\nof translating Anglo-Saxon or Ye Olde Englishe poems into modern English, \r\nbecause I had always found high-school- and college-enforced readings of lengthy \r\nBeowulf and Chaucer passages beyond tedious. But something made me change my \r\nmind: the stunning lyric poem immediately below. I fell in love with it, but I \r\ndidn\'t really care for any of the translations I was able to find ... hence \r\nI was forced to attempt the impossible, or, the highly \r\nimplausible ...\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (Old English circa 960-990 AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy people pursue him like crippled prey.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different!\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere, bloodthirsty curs roam this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different!\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained, as I wept,\r\nthe bold warrior came; he took me in his arms:\r\ngood feelings for him, but their end loathsome!\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat!\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? Watchdog!\r\nA wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nWhat an earthy, dirty, brutally honest poem written from a female perspective about \r\nwhat sounds like war, a family being split apart, and perhaps rape, sex slavery \r\nand child abduction and/or infanticide. Much remains in doubt: did Wulf abduct \r\nthe child, perhaps thinking the child was his, or did the the mother, the rapist or perhaps the rapist\'s \r\nwife get rid of the child? In my opinion the original poem is one of the truly \r\ngreat poems in the English language, so my translation seems like a worthwhile \r\nendeavor, especially if other people like what I\'ve done.\r\n\r\nThere was another \r\npoem that also vexed me because I didn\'t really care for the translations of it \r\nthat I had read, and it was perhaps the first poem to be written in the \r\nthen-fledgling English language:\r\n\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn (Old English circa 658-680 AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the Eternal Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the First Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, Holy Creator,\r\nMaker of mankind. Then he, the eternal Lord,\r\nafterwards made men middle-earth: Master almighty!\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD and may \r\nbe the oldest extant poem in the English language. According to the \r\nVenerable Bede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who was given the \r\ngift of poetic composition by an angel. In the original poem, hardly a word is \r\nrecognizable as English because C\xe6dmon was writing in a somewhat Anglicized form of \r\nancient German. The word England harkens back to Angle-land; the Angles were a \r\nGermanic tribe. Nevertheless, by C\xe6dmon\'s time the foundations of English poetry \r\nwere being laid, particularly in the areas of accentual meter and alliteration. \r\nPoets were considered to be Makers (as in William Dunbar\'s Lament for the \r\nMakaris), and poetry was considered to have a divine origin, so the poem may \r\nexpress a sort of affinity between the poet and his God.\r\n\r\nNow here are a series of splendid poems that may predate Chaucer. Please \r\nnote the introduction of end rhyme ...\r\n\r\nWestron Wynde (anonymous Middle English lyric, found in a partbook circa 1530 AD, \r\nbut perhaps written much earlier)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWestern wind, when will you blow,\r\nbringing the drizzling rain?\r\nChrist, that my love were in my arms,\r\nand I in my bed again!\r\n\r\nNOTE: The original poem has the smalle rayne down can rayne which suggests a drizzle or mist, either of which would suggest a dismal day.\r\n\r\nThis World\'s Joy(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa early 14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWinter awakens all my care\r\nas leafless trees grow bare.\r\nFor now my sighs are fraught\r\nwhenever it enters my thought:\r\nregarding this world\'s joy,\r\nhow everything comes to naught.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. 2253. f. 49r]\r\n\r\nWynter wakeneth al my care,\r\nNou this leves waxeth bare.\r\nOfte y sike ant mourne sare\r\nWhen hit cometh in my thoht\r\nOf this worldes joie, hou hit goth al to noht.\r\n\r\nPity Mary (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa early 13th \r\ncentury AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow the sun passes under the wood:\r\nI rue, Mary, thy facefair, good.\r\nNow the sun passes under the tree:\r\nI rue, Mary, thy son and thee.\r\n\r\nIn the poem above, note how wood and tree invoke the cross while sun and \r\nson seem to invoke each other. Sun-day is also Son-day, to Christians.The \r\nanonymous poet who wrote the poem above may have been been punning the \r\nwords sun and son. The poem is also known as Now Goeth \r\nSun Under Wood and Now Go\'th Sun Under Wood. Here\'s another poem from the same \r\nera:\r\n\r\nFowles in the Frith (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa \r\n13th-14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe fowls in the forest,\r\nthe fishes in the flood\r\nand I must go mad:\r\nsuch sorrow I\'ve had\r\nfor beasts of bone and blood!\r\n\r\nSounds like an early animal rights activist! The use of and is intriguing ... \r\nis the poet saying that his walks in the wood drive him mad because he is also a \r\nbeast of bone and blood, facing a similar fate?\r\n\r\nI am of Ireland (anonymous Medieval Irish lyric, circa \r\n13th-14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI am of Ireland,\r\nand of the holy realm of Ireland.\r\nGentlefolk, I pray thee:\r\nfor the sake of saintly charity,\r\ncome dance with me\r\nin Ireland!\r\n\r\nIch am of Irlaunde,\r\nAnt of the holy londe\r\nOf Irlande.\r\nGode sire, pray ich the,\r\nFor of saynte charit\xe9,\r\nCome ant daunce wyth me\r\nIn Irlaunde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poem above still smacks of German, with Ich for I. But a metamorphosis was \r\nclearly in progress: English poetry was evolving to employ meter and rhyme, as \r\nwell as Anglo-Saxon alliteration. And it\'s interesting to note that ballad, \r\nballet and ball all have the same root: the Latin ballare (to \r\ndance) and the Italian ballo/balleto (a dance). Think of a farm \r\ncommunity assembling for a hoe-down, then dancing a two-step to music with lyrics. \r\nThat is apparently how many early English poems originated. And the more regular \r\nmeter of the evolving poems would suit music well.\r\n\r\nHow Long the Night (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa early 13th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant, indeed, while the summer lasts\r\nwith the mild pheasants\' song ...\r\nbut now I feel the northern wind\'s blast\r\nits severe weather strong.\r\nAlas! Alas! This night seems so long!\r\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\r\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\r\n\r\nInfectious!\r\nby Hafiz aka Hafez\r\nloose translation/interpretation byMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI became infected with happiness tonight\r\nas I wandered idly, singing in the starlight.\r\nNow I\'m wonderfully contagious\r\nso kiss me!\r\n\r\nDispensing Keys\r\nby Hafiz aka Hafez\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages\r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head\r\nwhenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys\r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\n\r\nThe Tally\r\nby Hafiz aka Hafez\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLovers\r\ndon\'t reveal\r\nall\r\ntheir Secrets;\r\nunder the covers\r\nthey\r\nmay\r\ncount each other\'s Moles\r\n(that reside\r\nand hide\r\nin the shy regions\r\nby forbidden holes),\r\nthen keep the final tally\r\nstrictly\r\nfrom Aunt Sally!\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly a very loose translation of the original Hafiz poem!\r\n\r\nNOVELTIES\r\nby Thomas Campion\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBooksellers laud authors for novel editions\r\nas pimps praise their whores for exotic positions.\r\n\r\nOriginal Latin epigram:\r\n\r\nIN LIBRARIOS\r\nby Thomas Campion\r\n\r\nImpressionum plurium librum laudat\r\nLibrarius; scortum nec non minus leno.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Rondels by Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nI. Merciles Beaute \r\n(Merciless Beauty)\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen.\r\nUnless your words heal me hastily,\r\nmy heart\'s wound will remain green;\r\nfor your eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain.\r\nBy all truth, I tell you faithfully\r\nthat you are of life and death my queen;\r\nfor at my death this truth shall be seen:\r\nyour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen.\r\nOriginal text:\r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly,\r\nI may the beaute of hem not sustene,\r\nSo woundeth hit through-out my herte kene.\r\nAnd but your word wol helen hastily\r\nMy hertes wounde, whyl that hit is grene,\r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly;\r\nmay the beaute of hem not sustene.\r\nUpon my trouthe I sey yow feithfully,\r\nThat ye ben of my lyf and deth the quene;\r\nFor with my deth the trouthe shal be sene.\r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly,\r\nI may the beaute of hem not sustene,\r\nSo woundeth hit through-out my herte kene.\r\n\r\nII. Rejection\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain.\r\nI\'m guiltless, yet my sentence has been cast.\r\nI tell you truly, needless now to feign,\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain.\r\nAlas, that Nature in your face compassed\r\nSuch beauty, that no man may hope attain\r\nTo mercy, though he perish from the pain;\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain.\r\nOriginal text:\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herte chaced\r\nPitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;\r\nFor Daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.\r\nGiltles my deth thus han ye me purchaced;\r\nI sey yow soth, me nedeth not to feyne;\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herle chaced\r\nPilee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne\r\nAllas! that nature hath in yow compassed\r\nSo gret beaute, that no man may atteyne\r\nTo mercy, though he sterve for the peyne.\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herte chaced\r\nPitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;\r\nFor daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.\r\n\r\nIII. Escape\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean.\r\nHe may question me and counter this and that;\r\nI care not: I will answer just as I mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean.\r\nLove strikes me from his roster, short and flat,\r\nAnd he is struck from my books, just as clean,\r\nForevermore; there is no other mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean.\r\n\r\nOriginal text:\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene;\r\nSin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.\r\nHe may answere, and seye this or that;\r\nI do no fors, I speke right as I mene.\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene.\r\nLove hath my name y-strike out of his sclat,\r\nAnd he is strike out of my bokes clene\r\nFor ever-mo; [ther] is non other mene.\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene;\r\nSin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.\r\nExplicit.\r\n\r\nRondel: Your Smiling Mouth\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains,\r\nYour hands so smooth, each finger straight and plain,\r\nYour little feetplease, what more can I say?\r\n\r\nIt is my fetish when youre far away\r\nTo muse on these and thus to soothe my pain\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains.\r\n\r\nSo would I beg you, if I only may,\r\nTo see such sights as I before have seen,\r\nBecause my fetish pleases me. Obscene?\r\nIll be obsessed until my dying day\r\nBy your sweet smiling mouth and eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains!\r\nSpring\r\nby Charles dOrleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\nYoung lovers,\r\ngreeting the spring\r\nfling themselves downhill,\r\nmaking cobblestones ring\r\nwith their wild leaps and arcs,\r\nlike ecstatic sparks\r\nstruck from coal.\r\nWhat is their brazen goal?\r\n\r\nThey grab at whatever passes,\r\nso we can only hazard guesses.\r\nBut they rear like prancing steeds\r\nraked by brilliant spurs of need,\r\nYoung lovers.\r\nThe original French poem:\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx\r\nEn la nouvelle saison,\r\nPar les rues, sans raison,\r\nChevauchent, faisans les saulx.\r\nEt font saillir des carreaulx\r\nLe feu, comme de cherbon,\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx.\r\nJe ne s\xe7ay se leurs travaulx\r\nIlz emploient bien ou non,\r\nMais piqu\xe9s de lesperon\r\nSont autant que leurs chevaulx\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx.\r\n\r\nOft in My Thought\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\r\n Around the advent of the fledgling year,\r\nFor something pretty that I really ought\r\n To give my lady dear;\r\n But that sweet thought\'s been wrested from me, clear,\r\n Since death, alas, has sealed her under clay\r\n And robbed the world of all that\'s precious here\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\r\n Acceptable, as suits my age\'s hour?\r\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\r\n Her worth? It tests my power!\r\n I serve her now with masses and with prayer;\r\n For it would be a shame for me to stray\r\n Far from my faith, when my time\'s drawing near\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\r\n And the cost of everything became so dear;\r\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\r\n Take my good deeds, as many as there are,\r\n And crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\r\n As heaven\'s truest maid! And may I \r\nsay:\r\n Most good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\r\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\r\n Then my heart floods like an overflowing bay\r\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nof wind and cold and chilling rain\r\nto dress in embroidered light again:\r\nthe light of daybright, festive, gay!\r\nEach bird and beast, without delay,\r\nin its own tongue, sings this refrain:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away!\r\nBrooks, fountains, rivers, streams at play,\r\nwear, with their summer livery,\r\nbright beads of silver jewelry.\r\nAll the Earth has a new and fresh display:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away!\r\nNote: This rondeau was set to music by Debussy in his Trois chansons de \r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nby Charles dOrleans (1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nof wind, chill rain and bitter air,\r\nand now goes clad in clothes of gold\r\nof smiling suns and seasons fair,\r\nwhile birds and beasts of wood and fold\r\nnow with each cry and song declare:\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold!\r\nAll brooks, springs, rivers, seaward rolled,\r\nnow pleasant summer livery wear\r\nwith silver beads embroidered where\r\nthe world puts off its raiment old.\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold.\r\n\r\nSumer is icumen in\r\na modern English translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSumer is icumen in\r\nLhude sing achu!\r\nGroweth sed\r\nAnd bloweth hed\r\nAnd buyeth med?\r\nCuccu!\r\n\r\nI Loved You\r\nby Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI loved you ... perhaps I love you still ...\r\nperhaps for a while such emotions may remain.\r\nBut please dont let my feelings trouble you;\r\nI do not wish to cause you further pain.\r\nI loved you ... thus the hopelessness I knew ...\r\nThe jealousy, the diffidence, the pain\r\nresulted in two hearts so wholly true\r\nthe gods might grant us leave to love again.\r\n\r\nLes Bijoux (The Jewels)\r\nby Charles Baudelaire\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy lover nude and knowing my heart\'s whims\r\nWore nothing more than a few bright-flashing gems;\r\nHer art was saving men despite their sins\r\nShe ruled like harem girls crowned with diadems!\r\n\r\nShe danced for me with a gay but mocking air,\r\nMy world of stone and metal sparking bright;\r\nI discovered in her the rapture of everything fair\r\nNay, an excess of joy where the spirit and flesh unite!\r\n\r\nNaked she lay and offered herself to me,\r\nParting her legs and smiling receptively,\r\nAs gentle and yet profound as the rising sea\r\nTill her surging tide encountered my cliff, abruptly.\r\n\r\nA tigress tamed, her eyes met mine, intent ...\r\nIntent on lust, content to purr and please!\r\nHer breath, both languid and lascivious, lent\r\nAn odd charm to her metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nHer limbs, her loins, her abdomen, her thighs,\r\nOiled alabaster, sinuous as a swan,\r\nWrithed pale before my calm clairvoyant eyes;\r\nLike clustered grapes her breasts and belly shone.\r\n\r\nSkilled in more spells than evil imps can muster,\r\nTo break the peace which had possessed my heart,\r\nShe flashed her crystal rocks hypnotic luster\r\nTill my quietude was shattered, blown apart.\r\n\r\nHer waist awrithe, her breasts enormously\r\nOut-thrust, and yet ... and yet, somehow, still coy ...\r\nAs if stout haunches of Antiope\r\nHad been grafted to a boy ...\r\n\r\nThe room grew dark, the lamp had flickered out.\r\nMute firelight, alone, lit each glowing stud;\r\nEach time the fire sighed, as if in doubt,\r\nIt steeped her pale, rouged flesh in pools of blood.\r\nIl pleure dans mon coeur (It rains in my heart)\r\nby Paul Verlaine\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

She had 79 poems in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand \r\nLeaves), the first major anthology of classical Japanese poetry, mostly waka. \r\nThe compiler of the anthology was Otomo no Yakamochi (c. 718-785). Otomo no \r\nSakanoue no Iratsume was his aunt, tutor and poetic mentor. In the first stanza, \r\nLady Otomo has left her children in Nara, possibly to visit her brother. In the \r\nsecond stanza, it is believed that the jewel is Lady Otomo\'s daughter and that \r\nshe has been trusted to the care of her husband. As for the closing stanza, \r\naccording to the notes of the Manyoshu, it was popularly believed that \r\na person would appear in the dreams of the one for whom he/she yearned.\r\n\r\nYou cancrop all the flowersbutyou cannot detain spring.Pablo \r\nNeruda, translation by Michael R.

Joy! Joy!\r\nAs only dogs experience joy\r\nin the shameless exuberance\r\nof their guiltless spirits.\r\nThus there are no sad good-byes\r\nfor my dog who died;\r\nwe never once lied to each other.\r\nHe died, he\'s gone, I buried him;\r\nthat\'s all there is to it.\r\nTonight I will write the saddest lines\r\nby Pablo Neruda\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

She will soon be anothers.\r\nHer body, her voice, her infinite eyes.\r\nI no longer love her! And why should I love her\r\nwhen love is sad, short, mad, fickle, unwise?\r\nBecause of cold nights we clung through so closely,\r\nIm not satisfied to know she is gone.\r\nAnd while I must end this hell I now suffer,\r\nIts sad to remember all love left undone.\r\n\r\nAdvice to Young Poets\r\nby Nicanor Parra Sandoval\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Sweet Rose of Virtue has been one of my favorite poems \r\nsince I first read it.

Burch\r\n\r\nNow he stands on a hill overlooking the Avon,\r\nseeing steel fishes girded with swords in the stream,\r\ntheir swimming days done,\r\ntheir scales a-gleam like gold-plated shields,\r\ntheir fish-spines floating like shattered spears.\r\n\r\nLayamon\'s Brut is a 32,000-line poem composed \r\nin Middle English that shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence and contains the \r\nfirst known reference to King Arthur in English. The passage above is a good \r\nexample of Layamon\'s gift for imagery. It\'s interesting, I think, that a \r\nthousand years ago a poet was dabbling in surrealism, with dead warriors being \r\ndescribed as if they were both men and fish.\r\n\r\nAround the same time that I was finding myself frustrated with other people\'s \r\ntranslations of the poems above, I also discovered certain Greek epigrams that  \r\nseemed to deserve more attention. So I created a collection of English \r\nepigrams modeled after epitaphs gleaned from ancient Greek gravestones and \r\ncalled the collection:\r\n\r\nAthenian Epitaphs\r\n\r\n\r\nMariner, do not question whose tomb this may be,\r\nBut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\nMichael R.

Burch, \r\nafter Anacreon\r\n\r\nBlame not the gale, nor the inhospitable sea-gulf, nor friends tardiness,\r\nMariner! Just mans foolhardiness.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Leonidas of Tarentum\r\n\r\nNow that I am dead sea-enclosed Cyzicus shrouds my bones.\r\nFaretheewell, O my adoptive land that nurtured me, that suckled me;\r\nI take rest at your breast.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Erycius\r\n\r\nStripped of her stripling, if asked, shed confess:\r\nI am now less than nothingness.\r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Diotimus\r\n\r\nIf you liked these modernizations of ancient Greek epigrams, there are more at \r\nthe bottom of this page. Now here are three of my translations of the epigrams \r\nof Sappho, one of the first great lyric poets, and perhaps the first great \r\nfemale poet whose name we know today:\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 155\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA short transparent frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 130\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMay the gods prolong the night\r\nyes, let it last forever!\r\nas long as you sleep in my sight.\r\n\r\nHaiku can be similar to the best Greek epigrams: short and sweet, or (more often) \r\nshort and bittersweet. Here\'s my translation of one of my favorite haiku, by the \r\nmaster Basho:\r\n\r\nThe butterfly\r\nperfuming its wings\r\nfans the orchid\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael \r\nR. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s another haiku I particularly love:\r\n\r\nOh, fallen camellias,\r\nif I were you,\r\nI\'d leap into the torrent! \r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose \r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere is my only translation of a tanka (at least to date). Again I am struck by the similarity of great \r\nOriental poetry to the best ancient Greek epigrams:\r\n\r\nOur life here on earth:\r\nto what shall we compare it?\r\nIt is not like a rowboat\r\ndeparting at daybreak,\r\nleaving no trace of man in its wake?\r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere are more of my haiku translations; every other poem is by the Master Basho; \r\nI consider him one of the greatest poets of all time, in any language:\r\n\r\nDeep autumn:\r\nmy neighbor,\r\nhow does he continue, I wonder ...\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOne apple, alone\r\nIn the abandoned orchard\r\nreddens for winter\r\n Patrick Blanche, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nCome, investigate loneliness!\r\na solitary leaf\r\nclings to the Kiri tree\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA kite floats\r\nat the same place in the sky\r\nwhere yesterday it floated ...\r\n Buson Yosa, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLet us arrange\r\nthese lovely flowers in the bowl\r\nsince there\'s no rice\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nGrasses wilt:\r\nthe braking locomotive\r\ngrinds to a halt\r\n Yamaguchi Seishi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn ancient pond,\r\nthe frog leaps:\r\nthe silver plop and gurgle of water\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWild geese pass\r\nleaving the emptiness of heaven\r\nrevealed\r\n Takaha Shugyo, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe first soft snow:\r\nleaves of the awed jonquil\r\nbow low\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI shattered your heart;\r\nnow I limp through the shards\r\nbarefoot.\r\n\r\nby Vera Pavlova, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe last poem above is by a contemporary Russian poet, but I think it rivals the work of the Oriental masters. There are more haiku translations toward the end of this page. The Romans also wrote epigrams ...\r\n\r\nJust as I select a ship when it\'s time to travel,\r\nor a house when it\'s time to change residences,\r\neven so I will choose when it\'s time to depart from life.\r\nSeneca (5 BC - 65 AD), speaking about the right to euthanasia in the first century AD, \r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThrough the fields of solitude\r\nby Hermann Allmers\r\ntranslation by \r\nDavid B. Gosselin \r\nwith Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPeacefully, I rest in the tall green grass\r\nFor a long time only gazing as I lie,\r\nCaught in the endless hymn of crickets,\r\nAnd encircled by a wonderful blue sky.\r\n\r\nAnd the lovely white clouds floating across\r\nThe depths of the heavens are like silky lace;\r\nI feel as though I have long been dead,\r\nSoftly drifting with them through eternal space.\r\n\r\nWalid Khazindar was born in 1950 in Gaza City. He is considered to be one of the very best Palestinian poets; his poetry has been said to be characterized by metaphoric originality and a novel thematic approach \r\nunprecedented in Arabic poetry. He was awarded the first Palestine Prize for Poetry in 1997.\r\n\r\nThis Distant Light\r\n\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBitterly cold,\r\nwinter clings to the naked trees.\r\n\r\nIf only you would free\r\nthe bright sparrows\r\nfrom your fingertips\r\nand unleash a smilethat shy, tentative smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned anguish I see.\r\n\r\nSing! Can we not sing\r\nas if we were warm, hand-in-hand,\r\nsheltered by shade from a sweltering sun?\r\n\r\nCan you not always remain like this:\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than expected, in reverie?\r\n\r\nDarkness increases and we must remain vigilant\r\nnow that this distant light is our sole consolation ...\r\nthis imperiled flame, which from the beginning\r\nhas constantly flickered,\r\nin danger of going out.\r\n\r\nCome to me, closer and closer.\r\nI dont want to be able to tell my hand from yours.\r\nAnd lets stay awake, lest the snow smother us.\r\n\r\nThese are my translations of poems by the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke:\r\n\r\nArchaischer Torso Apollos (Archaic Torso of Apollo)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe cannot know the beheaded god\r\nnor his eyes\' forfeited visions. But still\r\nthe figure\'s trunk glows with the strange vitality\r\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\r\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\r\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\r\nnor the centering loins make us smile\r\nat the thought of their generative animus.\r\nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\r\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\r\nprojecting procreation\'s triangular spearhead upwards,\r\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\r\nlike an inchoate stardemanding our belief.\r\nYou must change your life.\r\n\r\nDer Panther (The Panther)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHis weary vision\'s so overwhelmed by iron bars,\r\nhis exhausted eyes see only blank Oblivion.\r\nHis world is not our world. It has no stars.\r\nNo light. Ten thousand bars. Nothing beyond.\r\nLithe, swinging with a rhythmic easy stride,\r\nhe circles, his small orbit tightening,\r\nan electron losing power. Paralyzed,\r\nsoon regal Will stands stunned, an abject thing.\r\nOnly at times the pupils\' curtains rise\r\nsilently, and then an image enters,\r\ndescends through arrested shoulders, plunges, centers\r\nsomewhere within his empty heart, and dies.\r\n\r\nHerbsttag (Autumn Day)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLord, it is time. Let the immense summer go.\r\nLay your long shadows over the sundials\r\nand over the meadows, let the free winds blow.\r\nCommand the late fruits to fatten and shine;\r\nO, grant them another Mediterranean hour!\r\nUrge them to completion, and with power\r\nconvey final sweetness to the heavy wine.\r\nWho has no house now, never will build one.\r\nWho\'s alone now, shall continue alone;\r\nhe\'ll wake, read, write long letters to friends,\r\nand pace the tree-lined pathways up and down,\r\nrestlessly, as autumn leaves drift and descend.\r\nKomm, Du (Come, You)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThis was Rilkes last poem, written ten days before his death. He died \r\nopen-eyed in the arms of his doctor on December 29, 1926, in the Valmont \r\nSanatorium, of leukemia and its complications. I had a friend who died of \r\nleukemia and he was burning up with fever in the end. I believe that is what \r\nRilke was describing here: he was literally burning alive.\r\nCome, youthe last one I acknowledge; return\r\nincurable pain searing this physical mesh.\r\nAs I burned in the spirit once, so now I burn\r\nwith you; meanwhile, you consume my flesh.\r\nThis wood that long resisted your embrace\r\nnow nourishes you; I surrender to your fury\r\nas my gentleness mutates to hellish rage\r\nuncaged, wild, primal, mindless, outr\xe9.\r\nCompletely free, no longer futures pawn,\r\nI clambered up this crazy pyre of pain,\r\ncertain Id never returnmy hearts reserves gone\r\nto become deaths nameless victim, purged by flame.\r\nNow all I ever was must be denied.\r\nI left my memories of my past elsewhere.\r\nThat lifemy former liferemains outside.\r\nInside, Im lost. Nobody knows me here.\r\nLiebes-Lied (Love Song)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nHow can I withhold my soul so that it doesnt touch yours?\r\nHow can I lift mine gently to higher things, alone?\r\nOh, I would gladly find something lost in the dark\r\nin that inert space that fails to resonate until you vibrate.\r\nThere everything that moves us, draws us together like a bow\r\nenticing two taut strings to sing together with a simultaneous voice.\r\nWhose instrument are we becoming together?\r\nWhose, the hands that excite us?\r\nAh, sweet song!\r\n\r\nDas Lied des Bettlers (The Beggars Song)\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI live outside your gates,\r\nexposed to the rain, exposed to the sun;\r\nsometimes Ill cradle my right ear\r\nin my right palm;\r\nthen when I speak my voice sounds strange,\r\nalien ...\r\nI\'m unsure whose voice Im hearing:\r\nmine or yours.\r\nI implore a trifle;\r\nthe poets cry for more.\r\nSometimes I cover both eyes\r\nand my face disappears;\r\nthere it lies heavy in my hands\r\nlooking peaceful, instead,\r\nso that no one would ever think\r\nI have no place to lay my head.\r\n\r\nHere are my translations of four poems by the great Holocaust poet Mikl\xf3s \r\nRadn\xf3ti. They were written on what became his death march as Nazi soldiers \r\nherded Jewish concentration camp prisoners away from the advancing Russian \r\narmies.\r\n\r\nPostcard 1\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOut of Bulgaria, the great wild roar of the artillery thunders,\r\nresounds on the mountain ridges, rebounds, then ebbs into silence\r\nwhile here men, beasts, wagons and imagination all steadily increase;\r\nthe road whinnies and bucks, neighing; the maned sky gallops;\r\nand you are eternally with me, love, constant amid all the chaos,\r\nglowing within my conscience  incandescent, intense.\r\nSomewhere within me, dear, you abide forever \r\nstill, motionless, mute, like an angel stunned to silence by death\r\nor a beetle hiding in the heart of a rotting tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostcard 2\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA few miles away they\'re incinerating\r\nthe haystacks and the houses,\r\nwhile squatting here on the fringe of this pleasant meadow,\r\nthe shell-shocked peasants quietly smoke their pipes.\r\nNow, here, stepping into this still pond, the little shepherd girl\r\nsets the silver water a-ripple\r\nwhile, leaning over to drink, her flocculent sheep\r\nseem to swim like drifting clouds.\r\n\r\nPostcard 3\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe oxen dribble bloody spittle;\r\nthe\r\nmen pass blood in their piss.\r\nOur stinking regiment halts, a horde of perspiring savages,\r\nadding our aroma to death\'s repulsive stench.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostcard 4\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI toppled beside him  his body already taut,\r\ntight as a string just before it snaps,\r\nshot in the back of the head.\r\n"This is how youll end too; just lie quietly here,"\r\nI whispered to myself, patience blossoming from dread.\r\n"Der springt noch auf, the voice above me jeered;\r\nI could only dimly hear\r\nthrough the congealing blood slowly sealing my ear.\r\n\r\nThis was his final poem, written October 31, 1944 near Szentkir\xe1lyszabadja, Hungary.\r\n"Der springt noch auf" means something like "That one is still twitching."\r\n\r\nHere\'s my translation of a moving poem by Hiroshima survivor Kurihara Sadako:\r\n\r\nLet Us Be Midwives!\r\nby Kurihara Sadako\r\nloose translation/interpretation by\r\n\t  Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\n5\r\nAbove the city Saint Peter once remanded to hell\r\nnow rolls the delirious thunder of the bells.\r\n\r\nAs the thundering high tide eventually reverses,\r\nso, too, the woman who once bore your curses.\r\n\r\nTo you, O Great Peter, and you, O Great Tsar, I kneel!\r\nAnd yet the bells above me continually peal.\r\n\r\nAnd while they keep ringing out of the pure blue sky,\r\nMoscow\'s eminence is something I can\'t deny ...\r\n\r\nthough sixteen hundred churches, nearby and afar,\r\nall gaily laugh at the hubris of the Tsars.\r\nUndine\r\nby Ren\xe9e Vivien\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Kim Cherub\r\nYour laughter startles, your caresses rake.\r\nYour cold kisses love the evil they do.\r\nYour eyesblue lotuses drifting on a lake.\r\nLilies are less pallid than your face.\r\nYou move like water parting.\r\nYour hair falls in rootlike tangles.\r\nYour words like treacherous rapids rise.\r\nYour arms, flexible as reeds, strangle,\r\nChoking me like tubular river reeds.\r\nI shiver in their enlacing embrace.\r\nDrowning without an illuminating moon,\r\nI vanish without a trace,\r\nlost in a nightly swoon.\r\nUndine\r\nTon rire est clair, ta caresse est profonde,\r\nTes froids baisers aiment le mal qu\'ils font;\r\nTes yeux sont bleus comme un lotus sur l\'onde,\r\nEt les lys d\'eau sont moins purs que ton front. \r\nTa forme fuit, ta d\xe9marche est fluide,\r\nEt tes cheveux sont de l\xe9gers roseaux ;\r\nTa voix ruisselle ainsi qu\'un flot perfide ;\r\nTes souples bras sont pareils aux roseaux, \r\nAux longs roseaux des fleuves, dont l\'\xe9treinte\r\nEnlace, \xe9touffe, \xe9trangle savamment,\r\nAu fond des flots, une agonie \xe9teint\r\nDans un nocturne \xe9vanouissement. \r\n\r\nThe Seashore Gathering\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds, earth\'s children converge.\r\nThe infinite sky is motionless, the restless waters boisterous.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds earth\'s children gather to dance with joyous \r\ncries and pirouettes.\r\nThey build sand castles and play with hollow shells.\r\nThey weave boats out of withered leaves and laughingly float them out over the \r\nvast deep.\r\nEarth\'s children play gaily on the seashores of endless worlds.\r\nThey do not know, yet, how to cast nets or swim.\r\nDivers fish for pearls and merchants sail their ships, while earth\'s children \r\nskip, gather pebbles and scatter them again.\r\nThey are unaware of hidden treasures, nor do they know how to cast nets, yet.\r\nThe sea surges with laughter, smiling palely on the seashore.\r\nDeath-dealing waves sing the children meaningless songs, like a mother \r\nlullabying her baby\'s cradle.\r\nThe sea plays with the children, smiling palely on the seashore.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds earth\'s children meet.\r\nTempests roam pathless skies, ships lie wrecked in uncharted waters, death \r\nwanders abroad, and still the children play.\r\nOn the seashores of endless worlds there is a great gathering of earth\'s \r\nchildren.\r\nCome As You Are\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nIs your hair untamable, your part uneven, your bodice unfastened? Never mind.\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nSkip with quicksilver steps across the grass.\r\nIf your feet glisten with dew, if your anklets slip, if your beaded necklace \r\nslides off? Never mind.\r\nSkip with quicksilver steps across the grass.\r\nDo you see the clouds enveloping the sky?\r\nFlocks of cranes erupt from the riverbank, fitful gusts ruffle the fields, \r\nanxious cattle tremble in their stalls.\r\nDo you see the clouds enveloping the sky?\r\nYou loiter in vain over your toilet lamp; it flickers and dies in the wind.\r\nWho will care that your eyelids have not been painted with lamp-black, when your \r\npupils are darker than thunderstorms?\r\nYou loiter in vain over your toilet lamp; it flickers and dies in the wind.\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nIf the wreath lies unwoven, who cares? If the bracelet is unfastened, let it \r\nfall. The sky grows dark; it is late.\r\nCome as you are, forget appearances!\r\nUnfit Gifts\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nAt sunrise, I cast my nets into the sea,\r\ndredging up the strangest and most beautiful objects from the depths ...\r\nsome radiant like smiles, some glittering like tears, others flushed like \r\nbrides cheeks.\r\nWhen I returned, staggering under their weight, my love was relaxing in her \r\ngarden, idly tearing leaves from flowers.\r\nHesitant, I placed all I had produced at her feet, silently awaiting her \r\nverdict.\r\nShe glanced down disdainfully, then pouted: What are these bizarre things? I \r\nhave no use for them!\r\nI bowed my head, humiliated, and thought:\r\nTruly, I did not contend for them; I did not purchase them in the marketplace; \r\nthey are unfit gifts for her!\r\nThat night I flung them, one by one, into the street, like refuse.\r\nThe next morning travelers came, picked them up and carted them off to exotic \r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThis Dog\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEach morning this dog,\r\nwho has become quite attached to me,\r\nsits silently at my feet\r\nuntil, gently caressing his head,\r\nI acknowledge his company.\r\n\r\nThis simple recognition gives my companion such joy\r\nhe shudders with sheer delight.\r\n\r\nAmong all languageless creatures\r\nhe alone has seen through man entire\r\nhas seen beyond what is good or bad in him\r\nto such a depth he can lay down his life\r\nfor the sake of love alone.\r\n\r\nNow it is he who shows me the way\r\nthrough this unfathomable world throbbing with life.\r\n\r\nWhen I see his deep devotion,\r\nhis offer of his whole being,\r\nI fail to comprehend ...\r\n\r\nHow, through sheer instinct,\r\nhas he discovered whatever it is that he knows?\r\n\r\nWith his anxious piteous looks\r\nhe cannot communicate his understanding\r\nand yet somehow has succeeded in conveying to me\r\nout of the entire creation\r\nthe true loveworthiness of man.\r\nI Cannot Remember My Mother\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nI cannot remember my mother,\r\nyet sometimes in the middle of my playing\r\na melody seemed to hover over my playthings:\r\nsome forgotten tune she loved to sing\r\nwhile rocking my cradle.\r\nI cannot remember my mother,\r\nyet sometimes on an early autumn morning\r\nthe smell of the shiuli flowers fills my room\r\nas the scent of the temples morning service\r\nwafts over me like my mothers perfume.\r\nI cannot remember my mother,\r\nyet sometimes still, from my bedroom window,\r\nwhen I lift my eyes to the heavens vast blue canopy\r\nand sense on my face her serene gaze,\r\nI feel her grace has encompassed the sky.\r\n\r\nPatience\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIf you refuse to speak, I will fill my heart with your silence and endure it.\r\nI will remain still and wait like the night through its starry vigil\r\nwith its head bowed low in patience.\r\n\r\nThe morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish,\r\nand your voice will pour down in golden streams breaking through the heavens.\r\n\r\nThen your words will take wing in songs from each of my birds\' nests,\r\nand your melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.\r\n\r\nGitanjali 35\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high;\r\nWhere knowledge is free;\r\nWhere the world has not been divided by narrow domestic walls;\r\nWhere words emerge from the depths of truth;\r\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\r\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not been lost amid the dreary desert sands of dead habit;\r\nWhere the mind is led forward into ever-widening thought and action;\r\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\r\n\r\nGitanjali 11\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLeave this vain chanting and singing and counting of beads:\r\nwhat Entity do you seek in this lonely dark temple with all the doors \r\nshut?\r\nOpen your eyes and see: God is not here!\r\nHe is out there where the tiller tills the hard ground and the paver breaks stones.\r\n\r\nHe is with them in sun and shower; his garments are filthy with dust.\r\nShed your immaculate mantle and like him embrace the dust!\r\nDeliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found\r\nwhen our Master himself has joyfully embraced the bonds of creation; he is bound with \r\nus all forever!\r\nCease your meditations, abandon your petals and incense!\r\nWhat is the harm if your clothes become stained rags?\r\nMeet him in the toil and the sweat of his brow!\r\n\r\nLast Curtain\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI know the day comes when my eyes close,\r\nwhen my sight fails,\r\nwhen life takes its leave in silence\r\nand the last curtain veils my vision.\r\nYet the stars will still watch by night;\r\nthe sun will still rise like before;\r\nthe hours will still heave like sea waves\r\ncasting up pleasures and pains.\r\nWhen I consider this end of my earth-life,\r\nthe barrier of the moments breaks\r\nand I see by the illumination of death\r\nthis world with its careless treasures.\r\nRare is its lowliest seat,\r\nrare its meanest of lives.\r\nThings I longed for in vain and those I received, let them pass.\r\nLet me but truly possess the things I rejected and overlooked.\r\n\r\nDeath\r\nby Rabindranath Tagore\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou who are the final fulfillment of life,\r\nDeath, my Death, come and whisper to me!\r\nDay after day I have kept watch for you;\r\nfor you I have borne the joys and the pangs of life.\r\nAll that I am, all that I have and hope, and all my love\r\nhave always flowed toward you in the depths of secrecy.\r\nOne final glance from your eyes and my life will be yours forever, your own.\r\nThe flowers have been woven and the garland prepared for the bridegroom.\r\nAfter the wedding the bride must leave her home and meet her lord alone in the \r\nsolitude of night.\r\n\r\nWhile the following poem is not a translation, per se, it is my interpretation \r\nof another poet\'s idea, as explained after the poem ...\r\n\r\nThe Pain of Love\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nfor T. M. \r\nThe pain of love is this:\r\nthe parting after the kiss;\r\nthe train steaming from the station\r\nwhistling abnegation;\r\neach interstates bleak white bar\r\nthat vanishes under your car;\r\nevery hour and flower and friend\r\nthat cannot be saved in the end;\r\ndear things of immeasurable cost ...\r\nnow all irretrievably lost.\r\nThe title The Pain of Love was suggested by Little \r\nRichard, then eighty years old, in an interview with Rolling Stone. \r\nLittle Richard said someone should create a song called The Pain of Love. How \r\ncould I not obey a living legend? I have always found the departure platforms of \r\nrailway stations and the vanishing broken white bars of highway dividing lines \r\nto be depressing, so they were natural images for my poem.

Theyre full to overflowing, and all for you!\r\nI glory in the hours of our embracings;\r\nmy joy is incalculable!\r\nThe thrill of your love spreads through my body\r\nlike honey in water,\r\nlike a drug mixed with spices,\r\nlike wine mingled with water.\r\nOh, that you would speed to see your sister\r\nlike a stallion in heat, like a bull to his heifer!\r\nFor the heavens have granted us love like flames igniting straw,\r\ndesire like the falcons free-falling frenzy!\r\n\r\nVeronica Franco (1546-1591) was a Venetian courtesan who wrote literary-quality \r\npoetry and prose. Renaissance Venetian society recognized two very different \r\nclasses of courtesans: the cortigiana onesta (intellectual courtesans) \r\nand the cortigiana di lume (lower-class prostitutes, often \r\nstreetwalkers). Franco was perhaps the most celebrated cortigiana onesta, \r\nor honest courtesan. Thanks to her fine education and literary talents, she \r\nwas able to mingle with Venices elites, befriending and sometimes bedding \r\naristocrats and noblemen, even King Henry III of France, to whom she addressed \r\ntwo sonnets in her second book. She also became close friends with Domenico \r\nVenier, a patron of female poets, and was able to take advantage of the Venier \r\npalace library. Her poems display both passion and intelligence, and she \r\nsometimes engaged in witty poetic duels with the male poets she knew. For \r\ninstance, Franco wrote the poem below in response to a poem by Marco Venier: \r\n\r\nA Courtesan\'s Love Lyric (I)\r\nby Veronica Franco\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nMy rewards will be commensurate with your gifts\r\nif only you give me the one that lifts\r\nme laughing ...\r\nAnd though it costs you nothing,\r\nstill it is of immense value to me.\r\nYour reward will be\r\nnot just to fly\r\nbut to soar, so high\r\nthat your joys vastly exceed your desires.\r\nAnd my beauty, to which your heart aspires\r\nand which you never tire of praising,\r\nI will employ for the raising\r\nof your spirits. Then, lying sweetly at your side,\r\nI will shower you with all the delights of a bride,\r\nwhich I have more expertly learned.\r\nThen you who so fervently burned\r\nwill at last rest, fully content,\r\nfallen even more deeply in love, spent\r\nat my comfortable bosom.\r\nWhen I am in bed with a man I blossom,\r\nbecoming completely free\r\nwith the man who loves and enjoys me.\r\n\r\nHere is a second version of the same poem ...I Resolved to Make a \r\nVirtue of My Desire (II)\r\nby Veronica Franco\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nMy rewards will match your gifts\r\nIf you give me the one that lifts \r\nMe, laughing. If it comes free,\r\nStill, it is of immense value to me. \r\nYour reward will benot just to fly,\r\nBut to soarso incredibly high \r\nThat your joys eclipse your desires\r\n(As my beauty, to which your heart aspires \r\nAnd which you never tire of praising,\r\nI employ for your spirits raising). \r\nAfterwards, lying docile at your side,\r\nI will grant you all the delights of a bride, \r\nWhich I have more expertly learned.\r\nThen you, who so fervently burned, \r\nWill at last rest, fully content,\r\nFallen even more deeply in love, spent \r\nAt my comfortable bosom.\r\nWhen I am in bed with a man I blossom, \r\nBecoming completely free\r\nWith the man who freely enjoys me.\r\nFranco published two books: Terze rime (a collection of poems) and\r\nLettere familiari a diversi (Faa collection of letters and poems). She \r\nalso collected the works of other writers into anthologies and founded a charity \r\nfor courtesans and their children. And she was an early champion of womens \r\nrights, one of the first ardent, outspoken feminists that we know by name today. \r\nFor example ...\r\nCapitolo 24\r\nby Veronica Franco\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n(written by Franco to a man who had insulted a woman) \r\nPlease try to see with sensible eyes\r\nhow grotesque it is for you\r\nto insult and abuse women!\r\nOur unfortunate sex is always subject \r\nto such unjust treatment, because we\r\nare dominated, denied true freedom!\r\nAnd certainly we are not at fault\r\nbecause, while not as robust as men,\r\nwe have equal hearts, minds and intellects.\r\nNor does virtue originate in power,\r\nbut in the vigor of the heart, mind and soul:\r\nthe sources of understanding;\r\nand I am certain that in these regards\r\nwomen lack nothing, \r\nbut, rather, have demonstrated\r\nsuperiority to men.\r\nIf you think us inferior to yourself,\r\nperhaps it\'s because, being wise,\r\nwe outdo you in modesty.\r\nAnd if you want to know the truth,\r\nthe wisest person is the most patient;\r\nshe squares herself with reason and with virtue;\r\nwhile the madman thunders insolence.\r\nThe stone the wise man withdraws from the well\r\nwas flung there by a fool ... \r\nLife was not a bed of roses for Venetian courtesans. Although they enjoyed \r\nthe good graces of their wealthy patrons, religious leaders and commoners saw \r\nthem as symbols of vice. Once during a plague, Franco was banished from Venice \r\nas if her sins had helped cause it. When she returned in 1577, she faced the \r\nInquisition and charges of witchcraft. She defended herself in court and won \r\nher freedom, but lost all her material possessions. Eventually, Domenico Venier, \r\nher major patron, died in 1582 and left her with no support. Her tax declaration \r\nof that same year stated that she was living in a section of the city where many \r\ndestitute prostitutes ended their lives. She may have died in poverty at the age \r\nof forty-five. \r\nHollywood produced a movie based on her life: Dangerous Beauty. \r\nWhen I bed a man\r\nwhoI sensetruly loves and enjoys me,\r\nI become so sweet and so delicious\r\nthat the pleasure I bring him surpasses all delight,\r\ntill the tight \r\nknot of love,\r\nhowever slight\r\nit may have seemed before, \r\nis raveled to the core.\r\nWe danced a youthful jig through that fair city\r\nVenice, our paradise, so pompous and pretty.\r\nWe lived for love, for primal lust and beauty;\r\nto please ourselves became our only duty. \r\nFloating there in a fog between heaven and earth,\r\nWe grew drunk on excesses and wild mirth.\r\nWe thought ourselves immortal poets then, \r\nOur glory endorsed by Gods illustrious pen. \r\nBut paradise, we learned, is fraught with error, \r\nand sooner or later love succumbs to terror. \r\nIn response to a friend urging Veronica Franco to help her daughter become a \r\ncourtesan, Franco warns her that the profession can be devastating: \r\nEven if Fortune were only benign and favorable to you in this endeavor, this \r\nlife is such that in any case it would always be wretched. It is such an unhappy \r\nthing, and so contrary to human nature, to subject ones body and activity to \r\nsuch slavery that one is frightened just by the thought of it: to let oneself be \r\nprey to many, running the risk of being stripped, robbed, killed, so that one \r\nday can take away from you what you have earned with many men in a long time, \r\nwith so many other dangers of injury and horrible contagious disease: to eat \r\nwith someone elses mouth, to sleep with someone elses eyes, to move according \r\nto someone elses whim, running always toward the inevitable shipwreck of ones \r\nfaculties and life. Can there be greater misery than this? ... Believe me, among \r\nall the misfortunes that can befall a human being in the world, this life is the \r\nworst. \r\nI confess I became a courtesan, traded yearning for power, welcomed many \r\nrather than be owned by one. I confess I embraced a whore\'s freedom over a \r\nwife\'s obedience.  Dangerous Beauty, 1998 \r\nI wish it were not a sin to have liked it so.\r\nWomen have not yet realized the cowardice that resides, \r\nfor if they should decide to do so, \r\nthey would be able to fight you until death; \r\nand to prove that I speak the truth,\r\namongst so many women, \r\nI will be the first to act, \r\nsetting an example for them to follow. \r\nHere\'s another loose translation of mine, this one of a poem written in Scots by \r\nHugh MacDiarmid. A watergaw is a fragmentary rainbow. This translation may \r\nbe a bit unusual, since MacDiarmid wrote both English and Scots versions of the \r\npoem, but I like my English version better ...\r\n\r\nThe Watergaw\r\nby Hugh MacDiarmid\r\nloose translation/interpretation by  \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOne wet forenight in the sheep-shearing season\r\nI saw the uncanniest thing\r\na watergaw with its wavering light\r\nshining beyond the wild downpour of rain\r\nand I thought of the last wild look that you gave\r\nwhen you knew you destined for the grave.\r\n\r\nThere was no light in the skylark\'s nest\r\nthat nightnonor any in mine;\r\nbut now often I\'ve thought of that foolish light\r\nand of these irrational hearts of men\r\nand I think that, perhaps, at last I ken\r\nwhat your look meant then.\r\n\r\nIntoxicants\r\nby Amrut Ghayal (a Gujarati poet)\r\ntranslation by Kanu V.

Burch\r\n\r\nWeland knew the agony of exile.\r\nThat indomitable smith was wracked by grief.\r\nHe endured countless troubles:\r\nsorrows were his only companions\r\nin his frozen island dungeon\r\nafter Nithad had fettered him,\r\nmany strong-but-supple sinew-bonds\r\nbinding the better man.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nBeadohild mourned her brothers\' deaths\r\nbut even more, her own sad state\r\nonce she discovered herself with child.\r\nShe predicted nothing good could come of it.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that the Geat\'s moans for Matilda,\r\nhis lady, were limitless,\r\nthat his sorrowful love for her\r\nrobbed him of regretless sleep.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nFor thirty winters Theodric ruled\r\nthe M\xe6ring stronghold with an iron hand;\r\nmany knew this and moaned.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nWe have also heard of Ermanaric\'s wolfish ways,\r\nof how he held wide sway in the realm of the Goths.\r\nHe was a grim king! Many a warrior sat,\r\nfull of cares and maladies of the mind,\r\nwishing constantly that his kingdom might be overthrown.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nIf a man sits long enough, sorrowful and anxious,\r\nbereft of joy, his mind constantly darkening,\r\nsoon it seems to him that his troubles are endless.\r\nThen he must consider that the wise Lord\r\noften moves through the earth\r\ngranting some men honor, glory and fame,\r\nbut others only shame and hardship.\r\nThis I will say for myself:\r\nthat for awhile I was the Heodeninga\'s scop,\r\ndear to my lord. My name was Deor.\r\nFor many winters I held a fine office,\r\nfaithfully serving a just lord. But now Heorrenda\r\na man skilful in songs, has received the estate\r\nthe protector of warriors gave me.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament or The Wife\'s Complaint is an Old English (Anglo-Saxon) \r\npoem found in the Exeter Book which is generally considered to be an elegy in the \r\nmanner of the German frauenlied, or woman\'s song, although there are \r\nother interpretations of the poem\'s genre and purpose. The Exeter Book has been \r\ndated to 960-990 AD, but of course the poem may have been written earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI draw these words from deep wells of my grief,\r\ncare-worn, unutterably sad.\r\nI can recount woes I\'ve borne since birth,\r\npresent and past, never more than now.\r\nI have won, from my exile-paths, only pain.\r\n\r\nFirst, my lord forsook his folk, left,\r\ncrossed the seas\' tumult, far from our people.\r\nSince then, I\'ve known\r\nwrenching dawn-griefs, dark mournings ... oh where,\r\nwhere can he be?\r\n\r\nThen I, too, lefta lonely, lordless refugee,\r\nfull of unaccountable desires!\r\nBut the man\'s kinsmen schemed secretly\r\nto estrange us, divide us, keep us apart,\r\nacross earth\'s wide kingdom, and my heart broke.\r\n\r\nThen my lord spoke:\r\nTake up residence here.\r\nI had few friends in this unknown, cheerless\r\nregion, none close.\r\nChrist, I felt lost!\r\n\r\nThen I thought I had found a well-matched man \r\none meant for me,\r\nbut unfortunately he\r\nwas ill-starred and blind, with a devious mind,\r\nfull of murderous intentions, plotting some crime!\r\n\r\nBefore God we\r\nvowed never to part, not till kingdom come, never!\r\nBut now that\'s all changed, forever \r\nour friendship done, severed.\r\nI must hear, far and near, contempt for my husband.\r\n\r\nSo other men bade me, Go, live in the grove,\r\nbeneath the great oaks, in an earth-cave, alone.\r\nIn this ancient cave-dwelling I am lost and oppressed \r\nthe valleys are dark, the hills immense,\r\nand this cruel-briared enclosurean arid abode!\r\n\r\nThe injustice assails memy lord\'s absence!\r\nOn earth there are lovers who share the same bed\r\nwhile I pass through life dead in this dark abscess\r\nwhere I wilt, summer days unable to rest\r\nor forget the sorrows of my life\'s hard lot.\r\n\r\nA young woman must always be\r\nstern, hard-of-heart, unmoved,\r\nopposing breast-cares and her heartaches\' legions.\r\nShe must appear cheerful\r\neven in a tumult of grief.\r\n\r\nLike a criminal exiled to a far-off land,\r\nmoaning beneath insurmountable cliffs,\r\nmy weary-minded love, drenched by wild storms\r\nand caught in the clutches of anguish,\r\nis reminded constantly of our former happiness.\r\n\r\nWoe be it to them who abide in longing.\r\n\r\nHere are my translations of poems by Sir Muhammad Iqbal (), also \r\nknown as Allama Iqbl (, Allma meaning The Learned One), a Lahori \r\nMuslim poet, philosopher and politician.\r\n\r\nO, Colorful Rose!\r\nby Allama Iqbl\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R.

The poem survived intact because it was quoted in full by Dionysus, a \r\nRoman orator, in his On Literary Composition, published around 30 B.C.\r\nA number of Sappho\'s poems mention or are addressed to Aphrodite, the Greek \r\ngoddess of love. It is believed that Sappho may have belonged to a cult that \r\nworshiped Aphrodite with songs and poetry. If so, Hymn to Aphrodite may have \r\nbeen composed for performance within the cult. However, we have few verifiable \r\ndetails about the real Sappho, and much conjecture based on fragments of her \r\npoetry and what other people said about her, in many cases centuries after her \r\ndeath. We do know, however, that she was held in very high regard. For instance, \r\nwhen Sappho visited Syracuse the residents were so honored they erected a statue \r\nto commemorate the occasion! During Sappho\'s lifetime, coins of Lesbos were \r\nminted with her image. Furthermore, Sappho was called the Tenth Muse and the \r\nother nine were goddesses.\r\nUnholy Trinity\r\nby Angelus Silesius\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWater is pure and clean\r\nwhen taken at the well-head:\r\nbut drink too far from the Source\r\nand you may well end up dead.\r\n\r\nCeaseless Peace\r\nby Angelus Silesius\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\nSince I first set my lips to your full cup,\r\nSince my pallid face first nested in your hands,\r\nSince I sensed your soul and every bloom lit up\r\nTill those rare perfumes were lost to deepening sands;\r\nSince I was once allowed those pleasures deep\r\nTo hear your heart speak mysteries, divine;\r\nSince I have seen you smile, have watched you weep,\r\nYour lips pressed to my lips, your eyes on mine;\r\nSince I have sensed above my thoughts the gleam\r\nOf a ray, a single ray, of your bright star\r\n(If sometimes veiled), and felt light falling stream,\r\nLike one rose petal plucked from high, afar;\r\nI now can say to time\'s swift-changing hours:\r\nPass, pass upon your way, for you grow old;\r\nFlee to the dark abyss with your drear flowers,\r\nbut one unmarred within my heart I hold.\r\nYour flapping wings may jar but cannot spill\r\nThe cup fulfilled of love, from which I drink;\r\nMy heart has fires your frosts can never chill,\r\nMy soul more love to fly than you can sink.\r\n\r\nTo the boy Elis\r\nby Georg Trakl\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nElis, when the blackbird cries from the black forest,\r\nit announces your downfall.\r\nYour lips sip the rock-spring\'s blue coolness.\r\n\r\nYour brow sweats blood\r\nrecalling ancient myths\r\nand dark interpretations of birds\' flight.\r\n\r\nYet you enter the night with soft footfalls;\r\nthe ripe purple grapes hang suspended\r\nas you wave your arms more beautifully in the blueness.\r\n\r\nA thornbush crackles;\r\nwhere now are your moonlike eyes?\r\nHow long, oh Elis, have you been dead?\r\n\r\nA monk dips waxed fingers\r\ninto your body\'s hyacinth;\r\nOur silence is a black abyss\r\n\r\nfrom which sometimes a docile animal emerges\r\nslowly lowering its heavy lids.\r\nA black dew drips from your temples:\r\n\r\nthe lost gold of vanished stars.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR\'S NOTE: I believe that in the second stanza the blood on Elis\'s \r\nforehead may be a reference to the apprehensive bloody sweat of Jesus in the \r\ngarden of Gethsemane. If my interpretation is correct, Elis hears the \r\nblackbird\'s cries, anticipates the danger represented by a harbinger of death, \r\nbut elects to continue rather than turn back. From what I have been able to \r\ngather, the color blue had a special significance for Georg Trakl: it symbolized \r\nlonging and perhaps a longing for death. The colors blue, purple and black may \r\nrepresent a progression toward death in the poem.\r\n\r\n\r\nMirror\r\nby Kajal Ahmad, a Kurdish poet\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy era\'s obscuring mirror\r\nshattered\r\nbecause it magnified the small\r\nand made the great seem insignificant.\r\nDictators and monsters filled its contours.\r\nNow when I breathe\r\nits jagged shards pierce my heart\r\nand instead of sweat\r\nI exude glass.\r\nThe Lonely Earth\r\nby Kajal Ahmad\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThe pale celestial bodies\r\nnever bid her Good morning!\r\nnor do the creative stars\r\nkiss her.\r\nEarth, where so many tender persuasions and roses lie interred,\r\nmight expire for the lack of a glance, or an odor.\r\nShes a lonely dusty orb,\r\nso very lonely!, as she observes the moon\'s patchwork attire\r\nknowing the sun\'s an imposter\r\nwho sears with rays he has stolen for himself\r\nand who looks down on the moon and earth like lodgers.\r\nKurds are Birds\r\nby Kajal Ahmad\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nPer the latest scientific classification, Kurds\r\nnow belong to a species of bird!\r\nThis is why,\r\ntraveling across the torn, fraying pages of history,\r\nthey are nomads recognized by their caravans.\r\nYes, Kurds are birds! And,\r\neven worse, when\r\ntheres nowhere left to nest, no refuge from their pain,\r\nthey turn to the illusion of traveling again\r\nbetween the warm and arctic sectors of their homeland.\r\nSo I dont think it strange Kurds can fly but not land.\r\nThey wander from region to region\r\nnever realizing their dreams\r\nof settling,\r\nof forming a colony, of nesting.\r\nNo, they never settle down long enough\r\nto visit Rumi and inquire about his health,\r\nor to bow down deeply in the gust-\r\nstirred dust,\r\nlike Nali.\r\n\r\nRaise your words, not their volume.\r\nRain grows flowers, not thunder.\r\nRumi, loose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSongbird/Birdsong\r\nby Rumi\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nLead us to pure thought and truth\r\nby your sacred word and long-enduring assistance, \r\nO, eternal Giver of the gifts of righteousness.\r\n\r\nO, wise Lord, grant us spiritual strength and joy; \r\nhelp us overcome our enemies enmity!\r\n\r\nTranslators Note: The Gathas consist of 17 hymns believed to have been composed \r\nby Zarathustra (Zoroaster), whose compositions may date as far back as 1700 BC, \r\nalthough there is no scholarly consensus as to when he lived. These hymns form \r\nthe core of the Zoroastrian liturgy called the Yasna. The language employed, \r\nGathic or Old Avestan, is related to the proto-Indo-Iranian and proto-Iranian \r\nlanguages and to Vedic Sanskrit. The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy \r\ndeems Zoroaster to have been the first philosopher. Zoroaster has also been \r\ncalled the father of ethics, the first rationalist and the first monotheist. In \r\nthe original texts, Ahura Mazda means wise Lord or Lord of Wisdom while \r\nVohuman/Vohu Manah represents pure thought and righteousness and Asha represents \r\ntruth. Angra Mainyu was the chief evil entity, a precursor of Satan. \r\n\r\nThe Ruins of Balaclava \r\nby Adam Mickiewicz (1798-1855) \r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOh, barren Crimean land, these dreary shades\r\nof castlesonce your indisputable pride \r\nare now where ghostly owls and lizards hide \r\nas blackguards arm themselves for nightly raids.\r\n\r\nCarved into marble, regal boasts were made! \r\nBrave words on burnished armor, gilt-applied! \r\nNow shattered splendors long since cast aside \r\nbeside the dead here also brokenly laid.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks erected shimmering marble here. \r\nThe Romans drove wild Mongol hordes to flight. \r\nThe Mussulman prayed eastward, day and night.\r\n\r\nNow owls and dark-winged vultures watch and leer \r\nas strange black banners, flapping overhead, \r\nmark where the past piles high its nameless dead. \r\n\r\nAdam Bernard Mickiewicz (1798-1855) is widely regarded as Polands greatest poet \r\nand as the national poet of Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. He was also a \r\ndramatist, essayist, publicist, translator, professor and political activist. As \r\na principal figure in Polish Romanticism, Mickiewicz has been compared to Byron \r\nand Goethe. \r\n\r\nThis is my translation of one of my favorite songs, S.O.S. ...\r\n\r\nS.O.S.\r\nby Michel Berger\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\n. . . qui laetificat juventutem meam . . .\r\nShe was the joy of my youth,\r\nand now she is gone.\r\n. . . requiescat in pace . . .\r\nMay she rest in peace.\r\n. . . amen . . .\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nI was touched by this Latin prayer, which I discovered in a novel I read as a \r\nteenager. I later decided to incorporate it into a poem, which I started in high \r\nschool and revised as an adult. From what I now \r\nunderstand, ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam means to the God \r\nwho gives joy to my youth, but I am sticking with my original interpretation: a \r\nlament for a little girl at her funeral. The phrase can be traced back to Saint \r\nJerome\'s translation of Psalm 42 in the Latin Vulgate Bible (circa 385 AD). I \r\ncant remember exactly when I read the novel or wrote the poem, but I believe it \r\nwas around my junior year of high school, age 17 or thereabouts. This \r\nwas my first translation. I revised the poem slightly in 2001 after realizing I \r\nhad misremembered one of the words in the Latin prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next poem is a loose translation of the work of the Romanian poet \r\nStefan Ovidiu. This was my first translation after Elegy for a little girl, \r\nlost and the first one in which I translated the words of another poet.\r\nUnder Water\r\nby Stefan Ovidiu\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nEven my dreams\r\ncry\r\nsometimes,\r\nfor the souls of transported soldiers\r\nburied so deep\r\nbeneath\r\nthe water mark.\r\nThey lost\r\ntheir fortunate stars,\r\nfar from home\'s capacious skies\r\nand their lovers\' eyes,\r\nunborn to the womb\r\nof the earth\'s great lies.\r\nI awake in the night\r\nhearing the sound of the sea\r\nbreathe with you,\r\nsighing, distracted,\r\nprobing the declivities\r\nof a land so full of tears and stars.\r\n\r\nAmmiditna\'s Hymn to Itar\r\nAncient Akkadian poem, author unknown\r\nloose\r\ntranslation/interpretation by Michael R.
