While I admit that my rankings \r\nhere are not scientific, I did consult a number of sources. I started with \r\nGoogle\'s rankings of the most popular poems and the most read poems \r\n(searches which return similar but different results). I then factored in the \r\nnumber of direct hits obtained by enclosing the main part of each title in \r\nquotation marks (not as helpful when the title happens to be a common term, so I \r\nrepeated the searches using the poets\' last names). I \r\nalso referred to reader polls such as Ranker\'s. And I used Lithub\'s rankings of \r\nthe top poems by inclusions in anthologies over the last 25 years and William \r\nHarmon\'s rankings of older anthologies. I then tried \r\nto determine which poems appeared highest in the most lists. While this may be \r\nless than scientific, I think the results are interesting and meaningful. The \r\nconstruct [#] means the poem ranked at the designated position in William \r\nHarmon\'s index of the 500 most anthologized poems. An asterisk means there is a \r\nnote about the poem or poet at the end of the section. It\'s interesting, I \r\nthink, that most of the highly popular poems on the Internet also appear in \r\nHarmon\'s index. That suggests that anthologists have done a generally \r\ncommendable job of including the best poems, or that being included in \r\nanthologies makes poems more popular with the reading public. (Or perhaps a bit \r\nof both.) But there are some head-scratchers; for instance, why is the \r\ntop-ranked poem with modern readers only #149 with the anthologists? \r\n\r\nHere are some general observations: (1) The anthologists understandably tend to omit \r\nextremely long poems like Paradise Lost, The Faerie Queen and The Waste \r\nLand. (2) They also tend to omit story poems like The Raven, The Highwayman \r\nand The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (perhaps due to length, but even shorter \r\nstory poems like The Charge of the Light Brigade seem to be out of favor). (3) \r\nAnthologists seem to frown on inspirational poems like If and Invictus. (4) \r\nPoets who have written more recently have not had as much time to be \r\nanthologized; for instance, Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou. Therefore, I have \r\ngiven more weight to reader preferences.\r\n\r\ncompiled by  Michael R. Burch \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Top Ten Most Popular Poems of All Time\r\n\r\n(#1) The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost had 1.1 million direct hits according \r\nto Google, 671K with the poet\'s last name included [#149] \r\n(#2) Do Not Go Gentle (Into That Good Night) by Dylan Thomas had 1.2 million \r\ndirect hits, 391K with the poet\'s last name included [#37] \r\n(#3) The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe had 16.6 million direct hits, even \r\nwith the poet\'s last name included! [#102]\r\n(#4) The Tyger by William Blake had 492K direct hits with the \r\npoet\'s last name included [#1*]\r\n(#5) Stopping by Woods (on a Snowy Evening) by Robert Frost had 474K \r\ndirect hits [#6]\r\n(#6) The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge had 390K \r\ndirect hits [#84] \r\n(#7) The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot had 306K direct hits \r\n[#27] \r\n(#8) Shall I Compare Thee (to a Summer\'s Day) by William Shakespeare had 306K \r\ndirect hits [#23]\r\n(#9) Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley had 1.6 million direct hits, 199K with \r\nthe poet\'s last name included [#21]\r\n(#10) The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot had 2.5 million direct hits, \r\n178K with the poet\'s last name included [#195]\r\n\r\n[*] NOTES: The top three poems are very close, with The Raven leading in \r\ndirect hits and the other two ranking higher with other sources. William \r\nBlake\'s The Tyger is the most anthologized poem in the English language and it \r\nremains very popular on the web. The second-most anthologized poem, the ancient \r\nballad Sir Patrick Spens, is not as popular today according to Google, perhaps \r\ndue to dusty language, so it ended up in my Honorable Mentions. It\'s hard to \r\nquibble with any of the poems above, although I would have included William \r\nButler Yeats (The Wild Swans at Coole), Louise Bogan (Song for the Last Act \r\nor After the Persian), Wallace Stevens (The Snow Man) and Hart Crane (the \r\nlong version of Voyages).\r\n\r\nThe Top Twenty-Five Most Popular Poems of All Time\r\n\r\n(#11) All the World\'s a Stage and That Time of Year Thou Mayest in Me Behold \r\n[#4] by William Shakespeare\r\n(#12) If by Rudyard Kipling [not popular with the anthologists]\r\n(#13) A Red, Red Rose [#122] by Robert Burns (the poem Bob Dylan said inspired \r\nhis artistic career)\r\n(#14) Invictus by William Ernest Henley (the favorite poem of Nelson Mandela)\r\n(#15) O Captain! My Captain! [#208] by Walt Whitman (one of his rare rhyming \r\npoems, an elegy for Abraham Lincoln)\r\n(#16) Dulce et Decorum Est [#102] and Anthem for Doomed Youth [#31] by \r\nWilfred Owen\r\n(#17) Paradise Lost by John Milton (the last major epic poem in English, and \r\nstill a marvel of the language)\r\n(#18) Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold [#8]\r\n(#19) The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri \r\n(#20) I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Still I Rise by Maya Angelou\r\n(#21) A Dream Within a Dream and Annabel Lee [#124] by Edgar Allan Poe \r\n(#22) To His Coy Mistress [#11] and The Garden [#62] by Andrew Marvell \r\n(#23) Ode on a Grecian Urn [#49], Ode to a Nightingale [#26], La Belle Dame \r\nsans Merci [#9] and To Autumn [#3*] by John Keats\r\n(#24) The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes [*]\r\n(#25) I Wondered Lonely as a Cloud [#42] and Daffodils by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] NOTES: William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Wilfred Owen, Robert Frost \r\nand T. S. Eliot each have two of the top twenty-five \r\npoems, while Edgar Allan Poe has three and John Keats four. I was surprised and \r\ndelighted to see The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes appear in the top twenty-five. \r\nIt\'s one of the most musical poems in the English language, and one of the \r\nspookiest. My mother used to read it to me and my sisters when we were children. \r\nToday there are compelling YouTube performances of the poem as well. It\'s one of \r\nthe very best ghost stories, and well worth the time to explore (especially if \r\nyou have, or know, children). To Autumn by John Keats is the third-most \r\nanthologized poem, according to William Harmon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Top Fifty Most Popular Poems of All Time\r\n\r\n(#26) One Art and The Fish [#177] by Elizabeth Bishop\r\n(#27) Birches [#236] by Robert Frost\r\n(#28) Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge [#7]\r\n(#29) Ulysses [#95] and The Charge of the Light Brigade [#284] by Alfred, \r\nLord Tennyson\r\n(#30) Sunday Morning [#116] and The Emperor of Ice-Cream [#173] by Wallace \r\nStevens\r\n(#31) The Windhover [#30] and Pied Beauty [#5] by Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n(#32) The Odyssey and The Iliad by Homer\r\n(#33) The Faerie Queen by Edmund Spenser\r\n(#34) Dreams and Harlem (A Dream Deferred) by Langston Hughes\r\n(#35) To an Athlete Dying Young [#127] and Loveliest of Trees [#55] by A.

Walt Whitman, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot and \r\nEdgar Allan Poe each have three. I was \r\nespecially happy to see Wulf and Eadwacer appear in the top fifty, as it\'s a \r\npoem I have translated myself and have spent years promoting. It may be the \r\noldest poem in the English language written by a female poet, and it\'s as \r\npowerful today as the day it was penned. The poem appears below, along with \r\nseveral others in the top fifty. I like to think that I may have played a part \r\nin the poem appearing in the top twenty-five with Google for most read poems of \r\nall time. \r\n\r\nHIGH HONORABLE MENTION: To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time [#10] and Upon \r\nJulia\'s Clothes [#14] by Robert Herrick, The Passionate Shepherd to His Love \r\n[#11] by Christopher Marlowe, They Flee from Me [#39] by Sir Thomas Wyatt, \r\nSir Patrick Spens [#2] by Anonymous, My Last Duchess [#43] by Robert \r\nBrowning, The Darkling Thrush [#54] by Thomas Hardy, If You Forget Me by \r\nPablo Neruda, Phenomenal Woman by Maya Angelou, For the Union Dead [#196] \r\nand Skunk Hour [#103] by Robert Lowell, The Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop, \r\nMus\xe9e des Beaux Arts [#67] and Funeral Blues by W.

Many years ago, I was unable to find the best version of \r\nthe poem online. The versions I was able to find were wretched facsimiles, with \r\nglaring errors. So I looked up the poem in one of my anthologies and typed it in \r\nvery carefully. For some time, to my knowledge, that was the only correct \r\nversion of the poem available on the web. \r\n\r\nSOURCES: Google the most popular poems of all time search; Google the most \r\nread poems of all time search; Google individual searches of the top ten poems \r\nby title (with and without the poet\'s last name); Ranker; Lithub; AllPoetry; \r\nWilliam Harmon\'s introduction to his Top 500 Poems anthology and his \r\nindex of The Poems in Order of Popularity.\r\n\r\nAccording to William Harmon, the top poets in the English language, ranked by \r\nthe number of poems anthologized, are William Shakespeare (29), Anonymous (21), \r\nJohn Donne (19), William Blake (18), Emily Dickinson (14), William Butler Yeats \r\n(14), William Wordsworth (13), Gerard Manley Hopkins (12), Alfred Tennyson (11), \r\nThomas Hardy (11), Robert Frost (11) and John Keats (10). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\npass into nothingness ...\r\nJohn Keats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon ballad, circa 990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nhuge, battle-strong arms grabbed and engulfed me.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s Notes: This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a \r\nwild lament, a lover\'s lament, a passion play, a riddle, a song, or an early \r\nballad (it may be the earliest English poem with a refrain). However, most scholars place it within the genre of the frauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\nextant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage; it seems likely that the poet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of \r\nancient scops pretending to be women. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called \r\nthe first English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and \r\nmocking the man who has been raping and impregnating her. And the poem\'s closing \r\nmetaphor of a loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never \r\nharmonized remains one of the strongest in the English language, or any \r\nlanguage.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\n\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\ndom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\nOf the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\nAs a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\nRebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\nBuckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\nNo wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\nFall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nHold fast to dreams\r\nFor if dreams die\r\nLife is a broken-winged bird\r\nThat cannot fly.\r\n\r\nHold fast to dreams\r\nFor when dreams go\r\nLife is a barren field\r\nFrozen with snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarlem: A Dream Deferred\r\n\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nWhat happens to a dream deferred?\r\n\r\nDoes it dry up\r\nlike a raisin in the sun?\r\nOr fester like a sore\r\nAnd then run?\r\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\r\nOr crust and sugar over\r\nlike a syrupy sweet?\r\n\r\nMaybe it just sags\r\nlike a heavy load.\r\n\r\nOr does it explode?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks\r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs\r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.\r\nMen marched asleep. Many had lost their boots\r\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.\r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling,\r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime...\r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace\r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin;\r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\r\nPro patria mori.\r\n\r\nNote: Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\nfrom Horace\'s Odes and means: It is sweet and fitting\r\nto die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tyger\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\r\nIn the forests of the night\r\nWhat immortal hand or eye\r\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\nIn what distant deeps or skies\r\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\r\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\r\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\r\n\r\nAnd what shoulder,  what art,\r\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\r\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\r\nWhat dread hand?  what dread feet?\r\n\r\nWhat the hammer? what the chain?\r\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\r\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp\r\nDare its deadly terrors clasp?\r\n\r\nWhen the stars threw down their spears,\r\nAnd water\'d heaven with their tears,\r\nDid he smile his work to see?\r\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\r\n\r\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\r\nIn the forests of the night,\r\nWhat immortal hand or eye\r\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Was One-and-Twenty\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\r\nI heard a wise man say,\r\nGive crowns and pounds and guineas\r\nBut not your heart away;\r\nGive pearls away and rubies\r\nBut keep your fancy free.\r\nBut I was one-and-twenty,\r\nNo use to talk to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\r\nI heard him say again,\r\nThe heart out of the bosom\r\nWas never given in vain;\r\n\'Tis paid with sighs a plenty\r\nAnd sold for endless rue.\r\nAnd I am two-and-twenty\r\nAnd oh, \'tis true, \'tis true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe Walks In Beauty\r\nby Lord Bryon\r\n\r\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\r\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\r\nAnd all that\'s best of dark and bright\r\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes:\r\nThus mellow\'d to that tender light\r\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\r\n\r\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\r\nHad half impair\'d the nameless grace\r\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\r\nOr softly lightens o\'er her face;\r\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express\r\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nAnd on that cheek, and o\'er that brow,\r\nSo soft, so calm, yet eloquent,\r\nThe smiles that win, the tints that glow,\r\nBut tell of days in goodness spent,\r\nA mind at peace with all below,\r\nA heart whose love is innocent!\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
