In this case the first \ngreat lyric poet may \nstill be the best.\nLyric poetryat least as we think of it todayprobably begins with Sappho of Lesbos, who \nwas described by her ancient peers as the Tenth Muse. (Since the first nine Muses were \ngoddesses, Sappho had quite a reputation!) Outstanding lyric poets  \nwho wrote in the English language include Conrad Aiken, W. H. Auden, Elizabeth \nBishop, Lord Byron, Emily Dickinson, John Donne, Ernest Dowson, T. S. Eliot, \nThomas Hardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Langston Hughes, Ben Jonson, John Keats, D. \nH. Lawrence, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Lowell, John Milton, Wilfred Owen, \nSylvia Plath, Ezra Pound, E. A. Robinson, William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, \nEdmund Spenser, Alfred Lord Tennyson, \nWalt Whitman, William Wordsworth and Sir Thomas Wyatt. Other notable \nlyric poets include singer-songwriters like Adele, Jackson Browne, Johnny Cash, Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan \n(who adopted his last name from the first name of the great Welsh poet Dylan \nThomas), Eminem, Dido, Dan Fogelberg, Woody Guthrie, Michael Jackson, Carole King, John \nLennon, Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Pete Seeger, \nPrince, Smokey Robinson, Bruce Springsteen, Hank Williams Sr., Brian Wilson \nand Stevie Wonder. \n\nFor whatever it\'s worth, my top ten lyric poets in alphabetical order are: William Blake, Louise Bogan, \nRobert Burns, Hart Crane, e. e. cummings, Robert Frost, A. E. Housman, Wallace \nStevens, Dylan Thomas and William Butler Yeats.\n\nIf you are more interested in lyrical poetry (i.e., poetry that is \nmusical and songlike), please click here: \nThe Best Lyrical Poems.\n\ncompiled \nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSing, my sacred tortoiseshell lyre;\ncome, let my words\naccompany your voice!\nSappho, fragment 118, translated by Michael R. Burch\n\nLyric Poetry Definition, Origins and History\n\nLyric poetry is usually short in length and expresses \npersonal thoughts and emotions without the plot and character development \ncommon to narrative poetry, dramatic poetry, epic poetry, plays and novels. Lyric poems \nusually begin in medias res (in the middle of things, without \npreamble). A great lyric \npoem is like a lightning bolt out of a clear blue sky: an unexpected thrill or \nterror, depending on the poem and the reader\'s \nperspective. If you stick with me for a few minutes, you\'ll have the chance to \nexperience some of the most dazzling lightning bolts in the English language, \nthen judge for yourself. Here\'s a quick example:\n\nEros harrows my heart: \nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\nuprooting oaks.\nSappho, fragment 142, translated by Michael R. Burch\n\nIn the ancient world, such poems were often accompanied by someone playing the lyrea \nharp-like instrumentand thus lyric poems and song lyrics are closely related kissing cousins. \nA modern singer-songwriter crooning while strumming a guitar is following in the \nfootsteps of minstrels of the past who sang or chanted their poems to the \naccompaniment of musical instruments like the harp and lyre. The \nconnection between lyric poems and song lyrics can be clearly seen in the first \nepigram of Sappho above, and in this one below:\n\nNow, I shall sing these songs\nBeautifully\nfor my companions.\n\nSappho, fragment 3, translated by Julia Dubnoff\n\n\nSappho fans can find other translations of her poems later on this page. Please \ndon\'t miss this opportunity to read some truly wonderful poems by a \nremarkable ancient poet who remains fresh and relevant today. Other great lyric poets who wrote in languages other than \nEnglish include the oriental masters Basho and Buson; the great female oriental \npoet Ono no Komachi; the early master of the sonnet (little song), Petrarch; the writer of the \nBible\'s Song of Songs (considered by many to be King Solomon) and \nPsalms (said to have been written by Solomon\'s father, King David); \nthe heretical medieval Latin poet known as the Archpoet; the ancient Greek poets \nSimonides and Pindar; the ancient Roman poets Horace, Catullus and Ovid; Middle \nEastern poets such as Rumi, Hafiz and Omar Khayyam; the French poets Pierre de \nRonsard, Paul Verlaine and Charles Baudelaire; the German poets Johann Wolfgang \nvonGoethe and Rainer Marie Rilke; the Russian poets Aleksandr Pushkin, Anna \nAkhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva; the Spanish poet \nFederico Garc\xedaLorca; the Palestinian poets Mahmoud Darwish and Fadwa Tuqan; \nthe Jewish holocaust poets Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti and Paul Celan; the Indian poet \nRabindranathTagore; the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz; the Mexican poet Octavio \nPaz; and the Chilean poets Pablo Neruda and \nGabriela Mistral. Of course there are many other worthy names; these are the ones \nthat jumped out at me as I checked my memory banks for outstanding lyric poets \nfrom around the globe. \n\nDifferences Between Lyric, Dramatic and Narrative Poetry\n\nDramatic poetry is meant to be spoken: for instance, the soliloquies of Hamlet, \nLear, Othello and Macbeth. \nNarrative poems tell stories: for instance, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere \nand the haunting poetic ghost story The Highwayman by Alfred \nNoyes. Epic poems are longer narrative poems; for instance Beowulf \nand Paradise Lost. Ballads also tell stories; for instance, Sir Patrick Spens. But a lyric \npoem may exist merely or primarily to convey an image, feeling, thought or impression, as in ancient Greek epitaphs \n(a form of epigram). By way of example, here are my modern English interpretations \nof gravestone inscriptions attributed to various Greek masters:\n\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\nbut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\nMichael R. Burch, after Plato\n\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\nOnly the sea gull\nin his high, lonely circuits may tell.\nMichael R. Burch, after Glaucus\n\nPasserby,\ntell the Spartans we lie\nhere, dead at their word,\nobedient to their command.\nHave they heard?\nDo they understand?\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\n\nBlame not the gale, nor the inhospitable sea-gulf, nor friends tardiness,\nmariner! Just mans foolhardiness.\nMichael R. Burch, after Leonidas of Tarentum\n\nHere he lies, in state tonight: \ngreat is his Monument!\nYet Ares cares not, \nneither does War relent.\nMichael R. Burch, after Anacreon\n\nAres was the Greek god of war, known as Mars to the Romans. These poems \ndemonstrate that the ancient Greek lyric poets were not so very different from \npoets today. \n\nThe Method of Lyric Poetry: How Does it Work?\n\nLyric poems often strike chords in readers and set them resonating instantaneously \nby invoking things common to all humanity: the fear of death, the sadness of \nlives cut short, the sorrow of parting, etc. But of course lyric poems can also \nstrike sweet, highly positive chords as well: love, friendship, companionship, \netc. Here\'s a moving example of a lyric poem that blends sweet and sad chords:\n\nBread and Musicby Conrad Aiken\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nHaiku and Epigrams Are Related Forms of Lyric Poetry\n\nHaiku can be quite similar to the best Greek epigrams: short and sweet, or (more \noften) short and bittersweet. Here are my translations of two wonderful haiku by \nOriental masters:\n\nThe butterfly\n\nperfuming its wings\nfans the orchid\n Matsuo Basho, translated by Michael R. Burch\n\nOh, fallen camellias,\nif I were you,\nI\'d leap into the torrent! \n Takaha Shugyo, translated by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe fact that the ancient Greek and ancient Oriental masters adopted \nsimilar methods may suggest that lyric poetry rises from a wellspring of \ncommon humanity.\n\nAttributes of Popular Lyric Poetry and Song Lyrics\n\nLyric poems do not require rhyme or regular meter, although many lyric poems \ndo rhyme, have a discernible beat and/or have been set to music. Some of the \nbest-known songs of all time are lyric poems that were set to music: for \ninstance, Auld Lang Syne by the Scottish poet Robert Burns and To Celia \nby the English poet Ben Jonson:\n\n\nTo Celia\nby Ben Jonson\n\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\nDoth ask a drink divine:\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\nI would not change for thine.\n\n    I sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\n    Not so much honouring thee,\n    As giving it a hope, that there\n    It could not withered be.\n    But thou thereon didst only breathe,\n    And sent\'st back to me:\n    Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,\n    Not of itself, but thee.\n \nTraditional songs like Greensleeves, Shenandoah, \nWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home, Molly Malone and Danny Boy are \nother examples of lyric poems set to music, as are most of the best-loved hymns.\nSome of the best-known contemporary songwriters are lyric poets. In fact, Bob Dylan, Jim \nMorrison and Jewel have published books of poems, while Paul Simon wrote some of \nhis most famous songs as poems, then set them to music later:\n\n\nI Am a Rock\nby Paul Simon; performed by Simon  Garfunkel \n\n\nA winter\'s day\nIn a deep and dark December;\nI am alone,\nGazing from my window to the streets below\nOn a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island.\n\nI\'ve built walls,\nA fortress deep and mighty,\nThat none may penetrate.\nI have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.\nIts laughter and its loving I disdain.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island.\n\nDon\'t talk of love;\nI\'ve heard the word before;\nIt\'s sleeping in my memory.\nI won\'t disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.\nIf I never loved I never would have cried.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island.\n\nI have my books\nAnd my poetry to protect me;\nI am shielded in my armor,\nHiding in my room, safe within my womb,\nI touch no one and no one touches me.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island.\n\nAnd a rock feels no pain;\nAnd an island never cries.\n\n\nPaul Simon wrote this poem, I suspect, in response to a famous statement by \nanother poet, John Donne. Donne claimed that no man is an island. Simon, it \nappears, begged to differ.\n\n\n\nThe History of Lyric Poetry, Spoken-Word Poetry and Performance \nPoetry\n\nLyric poetry has a long history, with a good degree of cross pollination \ndown the years. (Indeed, the song above seems to be a young, unhappy poet\'s \nrefutation of the lyric poet John Donne\'s assertion that no man is an island.) Aristotle mentioned lyric \npoetry (kitharistike, played to the cithara, a musical instrument \nsimilar to the lyre, and the forerunner of the modern guitar) in his Poetics, \nalong with drama, epic poetry, dancing, painting and other forms of mimesis. \nArchaic and classical Greek lyric poetry involved live performances accompanied \nby stringed instruments, so lyric poetry may be the first \nperformance poetry that didnt require a stage, actors and a chorus. If the \npoet was also the musician, he could be a one man band, so the first lyric \npoets were probably the Bob Dylans of their day. Here\'s one of the earliest \nlyric poems to have been written in the English language (although the original poem is \nvirtually unreadable today, resembling ancient German more than modern English):\n\n\nWulf and Eadwacer \n anonymous ballad, circa 960-990 AD\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe outlanders pursue him as if he were game.\nThey will kill him if he comes in force.\nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nWulf is on one island; I, on another.\nThat island is fast, surrounded by fens.\nThere are fierce men on this island.\nThey will kill him if he comes in force.\nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like a panting hound.\nWhenever it rained and I woke disconsolate\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\nFor me, there was pleasure, but its end was loathsome. \nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\nhave left me famished, but why should I eat?\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A she-wolf has borne\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\nOne can easily sunder what never was one:\nour song together.\n\nLyric Poetry was the Province of the First Great Female Poets\n\nWulf and Eadwacer has been one of my favorite poems since the first time I \nread it. In fact, I admired the poem so much that I ended up translating it myself. \nThis is quite possibly \nthe first extant English poem by a female poet. It is also one of the first English \npoems to employ a refrain, and its closing metaphor of a loveless relationship \nbeing like a song in which two voices never harmonized remains one of the \nstrongest in English literature.\n\nOne of the best and most famous lyric poets of antiquity was a woman, Sappho. \nSappho was born on the island of \nLesbos around 620 BC. According to the Parian Marble, Sappho was exiled \nto Sicily sometime between 604 and 594. Cicero mentioned that a statue of \nher stood in the town hall of Syracuse, so she was famous in \nher own day, or soon thereafter. She \nis a mortal marvel, wrote Antipater of Sidon, before proceeding to catalog the \nSeven Wonders of the World. It is because of the homoerotic nature of some of \nSappho\'s poems that "lesbian" and "sapphic" have their current \nsexual denotations and connotations. Most of Sappho\'s poetry has been lost, but her reputation has \nendured through surviving fragments, many of them fleshed out by other poets \nwho sought to "fill in the blanks." (Of the 189 known fragments of her work, \ntwenty contain just one readable word, thirteen have only two, and \nnearly half \nhave ten or fewer.) Major \npoets like Ben Jonson, T. S. Eliot, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Elizabeth Barrett \nBrowning, Robert Lowell and Lord Byron either translated her work or wrote \npoems in response to hers, so she has been (and remains) obviously influential \n...\n\nSappho, fragment 58\ntranslated by Mary Barnard\n\nPain penetrates\nMe drop\nby drop\n\nSappho, fragment 155\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\n\nA short transparent frock?\nIt\'s just my luck\nyour lips were made to mock! \n\nSappho, fragment 156\n\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nShe keeps her scents \nin a dressing-case\nand her sense? \nIn some undiscoverable place. \n\n\nSappho, fragment 159\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMay I lead?\nWill you follow?\nFoolish man! ...\nEars so hollow,\nminds so shallow,\nnever can!\n\n\nSappho, fragment 39\n\nby Charles Algernon Swinburne, Songs of the Springtides\n\nThe tawny sweetwinged thing\nWhose cry was but of Spring.\n\n\nThe Most Popular Form of Western Lyric Poetry: the Sonnet\n\nHistorically the most popular form of lyric poetry in the Western tradition has \nbeen the \nsonnet, most commonly Petrarchan or Shakespearean, but with many other \nvarieties, such as unrhymed blank verse sonnets; the curtal, sprung-rhythm \nsonnets of Gerard Manley Hopkins; the free verse sonnets of e. e. cummings with \ntheir eclectic phrasing, capitalization and typography; and basically the \nkitchen sink and everything in between ...\n\n\nSonnet 147\n\nby William Shakespeare\n\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\n\nFor I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\n\nPetrarchan and Shakespearean sonnets are generally written in iambic pentameter \n(ten syllables per line, with a fairly regular pattern of stressed and \nunstressed syllables: for I have SWORN \nthee FAIR and THOUGHT \nthee BRIGHT) with a predefined rhyme scheme. For \ninstance, a Shakespearean sonnet has the rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. \nBut metrical variation is allowed in such sonnets, and even the poets who made \nup the rules sometimes broke them: Shakespeare, for instance. In fact, \nShakespeare had to break the existing rules of his day in order to create the \nform that is now named after him. As Anthony Hecht pointed out in his article on \nthe sonnet for Encyclopedia Britannica, canonical forms like the sonnet demand \ninnovation from poets who wish to become original artists in their own right.\n\nOther Popular Forms of Lyric Poetry\n\nLyric poetry also appears \nin a wide variety of other forms, including ballades, canzones and villanelles:\n\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\nDylan Thomas\n\n\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night is the best-known villanelle in the \nEnglish language, and justifiably so. \n\nThe Free Verse Lyric\n\nBut today the most common form of lyric poetry is unrhymed, metrically ad-hoc \nfree verse:\n\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\nby Walt Whitman\n\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\nBut the lines easily blur, as in the magnificent poem below, which has elements \nof both formal blank verse and free verse:\n\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\n\nSundays too my father got up early\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\nthen with cracked hands that ached\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\nwho had driven out the cold\nand polished my good shoes as well.\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\nRobert Hayden is probably an unknown or undervalued poet to most readers today, \nbut every reader should be intimately familiar with this wonderful poem. Those \nWinter Sundays illustrates how one poem can make a poet immortal. I may never \nremember another poem by Hayden, but I will certainly never forget this one.\n\nOther Influences on Lyric Poetry and its Continuing History\n\nEnglish poetry has its roots ancient Greek lyric poets like Sappho, but other \nlater European poets were also highly influential, as were Oriental masters like \nBasho and Li Po, once Western poets discovered their work.\nIn Italy, Petrarch developed the sonnet form he inherited \nfrom Giacomo da Lentini and which Dante had used in his Vita Nuova. \nIn 1327, the sight of a woman named Laura in the church \nof Sainte-Claire d\'Avignon inspired Petrarch to celebrate \nher in \nRime sparse ("Scattered rhymes"). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch\'s \nstyle named his collection of poems Il Canzoniere ("Song Book"). \nPetrarch\'s love poems were both the culmination of medieval courtly love poetry and the \norigin of the Renaissance love lyric. Shortly thereafter English poets like Thomas \nWyatt, Henry Howard, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare \nhelped popularize the sonnet with their readers ...\n\nThey Flee from Me\nby Thomas Wyatt\n\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\nThat now are wild and do not remember\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\n\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\n\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\n\nThomas Wyatt lived during the \nreign of King Henry VIII. Wyatt\'s Whoso List to Hunt may have been written to \nAnne Boleyn, the mistress of Henry who became his queen, only to be beheaded.\nAnother wonderful poem of this period is Sweet Rose of Virtue by the Scottish \npoet William Dunbar:\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\nloose translation by \nMichael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue. \n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\nwhose piteous death does my heart such terrible pain\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\nWilliam Dunbar\'s magnificent Sweet Rose of Virtue is one of my favorite \npoems from the early days of English poetry. I chose to translate it myself, to make \nit more accessible to modern readers.\n\nIn France, Pierre \nde Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Jean-Antoine de Ba\xeff led the way. Ronsard \ninfluenced the great Irish poet William Butler Yeats, as we can see in his loose \ntranslation of a poem by Ronsard:\n\n\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\nSpanish devotional poetry adapted the lyric for religious purposes. Notable Spanish \npoets include Teresa of Avila, Saint John of the Cross, Sor Juana In\xe9s de la \nCruz, Garcilaso de la Vega and Lope de Vega. Although better known for his epic \nLusiadas, Lu\xeds de Cam\xf5es is also considered the greatest Portuguese lyric poet \nof the period.\n\nLyric was the dominant poetic idiom in 17th century English poetry from John \nDonne to Andrew Marvell. The best poems from this period are usually short, rarely tell a story \nand are intense in expression, often in a metaphysical vein. Other notable lyric poets of this era include Ben \nJonson, Robert Herrick, George Herbert, Aphra Behn, Thomas Carew, John Suckling, \nRichard Lovelace, John Milton, Richard Crashaw, and Henry Vaughan ...\n\nSong\nby John Donne\n\nGo and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,\nTell me where all past years are,\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\nAnd find\nWhat wind\nServes to advance an honest mind.\n\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\nThings invisible to see,\nRide ten thousand days and nights\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\nAnd swear\nNo where\nLives a woman true and fair.\n\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\nYet do not; I would not go,\nThough at next door we might meet.\nThough she were true when you met her,\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\nYet she\nWill be\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\n\nJohn Donne wrote some of the sexiest poems in the English language, and some of \nthe best devotional poems as well. Talk about range!\nIn the 18th century lyric poetry declined in England and \nFrance. The atmosphere of the English coffee-house or French salon, where \nliterature was discussed, was not congenial to lyric poetry. Exceptions \ninclude the lyrics of Robert Burns, William Cowper, Thomas Gray and Oliver \nGoldsmith. Notable German lyric poets of the period include Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Novalis \nand Friedrich Schiller.\n\n\nA Red, Red Rose\n\nby Robert Burns\n\n\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\n\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\n\nRobert Burns was one of the early romantics and still reads well today. He is, of course, most famous \ntoday for his \nnostalgic drinking song Auld Lang Syne.\nIn Europe the lyric emerged as the principal poetic form of the 19th century, \nand came to be seen as synonymous with poetry itself. Romantic lyric poetry \nconsists of first-person accounts of the thoughts and feelings of a specific \nmoment; feelings are extreme and usually intensely personal.\nThe traditional form of the sonnet was revived in \nBritain, with William Wordsworth writing more sonnets than any other British \npoet. Other important Romantic lyric poets of the period include William Blake, \nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Bryon and Percy Bysshe Shelley ...\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \n) \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\n\nLater in the century the Victorian lyric was more \nlinguistically self-conscious and conventional than earlier Romantic lyrics. \nVictorian lyric poets include Alfred Lord Tennyson and Christina Rossetti ...\n\n\nSong\nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\nLyric poetry was popular with the German reading public between 1830 and 1890, \nas demonstrated by the number of poetry anthologies published \nduring that period. According to Georg Luk\xe1cs, the verse of Joseph von Eichendorff \nexemplifies the German Romantic revival of the folk-song tradition, initiated by \nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and receiving new impetus \nwith the publication of Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano\'s collection of \nFolk Songs, Des Knaben Wunderhorn.\n\nThe 19th century in France saw a confident recovery of the lyric voice after \nits relative demise in the 18th century. The lyric became the dominant mode in \nFrench poetry during this period. Charles Baudelaire was, at least for Walter Benjamin, the \nlast European example of lyric poetry successful on a mass scale.\n\nThe eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries saw the rise \nof Russian lyric poetry, exemplified by Aleksandr Pushkin. The Swedish "Phosphorists" were influenced by the Romantic movement \nand their chief poet, Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom produced many lyric poems. \nItalian lyric poets of the period include Ugo Foscolo, Giacomo Leopardi, \nGiovanni Pascoli and Gabriele D\'Annunzio. Japanese lyric poets include Taneda \nSantoka, Masaoka Shiki and Ishikawa Takuboku. Spanish lyric poets include \nGustavo Adolfo B\xe9cquer, Rosal\xeda de Castro and Jos\xe9 de Espronceda.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, rhymed lyric poetry, usually expressing \nthe feelings of the poet, was the dominant poetic form in America, Europe and \nthe British colonies. English poets like A. E. Housman \nand Walter \nde la Mare employed rhymed lyrics skillfully and \nmovingly ...\n\nExcerpts from More Poems, XXXVI\n\nby A. E. Housman\n\nHere dead lie we because we did not choose\n  To live and shame the land from which we sprung.\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\n  But young men think it is, and we were young.\n\nI have loved the four lines above by Housman, since I first read them. He could \nwrite movingly without indulging in images, melodrama or sophistry, and rivals \nShakespeare in what he could accomplish with direct statement. Housman is \ncertainly a major poet, and one of our very best critics of society and \nreligion, along with William Blake, Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. \n\nThe Bengali poet Rabindranath \nTagore was praised by William Butler Yeats for his lyric poetry and compared \nwith the troubadour poets, when the two met in 1912. Yeats was perhaps the last \nof the great Romantics and the first of the great Modernists ...\n\n\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \n\n\n\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\nThose that I guard I do not love;\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\nNo likely end could bring them loss\nOr leave them happier than before.\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\nA lonely impulse of delight\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\nA waste of breath the years behind\nIn balance with this life, this death.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\nThe woodland paths are dry,\nUnder the October twilight the water\nMirrors a still sky;\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\nSince I first made my count;\nI saw, before I had well finished,\nAll suddenly mount\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\nAnd now my heart is sore.\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\nThe first time on this shore,\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\nThey paddle in the cold,\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water\nMysterious, beautiful;\nAmong what rushes will they build,\nBy what lakes edge or pool\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\nTo find they have flown away?\n\nW. B. Yeats is probably the last of the great Romantics, and the first of the \ngreat Modernists. He wrote a good number of truly great poems, and remains an \nessential poet of the highest rank. \nBut before long the relevance and acceptability of the traditional lyric in the modern age was questioned by modernists \nlike Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot \nand William Carlos Williams. Williams in particular rejected traditional meter \nand rhyme, while Pound and Eliot continued to write poetry that sounded \nsuspiciously familiar, albeit in a freer, more liberated manner. (Verse \nLibre means something like liberated verse.) \n\n\nThe Garden\nby Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\n\nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth.\n\nIn her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\nD. H. Lawrence was another modernist who wrote lyric poetry in a freer vein:\n\nPiano\nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nAfter World War II the proponents of New Criticism \nreturned to the lyric, advocating a poetry that made conventional use of rhyme, \nmeter and stanzas, and was modestly personal in the lyric tradition. Lyric \npoetry dealing with relationships, sex and domestic life constituted the new \nmainstream of American poetry in the late 20th century, and was influenced by the \nconfessional poets of the 1950s and 60s. They included Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton \nand Robert Lowell. Other exemplars of the post-war era include Louise Bogan, , \ne.e.cummings, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens ...\n\n\nin Just-by e. e. cummings\n\nin Just-\nspring when the world is mud-\nluscious the little\nlame baloonman\n\nwhistles far and wee\n\nand eddieandbill come\nrunning from marbles and\npiracies and it\'s\nspring\n\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\n\nthe queer\nold baloonman whistles\nfar and wee\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\n\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\nit\'s\nspring\nand\n\n the\ngoat-footed\n\nbaloonMan whistles\nfar\nand\nwee\n\nAcquainted With The Night \nby Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\n\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\n\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\n\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\n\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\n\nThe Snow Man\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\n\n\n    The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\n\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\n\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\n\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\n\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\n\n\nSong For The Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\n\nAfter the Persian\n\nby Louise Bogan\n\n\n\nI do not wish to know\nThe depths of your terrible jungle:\nFrom what nest your leopard leaps\nOr what sterile lianas are at once your serpents\' disguise and home.\n\nI am the dweller on the temperate threshold,\nThe strip of corn and vine,\nWhere all is translucence (the light!)\nLiquidity, and the sound of water.\nHere the days pass under shade\nAnd the nights have the waxing and the waning moon.\nHere the moths take flight at evening;\nHere at morning the dove whistles and the pigeons coo.\nHere, as night comes on, the fireflies wink and snap\nClose to the cool ground,\nShining in a profusion\nCelestial or marine.\n\nHere it is never wholly dark but always wholly green,\nAnd the day stains with what seems to be more than the\n sun\nWhat may be more than my flesh.\n\nII\n\nI have wept with the spring storm; \n\nBurned with the brutal summer.\nNow, hearing the wind and the twanging bow-strings,\nI know what winter brings.\n\nThe hunt sweeps out upon the plain\nAnd the garden darkens.\nThey will bring the trophies home\nTo bleed and perish\nBeside the trellis and the lattices,\nBeside the fountain, still flinging diamond water,\nBeside the pool\n(Which is eight-sided, like my heart).\n\nIII\n\nAll has been translated into treasure: \n\nWeightless as amber,\nTranslucent as the currant on the branch,\nDark as the rose\'s thorn.\n\nWhere is the shimmer of evil?\nThis is the shell\'s iridescence\nAnd the wild bird\'s wing.\n\nIV\n\nIgnorant, I took up my burden in the wilderness.\nWise with great wisdom, I shall lay it down upon flowers.\n\nV\n\nGoodbye, goodbye!\nThere was so much to love, I could not love it all;\nI could not love it enough.\n\nSome things I overlooked, and some I could not find.\nLet the crystal clasp them\nWhen you drink your wine, in autumn.\n\nIf you made it this far, I thank you for your time and attention, and I hope you \nwere hit by a few lightning bolts from out of the blue, along the way.\n\nOther Lyric Poems of Note\n\nThe poetic fragments of Sappho, composed for the lyre, hence lyrics\nLullaby by W.
