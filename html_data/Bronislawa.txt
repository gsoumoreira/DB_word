In \nthe summer of 1949, Jerzy Ficowski heard Papusza performing her \nsongs and, recognizing her talent, urged her to write them down as poems, so that he \ncould publish them. The song Tears of Blood (translated below) along with several others, was \npublished by Ficowski in the early 1950s in a book titledPieni Papuszi\n(Papusza\'s Songs). Unfortunately, Papusza\'s own people rejected her \npoetry, as one of her biographers explains:\n\nAmong the most powerful lyrics to emerge from the porraimos \n(Holocaust) were those composed by a young Polish Gypsy named Bronislawa Wajs, \nwho was known as Papusza, the Romani word for doll. Born sometime between \n1908 and 1910, she was raised as part of a great kumpania, a band \n[company] of families who traveled throughout Poland and Lithuania in \nhorse-drawn caravans until the mid-1960s when the Polish government, like most \nothers, put an end to their wandering life. The members of Papuszas family were \nharpists who, as Fonseca says, hauled their great stringed instruments upright \nover the wagons like sails. An unusual child, Papusza learned to read and write \nby stealing chickens in the villages where they stopped. She would bring the \nbirds to the literate locals in exchange for lessons and books, which she kept \nwell hidden, for when Papusza was growing up during the 1920s, literacy was \nalmost unheard of among the Gypsies; it was a gadjo practice and \ntherefore unclean.The Roma have strict purity lawsa \nrigid code of practices, rituals, and taboos that must be followed in order to \nmaintain cleanliness.Gadje and their habits and possessions are considered \nespecially unclean, mahrime, and therefore any Gypsy associating with \nthem for reasons besides trade or other unavoidable dealings is by extension \nmahrime, and subject to expulsion by the group. Whenever Papusza was caught \nreading she was beaten and her books were destroyed.But still she continued \n...\n\nThe Holocaust, or porraimos, as it has come to be called by the Roma, \nand which means the devouring, resulted in the \nmurders of more than 500,000 Gypsies (between one- and two-thirds of the total \nEuropean Gypsy population at that time). The devouring, to the Roma, meant not \nonly the genocide of their people, but also the continued denial of their \nsuffering, the longstanding international amnesia extending back through several \nhundred years of the enslavement, persecution, and exile of these travelers. But \nfor Papusza the horror of the devouring was to be followed by the rejection of \nher own people. Ostracized and fearing for her life, Papusza suffered a mental \nbreakdown and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. She never wrote again and \nlived the rest of her life in loneliness, rejected by the Rom community.\n\nThere is more biographical information about this \nfascinating poet and her tragic life below, but first let\'s read one of her poems ...\n\n\n\nTears of Blood\n\n(How we suffered under the German soldiers in Voly from 1943 to \n1944)\n\nIn the woods. No water, no fire  great hunger.\nWhere could the children sleep? No tent.\nWe could not light the fire at night.\nBy day, the smoke would alert the Germans.\nHow to live with children in the cold of winter?\nAll are barefoot\nWhen they wanted to murder us,\nfirst they forced us to hard labor.\nA German came to see us. \n I have bad news for you.\nThey want to kill you tonight.\nDont tell anybody.\nI too am a dark Gypsy,\nof your blood  a true one.\nGod help you\nin the black forest\nHaving said these words,\nhe embraced us all\n\nFor two three days no food.\nAll go to sleep hungry.\nUnable to sleep,\nthey stare at the stars\nGod, how beautiful it is to live!\nThe Germans will not let us\n\nAh, you, my little star!\nAt dawn you are large!\nBlind the Germans!\nConfuse them,\nlead them astray,\nso the Jewish and Gypsy child can live!\n\nWhen big winter comes,\nwhat will the Gypsy woman with a small child do?\nWhere will she find clothing?\nEverything is turning to rags.\nOne wants to die.\nNo one knows, only the sky,\nonly the river hears our lament.\nWhose eyes saw us as enemies?\nWhose mouth cursed us?\nDo not hear them, God.\nHear us!\nA cold night came,\nThe old Gypsy women sang\nA Gypsy fairy tale:\nGolden winter will come,\nsnow, like little stars,\nwill cover the earth, the hands.\nThe black eyes will freeze,\nthe hearts will die.\n\nSo much snow fell,\nit covered the road.\nOne could only see the Milky Way in the sky.\n\nOn such night of frost\na little daughter dies,\nand in four days\nmothers bury in the snow\nfour little sons.\nSun, without you, \nsee how a little Gypsy is dying from cold\nin the big forest.\n\nOnce, at home, the moon stood in the window,\ndidnt let me sleep. Someone looked inside.\nI asked  who is there?\n Open the door, my dark Gypsy.\nI saw a beautiful young Jewish girl,\nshivering from cold,\nasking for food.\nYou poor thing, my little one.\nI gave her bread, whatever I had, a shirt.\nWe both forgot that not far away\nwere the police.\nBut they didnt come that night.\n\nAll the birds \nare praying for our children,\nso the evil people, vipers, will not kill them.\nAh, fate!\nMy unlucky luck!\n\nSnow fell as thick as leaves,\nbarred our way,\nsuch heavy snow, it buried the cartwheels.\nOne had to trample a track,\npush the carts behind the horses.\n\nHow many miseries and hungers!\nHow many sorrows and roads!\nHow many sharp stones pierced our feet!\nHow many bullets flew by our ears!\n\nTranslated from the Polish by Yala Korwin.\n\n\nIn his foreword to Papusza\'s poetry, Ficowski quotes an excerpt from her autobiography:\n\nMy origin. My father came from theWarmiakclan, my mother fromGalician \nGypsies. On my father\'s side, we were a better family. I don\'t remember my \nfather too well; I was five years old when he died in Siberia. Eight years \nlater, my mother married Jan Wajs. I was my mother\'s only child Until I was \ntwelve, I couldn\'t read and write. I wanted to read and write so badly, but my \nfamily neglected me. My stepfather was a drunk and a gambler, and my mother had \nno idea what literacy was or that a child must learn. So how did I learn? I \nasked children who went to school to show me how to write letters. I always \nstole something and brought it to them so they would teach me, and so I learned \na b c d, and so on. \n\nNot far from us lived a Jewish shopkeeper. I stole a \nchicken and took it to her, and she taught me how to read in return. And then I \nbegan to read various books and newspapers. I can read well, but my writing is \nawful because I read a lot and didn\'t write much. And that has lasted all my \nlife till today. I\'m very proud of my knowledge, even if I didn\'t get it in \nschool. But life gave me education and knowledge. Then when I was thirteen years \nold, I was skinny and as nimble as a wood squirrel, only I was black. I read and \nGypsies laughed at me for that and they spat at me. They gossiped about me and, \nin defiance, I would read more and more. How many times did I cry, but just the \nsame I kept on doing what I wanted. I enrolled in the library and borrowed any \nbooks I could lay my hands on because I didn\'t know what was good and what \nwasn\'t. I asked my family to enroll me in school, but they couldn\'t have been \nless interested. \n\nPlease, you a Gypsy girl and you want to be a teacher? So I \nlet them alone and just went on reading and reading. \n\nOnce Gypsies were playing \nmusic on a farm by the river and my father took me with him. While they played, \nI read a book. Some woman came over to me and said, A Gypsy  and she can read! \nWell, that\'s nice. I burst out laughing but meanwhile I had tears in my eyes; \nshe inquired what and how and I told her about myself. She kissed me and went \naway, and then I read some more.\n\nPapusza married Dion\xfdz Wajs. He came from the same clan as her stepfather. The \nWajses traditionally earned money with their music; they were famous harp \nplayers. With their big, heavy harps they travelled in horse-drawn wagons and \nplayed wherever there was a demand for their music. Among their family \npossessions, Dion\xfdz Wajs\' family preserved a document showing that their \nancestors played in the court of the noblewoman Marysienka Sobieska.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out, and Roma Gypsies were being murdered in Poland  \nby German Nazis and Ukrainian fascists, they apparently chose to give up \ntheir carts and horses, but not their harps. With heavy harps on their backs, \nthey looked for hiding places in the woods. Ficowski tells the story of \nhow a harp saved the lives of Romani musicians from a group of Ukrainian \nfascists. One of the most daring Roma allegedly shouted, We\'ll shoot all of you \nwith this carbine. And apparently the bandits took fright and ran away.\n\nOf course, it wasn\'t that idyllic. According to Kenrick and Puxon, 35,000 Roma out of 50,000 were murdered during the war in Poland. \nTheWajsclan hid in the forest in Voly, hungry, cold and terrified. \nThis horrible \nexperience inspired Papusza to write her longest poem Ratfale jasfa  so pal \nsasendyr pegijam upre Voly 43 a 44 bera (Bloody tears  what we endured \nfrom German soldiers in Voly in \'43 and \'44).\n\nAccording to Ficovski, Papusza began to write down her songs \nin 1950, after World War II was over. \n\nAs is evident from her autobiography, her relatives did \nnot wish her to partake in such eccentric activities as reading and writing. \nThey made fun of her reading when she was a child and later they laughed at her \nwriting. The position of the community in which Papusza lived was that she \nshould not write. And so, despite all the encouragement of Jerzy Ficowski, there \nwere times when the poet didn\'t take her pen in hand.\n\nEven though Ficowski collected only thirty of Papusza\'s poems (some short, some \nepic and long), they are unique and enormously strong works of art in their \nauthenticity, absolute honesty, sincerity and originality drawn from nomadic \nlife under the protection of nature.\n\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
