His heroic life has inspired poets from many nations.The\npoems by  Wladyslaw Szlengel and Stefania\nNey, below, were written in Polish in the Warsaw Ghetto,\nwhere the writers perished. Antoni Slonimski, Jerzy Ficowski, and Anna Kamienska\nalso wrote in Polish; Zerubavel Gilead, Benjamin Tene, Anda Amir, and Aaron\nZeitlin wrote in Hebrew. Jiri Kondo founded the Janusz Korczak Society in Japan.\nThe translations, reproduced here with the kind permission of Ghetto Fighters\'\nHouse, were made from the Hebrew edition by Esther Cameron, except for Jiri\nKondo\'s haiku sequence (translator unknown). Jerzy Ficowski\'s\n8-5-43 also formed part of this collection; see Yala Korwin\'s\ntranslation from the Polish on the Jerzy\nFicowski page.\nAnd now, here are Yala Korwin\'s poetic tributes to Janusz Korczak: a sonnet\nentitled Ecce Homo (which seems quite fitting because we want our\nreaders to Behold the Man), and a poem entitled And Still They\nMarch, after which Esther Cameron\'s\ntranslations appear ...\n\n\n\n\nEcce Homo\nby Yala Korwin\n\nThe lives of great men are like legends difficult but beautiful,\nHersh Goldszmit/Janusz Korczak\n(1878-1942)\n\nHis life was difficult, but beautiful.\nOld Doctor  gifted penman, teacher, sage,\na Polish Jew with childlike soul so full\nof tenderness for those of tender age,\na father to the orphans in his care.\nThe wings of children, still so weak, should be,\nnot clipped, but groomed by love to cleave the air \nhis favorite maxim and his constant plea.\n\nThen  Hitlers war. The orphans lot was cast.\nHe went with them  a supreme sacrifice.\nThis noble lesson was to be his last:\nAll life is dear, but not at any price.\nHow hard to find the proper words that can\nconvey his life  Just this: Behold the Man.\n\n\n\nAnd Still They March\nby Yala Korwin\n\nThey march to the Umschlagplatz.\nThe doctor leads. Behind him\nthe tall Abrasha with the flag.\nOn its summer-meadow-green side\na spray of chestnut blossoms;\non the other side, brightest white,\na Star of David, blue.\nThen two hundred orphans,\noblivious to shouts and insults,\nmarch five abreast, singing,\nsinging joyous hiking songs.\nMiss Stefa, the housemother, follows,\nthe youngest in her arms.\n\nAnd still they march\nalong a path of cirrus clouds.\nTheir tatters smoothed, touched\nwith rainbow colors, glimmers\non weightless bodies changed\nto shimmers of celestial light.\nThey march, they march ...\n\n\n\nA Page from the Deportation Diary\nby  Wladyslaw Szlengel\n\nI saw Janusz Korczak today. He was walking\nat the head of his children in line.\nThey were dressed in clean clothes, as if for an outing\non Shabbat, when the weather\'s fine.\n\nThey wore their holiday jumpers  today\nif they\'re dirtied no one will scold \nas if through the woods the orphanage walked,\nfive by five, through the hunted crowd.\n\nThe pallid and trembling mass that moved\nthrough streets transfixed with dread,\nabove them the broken windows looked out\nempty as eyes of the dead.\n\nAnd now and then, like a funeral bell\nor a lost bird\'s call, rose a moan \nThe lords of the hour in their rickshaws rode,\ntheir faces hard as stone.\n\nFootfall and silence: the tramp of feet.\nVoices of those who from fear\nspeak swiftly. The church on Leszno Street\nstood frozen, dumbstruck in prayer.\n\nThe children walked quietly. No one came\nto free them. No one would buy,\nfor a few bills in a policeman\'s hand,\nthe orphans as they passed by.\n\nAt the square there was no intervention.\nNo one plucked Schmerling\'s sleeve and whispered,\nno one thought of collecting watches\nfor the Latvian reeking of liquor.\n\nBareheaded, with fearless eyes,\nJanusz Korczak walked on before.\nOne child held on by his pocket,\nAnd two in his arms he bore.\n\nSomeone came running, a paper in hand.\nExplained something, gestured: You\'ve got\na pass from Brandt, you can go home now, sir!\nJanusz Korczak had no use for that.\n\nTo the thick-headed bearer of Germany\'s boon\nhe did not attempt to explain\nwhat it is to abandon a child in distress \nsuch thoughts have no place in such brains.\n\nFor years he had cared for his children  it seemed\nhe gave them a new sun each day.\nHe had vowed to go with them to the end,\nhe must not turn back halfway.\n\nAnd little King Matty came to his mind\nwhose adventure he dreamed long ago \non the island among the savage tribes\nhe would have acted just so.\n\nThe children got into the boxcars, as if\nthey were going for a trip on Lag b\'Omer,\nand one little boy felt strong and brave \nit was his turn to be shomer*.\n* watchman (Hebrew/Yiddish)\n\nAnd I thought to myself, as I witnessed that scene\nwhich the eyes of Europe have missed,\nthat our history knows no more glorious man,\nno greater moment than this.\n\nIn the midst of a war that is sordid and vile,\nan abyss of corruption and shame,\nin a nightmare life where men sell their souls\nfor a few more weeks of the same,\n\nOn a front where no medals are handed out\nfor the combat with things of the night,\nJanusz Korczak, the orphans\' protector, stood,\nthe one soldier, strong and upright.\n\n\n\nHis Last Walk\nby Anda Amir\n\nWhere are we going? the children asked.\nHe walked ahead of them all,\nlooking as calm as if he were going\nout for a holiday stroll.\n\nWe\'re going to be free, he answered.\nSee, the gates are open wide.\nDon\'t cry  just sing! It\'s a holiday,\nand we\'re going, we\'re going outside!\n\nAnd the street unrolled like a carpet\nas the barefoot children walked past.\nSinging, We\'re going, and not alone,\nto the fields, the green fields at last.\n\nThe doctor is with us, he will not leave\nhis children. We\'re going together,\nand we know he\'ll go with us till the end,\nhe is with us now and forever.\n\n\n\nTo mend the world means: to reform education.\nJanusz Korczak, Confessions of a Butterfly\n\n\n\nOne hundred children are one hundred human beings.\nNot someday, not not yet, not tomorrow \nthey are human beings now.\nJanusz Korczak, How to Love a Child\n\n\n\nKorczak and the Kite Game\nby Zerubavel Gilead\n\nMy idea of playing with kites did not succeed...\nPerhaps I shall succeed yet.\nfrom a letter of Korczak\'s that reached Israel the day Word War II broke\nout\n\n An orange paper dragon pursues a red one\nand a yellow dragon triumphs over both \nno! there\'s not enough in that to fire the imagination\nand awaken joy and intoxication of the heart.\nFor you must know\nthat without breathlessness and pounding hearts\nplay is not play for children.\nI once grasped the hand of a child as he sailed\na toy boat on the river  his pulse was like the pulse\nof a malaria patient.\nPerhaps he felt like Magellan or Vasco da Gama\nand did not know he was really a new Columbus\ndiscovering his own America, there on the stream-bank\nin a remote village.\nThe light of the cigarette gleamed between his lips\nand he stopped to ask:\n\n Which way do the winds blow where you live,\nin the morning, in the evening?\nAnd does the wind usually come from the sea?\nOh, that\'s good, very good! Describe to me how\na kite flies in the wind today\nwith the thin string quivering in a child\'s fist\nflashing yellow and blue, deep blue,\nlike the one I saw once over the Gilboa\nwhen I visited your country.\nImagine:\na silent paper dragon in the twilight gloom\nand a red skyrocket above it \nthe children face to face are sending up stars\nand see, they reach up\nto the very heart of heaven!\nWhen I was four or five, I too\nused to send up kites, and when\nthe thread was cut my paper dragon flew off\nand was lost in the clouds.\nTears would fill my eyes\nand through the tears I would see angels\' wings\nhugging my kite.\nAnd now I\'m old, you know\nbut when I\'m feeling very bitter\nI close my eyes and see before me\npure-white wings in the clouds.\nThe cigarette stump went out.\nThe two of us were silent in the dark.\n\n\n\nKorczak\nSeven Haiku\nby Jiro Kondo\n\n1.\nFly, sparrows,\ntwitter the song of Krochmalna\n\n2\nCrying birds\nthat fell from the nest,\nI will rock your cradle\n\n3\nA star fell,\nfading into\nthe Warsaw night\n\n4\nThe cold echo\nof black boots\nsounds\nin the ghetto night\n\n5\nAlone with God\nin the tonguing fire\nof the seven flames\n\n6\nCry, wind,\nfor the dead children\nof Treblinka\n\n7\nSoft breeze, blow\nover the summer heath of Treblinka\na requiem\n\n\n\nA man has to know a lot and think a lot about himself,\nand even after doing so he is often mistaken\nand does not know everything.\nJanusz Korczak\n\n\n\nI don\'t wish harm to anyone. I can\'t I don\'t know how to.\nJanusz Korczak\n\n\n\nWhat unbearable dreams!\nYesterday: the Germans.\nI am in Praga without an armband, at a forbidden hour.\nI wake up. Another dream.\nIn the train I am brought to a cell, one meter square,\nin which there are already some Jews.\nTonight, again, people are dying. Bodies of children...\nI wake up, covered with sweat, at the most horrible moment.\nIs not death such an awakening, just when it seemed to you\nthat there was no way out?\n\nI haven\'t been paying visits.\nI\'ve been going around collecting money, food, information, advice,\ninstructions...\n...it is hard and humiliating work.\nAnd I have to put a good face on it,\nbecause people don\'t like sad faces...\nI returned from this expedition completely exhausted.\nJanusz Korczak, Ghetto Diary\n\n\n\n\nOn Janusz Korczak\nby Antoni Slonimski\n\nWhen, like a mourner when the mourning\'s past,\nwe tear the blackout curtains down at last,\nand all our light shall pour into the streets\nlike prisoners rushing out through opened gates,\na shout is in the tower, and church-bells ring\nso mightily as if the sound would fling\nitself forth from the belfry and, gone mad,\nwhirl with the masses turbulently glad;\nwhen all the city vibrates with one hymn\nand ghostly neon with its wintry glim\nfills the black letters and revives the signs,\nand neither fear nor modesty restrains\nthe multitudes embracing; tears of all,\naristocrats and paupers, mingled fall,\nthe thoroughfares a glittering parade,\nto celebrate the end of war, invades,\nboasting of our God-given victory \njoin not the crowd, cover with hand your eye!\nAnd if a burning tear that hand should feel,\nthen let the other grasp the warlike steel;\ngrasp your own fainting heart with a stern hand,\nsteadfast in grief. Look up from where you stand\nand see: another throng streams in procession here,\nabove the streets, a cloud of blood and tears,\nraining on flashing uniforms, waving flags,\nthese, weltering in blood and bound in rags,\nand frozen without motion, seem on high\nanother, ghostly army in the sky.\nNot of the starved, the slain are these the semblance,\nnor of the prisoners that died in torments,\nnor your own murdered kin: these signify\nthe souls of entire nations doomed to die.\nMany they are, in heaven and on earth,\nand if from black lips no speech issues forth,\nyet as a bloody shadow they sink down\nupon illumined Warsaw, London town;\nthe shouts are muted and the banners fade;\nthey come, with Janusz Korczak in the lead.\nThe doctor from the ghetto leads his orphans there,\nholding two in his arms, they cross the square.\nNo saint and martyr ever walked with firmer tread,\ntowards the gallows steps to join the dead.\nO soldier of the future overthrow! return\nto the vale of slaughter, where the fires forever burn:\nthe names of all those done to death here learn,\nraise them from common grave into eternity:\nthat not the demon-king remembered be,\nbut all the hearts that perished by his cruelty.\nAnd weep not over ruins, but study to tear down\nthe walls, the fortressed walls dividing man from man.\nNot the heroic flag and victory-sign you must\nexalt, but those humiliation brought to dust:\nraise them aloft, and in the firmament let stream\na banner where you trace the emblem of your dream:\na heart, whose crimson speaks\nof grief and shame and pain,\nwhile you go forth to pave new roads,\nto build the world again.\n\n\n\nJanusz Korczak\nby Bella Dizhur\n(fragment)\n\nIn front of the train the engine stands,\nbound for Treblinka. A wail of dread\nfrom a child breaks the hush.  This way!  Hard\nhand\nof a henchman lifted to count the heads,\ntwo hundred children, the dark, the blond,\ntwo hundred children who have not sinned \nWhat\'s in a number? Two hundred  each one\nhas a soul of his very own!\n\nTwo hundred souls  enigmas all.\nBlack-haired Devorah snuggles close.\nShe will be turned to ashes in hell.\nI don\'t want to go!  small arms are crossed\nround his neck  I\'m scared!  Two hundred such,\nand all are his, and all are lost.\nWhy must he still see, hear, and touch?\n\nAll is prepared, they are starting soon.\nOn the faces a darkness begins to descend.\nRound him a muted hubbub, a moan,\nhundreds of small, thin, trembling hands\nstretch toward him, his heart too is beating fast.\nThen like an electric lamp his face\nbegins to shine. A ray of its light\nreaches even the Fascist. Perplexed,\nforgetful, the man for one second delays\nto slam the door of the boxcar shut.\n\n\n\nJanusz Korczak\nby Aaron Zeitlin\n\nOn that day even God, they tell,\nin His secret heart had turned infidel.\nTo what purpose  he asked  did I create\nall the generations of the earth?\nThe heavenly Minister of Mirth\nfailed this time to dissipate\nthe sadness of God. (He used to read\naloud some philosophic screed\nfrom time to time, to entertain\nthe Lord with the nonsense it contained\nabout Him.) He had lost his faith\neven in His own existence. For,\nhe said, if I\'m here, how can this filth\nof the Nazis be? And round him fell\nsilence, darkness for evermore.\n\nJust then at Heaven\'s gate arrived\na certain doctor, after him\na crowd of children. Bright was their stride \nit lit the darkness like a hymn.\nAnd see: the horrors are past and gone\nas if they never happened at all.\nThe children are singing the very song\nthey sang in the cars, at the gates of hell,\nand with that song on their lips they rose\nupon clouds of smoke, till now on the roads\nof heaven they sing it and stride along.\n\nIt\'s a holiday step they keep  one, two, three!\nTo the land of summer, forever free!\nOne, two, three  to the land of sun,\ngladly we go toward the Light of the One,\ntoward eternal summer  one, two, three!\n\nThe doctor walked along in the lead.\nHis back was ever so slightly bent,\nbut his kind little eyes were radiant\nand his bit of greying yellow beard\nbobbed in the wind, keeping time as he\nsang, the old man  one, two, three!\nWe\'re alive  be fearless, everyone,\nthis is the way we walk toward the sun!\nAnd God borrowed a bit of gladness from them\nand said: Indeed, I eternally Am.\n\n\n\nA poet is someone who is very happy\nand very sorrowful,\nwho is quick to anger\nand who loves intensely,\nwho feels strongly,\nis easily stirred up,\nand who sympathizes with others\' feelings.\nChildren are like that too.\n\nA philosopher is someone who is very observant,\nwho ponders and wants to know\nhow things really are.\nChildren are like that too.\n\nIt is hard for children to say what they are feeling\nor what they are thinking about,\nbecause speech requires words.\nIt is still harder for them to write.\nBut children truly are philosophers and poets.\n\nThe land of the past which shall also be the land of the future.\nA land of plains and mountains,\nin which there are some mountains\nthat are comfortable and temperate, kind and forgiving,\nbut also some that are dark and threatening, dangerous and cruel.\nA land of desert and sea.\nA land of oranges,\nbut also of thorn and briar and thistle;\nof cool and pleasant breezes,\nbut also of burning hamsin winds.\nA land of skies that are clear by day\nand star-strewn by nights.\n\nIn the Land of Israel there are many stones...\nThere one must decipher and understand\nnot only the heavens, the wind, the tree, the wild grass...\nbut also the mountain  the stone and the star  the night.\nJanusz Korczak, notes from Eretz-Israel\n\n\n\nI do not yet know everything.\nBut the end of it will be that the Jews\nwill have their own state in the Land of Israel...\nJanusz Korczak, The Way I Think\n\n\n\nIf there is a land in which the child\nis forthrightly allowed\nhis dreams and anxieties\nhis longings and perplexities \nperhaps it is the Land of Israel.\nJanusz Korczak, from a letter to Yosef Arnon, 8/10/32\n\n\n\nIn Israel we must see ... the attempt to revive the land, the language,\nthe human being, his destiny and his faith.\nWhen I was borne aloft for the first time in an airplane, I felt something\nmore than astonishment, more than curiosity, pride or joy...\nThe predominant thought was this:\nOf all my ancestors not one, I am the first to be given this privilege,\nto fulfill the desire expressed in the prayer that is repeated every year:\nNext year in Jerusalem!\nWe have come to the borders of exile,\nreturned after two thousand years of wandering and persecutions.\nI was privileged to come here.\nJanusz Korczak, Notes and reflections, 1937\n\n\n\nDespite everything I believe in the future:\nof humanity, of the Jews, of the Land of Israel...\nIt is not myself I am trying to save, but my thoughts...\nI wish that tomorrow I could be sitting in my narrow little room in Jerusalem,\nin front of a Bible, some textbooks, a Hebrew dictionary, paper, pencil...\nso that I could say: A new leaf  final chapter.\nJanusz Korczak, from a letter to Moshe Zertal, 1937\n\n\n\nOn Janusz Korczak\nby Stefania Ney\n\nIf we take now the laughter of children and flowers,\nthe chuckle of bird and brook,\nthe smile of a doctor and poet  we\'ll make\na song about Janusz Korczak.\n\nA song of one man in a time of darkness,\nwhen the madness of hate ran wild \nhis heart was bright and his mind was clear,\nand he dearly loved each child.\n\nHis children, on whom their elders poured\ncursing and famine all day;\nfrom the cradle-bed to a victim\'s death\nthey dragged their brief, weary way.\n\nThey were driven along like scurvy dogs,\nblue, bloated, scarcely alive.\nAnd Janusz Korczak died for these,\nwho were old at the age of five.\n\nIt was not for his mother, his brother, he died,\nnor for God and the land of his birth,\nbut for children whom lice ate, most wretched and poor\nof all that lives on the earth.\n\nHe gave them his bread and his mind and his heart,\nshared their hunger, the dirt and the shame,\nand he died when children were killed because rogues\nhave not yet become like men.\n\n\n\nDr. Korczak\'s Deception\nby Anna Kamienska\n\nYou must admit, sir, that you deceived your children\nDr. Korczak, sir,\nyou deceived those two hundred children of yours,\nand then decided you might deceive them to the end\nright up to the ramp, you kept on whispering to them\nin the very ear of death the blessing of your deception\n\nBut really, sir, you couldn\'t have done otherwise\nbecause the truth had turned murderous\nand the enlightened world, from the word light \nwas already forbidden for children\nlike a cinema show that\'s too truthful\n\nActually the world had turned so and so many degrees\nuntil truth had become a lie\nand the lie that was supposed to have been the truth\nfound shelter with you, sir, in the Jewish Orphans\' Home\n\nProbably they guessed they sensed something\nsomething you would catch, sir,\nan uneasy look in their eyes,\nmaybe Moniush, or Abrasha, he\'s so quick\nlittle Mendel cried in his sleep\ntheir faces shone like the faces of old men\nlong ago sir you learned from the children how to die\n\nLook, Dr. Korczak, sir,\nthis is your writing\nthis is the holy book of the children\nthey come walking out of the new Bible\nlittle Romcia and Rachel and Ruth\nDavidek Zigmush Aron Yakubek\nfrom that book that Bible-land\nfrom that lie that was truth\nthey are always on their way\nwith a bundle\nwith the bread of famine\nbaked from the same bread\nfrom the same flesh\nfrom the same ancient blood\nfrom the same love\nfrom the same labor\nfrom the same burned tables of weight and height\nfrom the same suffering\nfrom the same wakefulness\nfrom the same death\n\nAnd here how quiet it is here\nafter their crying\nafter their screaming\nhow quiet they are\nthis is a slaughterhouse of children\nthis is earth this is earth\nDr. Korczak, sir\n\n\n\nGive me, O God, a hard life, but a rich and exalted one.\nJanusz Korczak, Ghetto Diary\n\n\n\nThis is something about which I have spoken and written many times,\nsomething for which I have been struggling for the past thirty years,\nfrom the time the orphanage was founded\nI have struggled without hope of victory,\nwithout evident results,\nbut I don\'t want to give up the struggle,\nI am incapable of giving up.\nI have been struggling to eliminate the distinctions in the orphanage\nbetween refined and coarse work,\nsmart and stupid work,\nclean and dirty work,\nwork for nice young ladies\nand work for the simple rabble.\nIn the orphanage there should be no exclusively mental or manual workers.\n\nThose who say work is dirty because it is physical are lying.\nIt is even worse when the hypocrite says, No work brings shame,\nbut himself chooses only the clean, white work and avoids the jobs\nthat are called dirty,\nand yet feels obligated to side with those who do the dirty jobs.\nJanusz Korczak, Ghetto Diary, July 27, 1942\n\n\n\nI set a deed (a brick) for the cornerstone of the building.\nI dug earth, planted a tree, drew water in a pitcher, drove in a nail,\nboiled milk, sewed on a button,\nwashed a shirt, polished a windowpane, put a child to bed, helped a friend.\nDrops of deeds;\nthe drops flow together into brooks \nthe deed that is realized is a jewel no one can steal.\nGreatness is perfection even in the most meager thing;\neven in the humblest tool  hammer, needle, pail and sickle.\nJanusz Korczak, The Harvest of Deeds\n\n\n\nThe Old Teacher\nby Moshe Bassok\n\nJust a little room in the city of peace,\nand paper and pencil, he asked,\nthe old teacher. That was his only wish,\nand he called it his last.\n\nOr no, one more thing he wished for, as shy\nas one of the children he loved:\none book where the words of Hebrew meet\nin a bridge of light from Aleph to Tav.\n\nThe grownups call it a dictionary,\nand some children think it must be dull.\nBut that is a very wise book. It has heard\ngenerations speak, and remembers it all.\n\nHe was almost ashamed to ask, being used\nonly to give. Perhaps he thought\nof asking to be a child once more;\nbut, old and wise, he said nothing of that.\n\nThe teacher, the teacher, they say, is gone.\nHe went with all his children. Oh, yes.\nIs he telling them stories? What stories are left\nTo tell? The old teacher, maybe, can guess.\n\n The room in the city of peace looks sad.\nOn the paper\'s shoulder the pencil cries.\nThey\'re orphans. They know he will never return \nperhaps he is looking at them from the skies?\n\nBut you, you words  come out of your book,\nsearch all the roads, ask every hill!\nStop, Hebrew words! Stand where you are,\nyou\'re the old teacher\'s grave in Israel.\n\n\n\nHis Last Walk\nby Benjamin Tene\n\nThe morning breezes dried his icy sweat,\nand all the houses that his steps had woken\nlooked after him and grieved him as he went\nfrom windows where no pane remained unbroken.\n\nThe sun that sought concealment in a cloud\nlooked like the yellow patch upon his breast.\nHis graying hair was gleaming like a crown;\nround his neck two orphans\' arms were laced.\n\nThe pavement seemed to groan beneath that load,\nthe morning seemed to stumble by his side\nwith face gone ashen and head held awry.\n\nBereft I am amid his grief and dark,\nyet one thing shines: the shepherd and his flock,\nthat road by which he led them forth to die.\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
