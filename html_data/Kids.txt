Awake! for the summer wind\nHath bidden the blossoms unclose,\nHath opened the violet\'s soft blue eye,\nAnd awakened the sleeping rose.\nAnd lightly they wave on their slender stems\nFragrant, and fresh, and fair,\nWaiting for us, as we singing come\nTo gather our honey-dew there.\nThen spread each wing,\nAnd work, and sing,\nThrough the long, bright sunny hours;\nO\'er the pleasant earth\nWe journey forth,\nFor a day among the flowers.\n\n\n\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat\nby Edward Lear\nI\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea\n In a beautiful pea green boat,\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money,\n Wrapped up in a five pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\n And sang to a small guitar,\n\'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,\n What a beautiful Pussy you are,\n You are,\n You are!\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are!\'\n\nII\nPussy said to the Owl, \'You elegant fowl!\n How charmingly sweet you sing!\nO let us be married! too long we have tarried:\n But what shall we do for a ring?\'\nThey sailed away, for a year and a day,\n To the land where the Bong-tree grows\nAnd there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood\n With a ring at the end of his nose,\n His nose,\n His nose,\nWith a ring at the end of his nose.\n\nIII\n\'Dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling\n Your ring?\' Said the Piggy, \'I will.\'\nSo they took it away, and were married next day\n By the Turkey who lives on the hill.\nThey dined on mince, and slices of quince,\n Which they ate with a runcible spoon;\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\n They danced by the light of the moon,\n The moon,\n The moon,\nThey danced by the light of the moon.\n\n\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod\nby Eugene Field\n\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod one night\nSailed off in a wooden shoe\x97\nSailed on a river of crystal light,\nInto a sea of dew.\nWhere are you going, and what do you wish?\nThe old moon asked the three.\nWe have come to fish for the herring fish\nThat live in this beautiful sea;\nNets of silver and gold have we!\nSaid Wynken,\nBlynken,\nAnd Nod.\nThe old moon laughed and sang a song,\nAs they rocked in the wooden shoe,\nAnd the wind that sped them all night long\nRuffled the waves of dew.\nThe little stars were the herring fish\nThat lived in that beautiful sea\x97\nNow cast your nets wherever you wish\x97\nNever afeard are we;\nSo cried the stars to the fishermen three:\nWynken,\nBlynken,\nAnd Nod.\nAll night long their nets they threw\nTo the stars in the twinkling foam\x97\nThen down from the skies came the wooden shoe,\nBringing the fishermen home;\n\'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed\nAs if it could not be,\nAnd some folks thought \'t was a dream they \'d dreamed\nOf sailing that beautiful sea\x97\nBut I shall name you the fishermen three:\nWynken,\nBlynken,\nAnd Nod.\nWynken and Blynken are two little eyes,\nAnd Nod is a little head,\nAnd the wooden shoe that sailed the skies\nIs a wee one\'s trundle-bed.\nSo shut your eyes while mother sings\nOf wonderful sights that be,\nAnd you shall see the beautiful things\nAs you rock in the misty sea,\nWhere the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:\nWynken,\nBlynken,\nAnd Nod.\n\n\nJabberwocky\nby Lewis Carroll\n\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nBeware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the manxome foe he sought \x97\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n\nAnd, has thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\'\nHe chortled in his joy.\n\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n\nThe Walrus and The Carpenter\nby\nLewis Carroll\n\nThe sun was shining on the sea,\nShining with all his might:\nHe did his very best to make\nThe billows smooth and bright\x97\nAnd this was odd, because it was\nThe middle of the night.\n\nThe moon was shining sulkily,\nBecause she thought the sun\nHad got no business to be there\nAfter the day was done\x97\nIt\'s very rude of him, she said,\nTo come and spoil the fun!\n\nThe sea was wet as wet could be,\nThe sands were dry as dry.\nYou could not see a cloud, because\nNo cloud was in the sky:\nNo birds were flying overhead\x97\nThere were no birds to fly.\n\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\nWere walking close at hand;\nThey wept like anything to see\nSuch quantities of sand:\nIf this were only cleared away,\nThey said, it would be grand!\n\nIf seven maids with seven mops\nSwept it for half a year.\nDo you suppose, the Walrus said,\nThat they could get it clear?\nI doubt it, said the Carpenter,\nAnd shed a bitter tear.\n\nO Oysters, come and walk with us!\nThe Walrus did beseech.\nA pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\nAlong the briny beach:\nWe cannot do with more than four,\nTo give a hand to each.\n\nThe eldest Oyster looked at him,\nBut never a word he said:\nThe eldest Oyster winked his eye,\nAnd shook his heavy head\x97\nMeaning to say he did not choose\nTo leave the oyster-bed.\n\nBut four young Oysters hurried up,\nAll eager for the treat:\nTheir coats were brushed, their faces washed,\nTheir shoes were clean and neat\x97\nAnd this was odd, because, you know,\nThey hadn\'t any feet.\n\nFour other Oysters followed them,\nAnd yet another four;\nAnd thick and fast they came at last,\nAnd more, and more, and more\x97\nAll hopping through the frothy waves,\nAnd scrambling to the shore.\n\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\nWalked on a mile or so,\nAnd then they rested on a rock\nConveniently low:\nAnd all the little Oysters stood\nAnd waited in a row.\n\nThe time has come, the Walrus said,\nTo talk of many things:\nOf shoes\x97and ships\x97and sealing-wax\x97\nOf cabbages\x97and kings\x97\nAnd why the sea is boiling hot\x97\nAnd whether pigs have wings.\n\nBut wait a bit, the Oysters cried,\nBefore we have our chat;\nFor some of us are out of breath,\nAnd all of us are fat!\nNo hurry! said the Carpenter.\nThey thanked him much for that.\n\nA loaf of bread, the Walrus said,\nIs what we chiefly need:\nPepper and vinegar besides\nAre very good indeed\x97\nNow if you\'re ready, Oysters dear,\nWe can begin to feed.\n\nBut not on us! the Oysters cried,\nTurning a little blue.\nAfter such kindness, that would be\nA dismal thing to do!\nThe night is fine, the Walrus said.\nDo you admire the view?\n\nIt was so kind of you to come!\nAnd you are very nice!\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\nCut us another slice:\nI wish you were not quite so deaf\x97\nI\'ve had to ask you twice!\n\nIt seems a shame, the Walrus said,\nTo play them such a trick,\nAfter we\'ve brought them out so far,\nAnd made them trot so quick!\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\nThe butter\'s spread too thick!\n\nI weep for you, the Walrus said:\nI deeply sympathize.\nWith sobs and tears he sorted out\nThose of the largest size,\nHolding his pocket-handkerchief\nBefore his streaming eyes.\n\nO Oysters, said the Carpenter,\nYou\'ve had a pleasant run!\nShall we be trotting home again?\'\nBut answer came there none\x97\nAnd this was scarcely odd, because\nThey\'d eaten every one.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe Highwayman\n\nby Alfred Noyes\n\nThe wind was a torrent of darkness among the \ngusty trees, \nThe moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, \nThe road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, \nAnd the highwayman came riding \n           Ridingriding \nThe highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door. \n\t\nHe\'d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his \nchin, \nA coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin; \nThey fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh! \nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle, \n           His pistol butts a-twinkle, \nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky. \n\t\nOver the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard, \nAnd he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and \nbarred; \nHe whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there \nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. \n\t\nAnd dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked \nWhere Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked; \nHis eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay, \nBut he loved the landlord\'s daughter, \n           The landlord\'s red-lipped daughter, \nDumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say \n\t\nOne kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I\'m after a prize to-night, \nBut I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; \nYet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day, \nThen look for me by moonlight, \n           Watch for me by moonlight, \nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way. \n\t\nHe rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand, \nBut she loosened her hair i\' the casement! His face burnt like a brand\n\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; \nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight, \n           (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!) \nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the \nWest. \n\t\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon; \nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon, \nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor, \nA red-coat troop came marching \n           Marchingmarching \nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door. \n\t\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, \nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow \nbed; \nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! \nThere was death at every window; \n           And hell at one dark window; \nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would \nride. \n\t\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest; \nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\n\nNow, keep good watch! and they kissed her. \n           She heard the dead man say \nLook for me by moonlight; \n           Watch for me by moonlight; \nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\n\n\t\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! \nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! \nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by \nlike years, \nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight, \n           Cold, on the stroke of midnight, \nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! \n\t\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\n\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast, \nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; \nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight; \n           Blank and bare in the moonlight; \nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s \nrefrain . \n\t\n Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs \nringing clear; \nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they \ndid not hear? \nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, \nThe highwayman came riding, \n           Riding, riding! \nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\n\n\t\n Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the \nechoing night! \nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! \nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, \nThen her finger moved in the moonlight, \n           Her musket shattered the moonlight, \nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death. \n\t\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood \nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\n\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear \nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \n           The landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness \nthere. \n\t\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, \nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\n\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet \ncoat, \nWhen they shot him down on the highway, \n           Down like a dog on the highway, \nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his \nthroat. \n\t\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the \ntrees, \nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, \nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, \nA highwayman comes riding \n           Ridingriding \nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.\n\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard; \nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred; \nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there \nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. \n\n\t\n\nYou Are Old, Father William\nby Lewis Carroll\n\nYou are old, Father William, the young man said,\nAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\x97\nDo you think, at your age age, it is right?\n\nIn my youth, Father William replied to his son,\nI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\'m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\n\nYou are old, said the youth,  as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back somersault in at the door\x97\nPray, what is the reason of that?\n\nIn my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\nI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\x97one shilling the box\x97\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\n\nYou are old, said the youth,  and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the back\x97\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\n\nIn my youth, said his father, I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\n\nYou are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was steady as ever;\nYet, you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\x97\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\n\nI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\nSaid his father. Don\'t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I\'ll kick you downstairs!\n\n\n\nThe Listeners \nby Walter De La Mare\n\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\nTo that voice from the world of men:\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\nLouder, and lifted his head:\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\nThough every word he spake\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\nFrom the one man left awake:\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\n\n\n\n\nin Just- by E.
