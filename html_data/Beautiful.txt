In one person\'s opinion, these are the most beautiful poems of all \r\ntime ... the utterly transcendent \r\nmasterpieces ...\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\npass into nothingness ...\r\nJohn Keats\r\n\r\nWhich is the most beautiful poem of all? Only \r\nyou, the reader, can ultimately decide, but I hope to present some worthy candidates for \r\nyour consideration.\r\nI have selected the poems on this page strictly for the beauty of their words \r\nand images; there may be other poems that are more philosophical, more \r\ninnovative, etc., but in my opinion there is something utterly captivatingsomething \r\ntranscendentabout beauty. It can be refreshing to put aside all \r\nother criteria and simply contemplate those poems most likely to be a joy \r\nforever. The most beautiful poems in the English language, \r\nfor me, \r\ninclude: Go, Lovely Rose by \r\nEdmund Waller, Sweet Rose of Virtue by William Dunbar, A Red, Red Rose by \r\nRobert Burns, The Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy, Dover Beach by Matthew \r\nArnold, Song for the Last Act by Louise Bogan, To Earthward by Robert Frost, \r\nVoyages by Hart Crane, Piano by D. H. Lawrence, Cradle Song by William \r\nBlake, Lullaby by W. H. Auden, Bread and Music by Conrad Aiken, Sunday \r\nMorning by Wallace Stevens, Those Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden, \r\nRequiescat by Oscar Wilde, Elegy Written in a Country Courtyard by \r\nThomas Gray and The Wild Swans at Coole by W. B. Yeats. \r\n\r\nHere you will also find magnificent poems by William Shakespeare, Edmund \r\nSpenser, Emily \r\nDickinson, Walt Whitman, e. e. cummings, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Dylan Thomas, Sir \r\nThomas Wyatt, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Ernest Dowson, \r\nT. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick,  \r\nGerard Manley Hopkins, John Donne, Lord Byron, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth. There are also \r\nEnglish translations of poems by Sappho of Lesbos, the Bible\'s King Solomon, \r\nHafiz, Pablo Neruda and Pierre Ronsard.And \r\nbecause most hit songs are lyric poems set to music, I have also included \r\nthe work of songwriters like Joan Baez, Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Michael Jackson, \r\nJohn Lennon, Carole King, Prince, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and Bruce \r\nSpringsteen.\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to entice or impress that special someone we have a collection \r\nof free love poems that you can choose from, at\r\n\r\nLove Poems for the Ages. There are no fees, no ads and no gimmicks of any \r\nkind. We remain fans of the days when things were actually free on the Internet, \r\nand what is a better and more personal gift than beautiful poetry?\r\n\r\nOn a much more somber note, we have a new page of poems from around the globe:\r\nPoems for the Victims and Survivors of the \r\nCoronavirus\r\n\r\ncompiled \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos is the first great female poet still known to us today, \r\nand she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. \r\nShe is so revered for her erotic love poetry that we get our terms sapphic and \r\nlesbian from her name and island of residence. Furthermore, as you can see from the two stellar epigrams \r\nbelow, she remains a timeless treasure:\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 155\r\ntranslation byMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA short revealing frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \r\nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \r\nproper and violently homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \r\nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous for his \r\ndisdain for dull and dulling conformity, as his witty epigrams attest. But this \r\nlovely, wonderfully moving elegy he wrote for his sister \r\nIsola, who died at age ten, proves that he was a true poet \r\ncapable of \r\ncreating timeless art. \r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats is the most famous Irish poet and his \r\npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne \r\nhave help preserve her memory. The first poem below is \r\na \r\nloose translation of a Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \r\nlife in her later years, tending a fire. The second poem, The Wild Swans \r\nat Coole, is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar was one of the first great Scottish poets, and is perhaps best known for \r\nhis poem Lament for the Makiris (Lament for the Makers, or Poets). \r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \r\n\r\nFelicia Hemans was a child prodigy who had her first book \r\nof poems published at age fourteen. She corresponded with Percy Bysshe Shelley \r\nand was praised in poetic tributes by William Wordsworth and Walter Savage \r\nLandor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is in all this cold and hollow world, \r\nno fount of deep, strong, deathless love: \r\nsave that within a mother\'s heart.\r\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans Browne \r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley (below) and Felicia Hemans (above) were born a year \r\naparthe in August 1792, she in September 1793. They look enough alike to be \r\nbrother and sister. They were both poets, both child prodigies, and they \r\ncorresponded after Hemans had her first book of poems published. Here is one especially lovely example of \r\nShelley\'s \r\nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\nThe next poem is interesting not only because it\'s lovely and touching, but \r\nbecause the poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of \r\nAlgernon Charles Swinburne. And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to \r\nEnglish poetry, adapting it from the French rondeau. You can learn more \r\nabout Kevin Roberts and read more of his poems by clicking his hyperlinked name. \r\n\r\nRondel\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nPablo Neruda may have been the best love poet of modern times ...\r\n\r\nEvery Day You Play\r\nby Pablo Neruda \r\nloose\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEvery day you play with Infinitys rays. \r\nExquisite visitor, you arrive with the flowers and the water. \r\nYou are vastly more than this immaculate head I clasp tightly \r\nlike a cornucopia, every day, between my hands ... \r\n\r\nHafiz is one of the more appealing love poets among the ancients ...\r\n\r\nInfectious!\r\nby Hafiz aka Hafez\r\nloose translation byMichael \r\nR. Burch \r\n\r\nI became infected with happiness tonight \r\nas I wandered idly, singing in the starlight. \r\nNow I\'m wonderfully contagious \r\nso kiss me! \r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \r\nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is one of the best villanelles in the English \r\nlanguage, and it remains one of the most powerful, haunting poems ever \r\nwritten in any language. \r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. As far as we know, she had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nHere is a printable version of\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye\'s Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep which is not \r\ncopyrighted and is thus in the public domain. \r\n\r\nEdward Thomas is not as well-known as some of the other poets on this page, but \r\nAdlestrop was among the top ten most requested poems at Poetry Please, \r\nso he continues to have fans. Adlestrop is a somewhat mysterious poem, because \r\nnothing really happens and yet it seems extraordinarily sad.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdlestrop\r\nbyEdward Thomas\r\n\r\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\r\nThe name, because one afternoon\r\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\r\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\r\n\r\nThe steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\r\nNo one left and no one came\r\nOn the bare platform. What I saw\r\nWas Adlestroponly the name\r\n\r\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\r\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\r\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\r\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\r\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\r\nFarther and farther, all the birds\r\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was an English romantic poet, painter, illustrator \r\nand translator. He was also one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite \r\nBrotherhood. His art was characterized by sensuality and medieval revivalism. In \r\n1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal (pictured above), who became his model, his \r\npassion, and eventually in 1860, his wife.\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nI have been here before,\r\n\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\n\r\nThe sweet keen smell,\r\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore. \r\nYou have been mine before,\r\n\r\nHow long ago I may not know:\r\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\r\n\r\nYour neck turned so,\r\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore. \r\nHas this been thus before?\r\n\r\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\r\nStill with our lives our love restore\r\n\r\nIn death\'s despite,\r\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more? \r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti\'s sister Christina was also a poet, and perhaps the \r\nbetter of the two. \r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nWould it surprise you to know that one of the most beautiful (and saddest) poems \r\nin the English language was written by a child prodigy, Thomas Chatterton? \r\nAlthough his mother and family considered him to be slow, around age seven the \r\nyoung Chatterton discovered an ancient book with illuminated capital letters, \r\nand he suddenly became intensely interested, quickly learned to read, and then \r\nbegan writing poems! By age ten he was a published poet. But many of the poems \r\nhe wrote were in a medieval version of English, and no one would believe that a \r\nchild was capable of writing such poems. So he pretended to have found the \r\npoems of an ancient monk named Thomas Rowley. One thing led to another, and \r\nChatterton was accused of being a forger even though the poems were his \r\noriginal compositions! Spurned by stuffy literary types and unable to support \r\nhimself, but too proud to accept handouts, Chatterton committed suicide at age \r\n17. You can click on his hyperlinked name above to read the sad, lovely ballad \r\nbelow, and other poems that he wrote during his short, tortured life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong from \xc6lla: Under the Willow Tree, or, Minstrel\'s Roundelay\r\nby\r\n\r\nThomas Chatterton\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSee! the white moon shines on high; \r\nWhiter is my true-love\'s shroud:\r\nWhiter than the morning sky, \r\nWhiter than the evening cloud: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt has been credited with introducing the \r\nPetrarchan sonnet into the English language. Wyatt\'s father had been one of Henry \r\nVII\'s Privy Councilors and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII came to \r\nthe throne in 1509. Wyatt followed his father to court, but it seems the \r\nyoung poet may have fallen in love with the kings mistress, \r\nAnne Boleyn. Their acquaintance is certain, although whether or not the two \r\nactually shared a romantic relationship remains unknown. But in his poetry, Wyatt called \r\nhis mistress Anna and there do seem to be correspondences. For instance, this poem might well have been written \r\nabout the Kings claim on Anne Boleyn: \r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\r\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. So perhaps after her betrothal to Henry, religious vows  \r\nentered into the picture, and left Wyatt out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElinor Wylie was famous during her life almost as much for her ethereal beauty \r\nand personality as for her melodious, sensuous poetry.\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\n\r\nConrad Aiken was one of the sweetest singers among American poets. \r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels, which include the \r\nthen-infamous Lady Chatterley\'s Lover, but he was one of the better \r\nearly modernist poets. \r\n\r\nPiano \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first and best of the modern confessional poets. She \r\nwon a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\r\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \r\npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life.\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\r\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\r\n\r\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\r\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\r\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\r\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\r\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\r\n\r\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\r\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\r\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\r\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\r\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \r\npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \r\nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \r\nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \r\nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \r\nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, \r\nmasturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. \r\nThe Truth the Dead Know\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\r\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\r\n\r\nGone, I say and walk from church,\r\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\r\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\r\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\r\n\r\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\r\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\r\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\r\nand we touch. In another country people die.\r\n\r\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\r\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\r\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\r\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\r\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\r\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\r\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \r\nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \r\nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \r\nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \r\nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \r\nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \r\nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \r\ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) \r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\r\nI shall remember you with love, or season\r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\n\r\nThere are more poems by Edna St. Vincent Millay later on this page.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson was the first great female American poet. \r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowlyEden\r\nLips unused to thee\r\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\r\nAs the fainting bee\r\n\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums\r\nCounts his nectarsalights\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose\r\nby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nVIII from Sunday Morning\r\n\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\r\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\r\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\r\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\r\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\r\nOr old despondency of day and night,\r\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\r\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\r\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\r\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\r\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\r\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\r\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\r\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\r\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong for the Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W.

We are grown,\r\nand time has thrown us free under the timeless moon.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man \r\nby \r\nWallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby T.

He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\nTo Earthward\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\nDepths\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nOnce more home is a strange place: by the ocean a\r\nbig house now, and the small houses are memories,\r\n once live images, vacant\r\n thoughts here, sinking and vanishing.\r\n\r\nRough sea now on the shore thundering brokenly\r\ndraws back stones with a roar out into quiet and\r\n far depths, darkly to lie there\r\n years, yearsthere not a sound from them.\r\n\r\nNew waves out of the night\'s mist and obscurity\r\nlunge up high on the beach, spending their energy,\r\n each wave angrily dying,\r\n all shapes endlessly altering,\r\n\r\nyet out there in the depths nothing is modified.\r\nEarthquakes won\'t even moveno, nor the hurricane\r\n one stone there, nor a glance of\r\n sun\'s light stir its identity.\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nCradle Song\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\nTears, Idle Tears\r\nby Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\r\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\nSad as the last which reddens over one\r\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nAh, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\r\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nDear as remembered kisses after death,\r\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\r\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nThe Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\ndom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\nOf the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\nAs a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\nRebuffed the big wind.

AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\nNo wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\nFall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\nThe Convergence Of The Twainby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nLines on the loss of the Titanic\r\n\r\nIn a solitude of the sea\r\nDeep from human vanity,\r\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\r\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\r\nOf her salamandrine fires,\r\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\r\nOver the mirrors meant\r\nTo glass the opulent\r\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\r\nJewels in joy designed\r\n To ravish the sensuous mind\r\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\r\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\r\n Gaze at the gilded gear\r\nAnd query: What does this vaingloriousness down here?...\r\nWell: while was fashioning\r\n This creature of cleaving wing,\r\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\r\n Prepared a sinister mate\r\n For herso gaily great\r\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\r\n And as the smart ship grew\r\n In stature, grace, and hue,\r\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\r\n Alien they seemed to be;\r\n No mortal eye could see\r\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\r\n Or sign that they were bent\r\n By paths coincident\r\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\r\n Till the Spinner of the Years\r\n Said Now! And each one hears,\r\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nComposed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802by\r\nWilliam Wordsworth\r\n\r\nEarth has not anything to show more fair:\r\nDull would he be of soul who could pass by\r\nA sight so touching in its majesty:\r\nThis City now doth, like a garment, wear\r\nThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\r\nShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\r\nOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;\r\nAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.\r\nNever did sun more beautifully steep\r\nIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;\r\nNe\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\r\nThe river glideth at his own sweet will:\r\nDear God! the very houses seem asleep;\r\nAnd all that mighty heart is lying still!\r\n\r\nSong of Solomon\r\nattributed to King Solomon\r\n\r\nI am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\nAs the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\nAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.\r\nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\nHe brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.\r\nStay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.\r\nHis left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.\r\nI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,\r\nand by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon Julia\'s Clothes \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nWhenas in silks my Julia goes,\r\nThen, then, methinks, how sweetly flows\r\nThe liquefaction of her clothes.\r\n\r\nNext, when I cast mine eyes and see\r\nThat brave vibration each way free,\r\nOh, how that glittering taketh me!\r\n\r\nSpring Song\r\n\r\nby Lucy Maud Montgomery\r\n\r\n\r\nHark, I hear a robin calling!\r\nList, the wind is from the south!\r\nAnd the orchard-bloom is falling\r\nSweet as kisses on the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the dreamy vale of beeches\r\nFair and faint is woven mist,\r\nAnd the river\'s orient reaches\r\nAre the palest amethyst.\r\n\r\nEvery limpid brook is singing\r\nOf the lure of April days;\r\nEvery piney glen is ringing\r\nWith the maddest roundelays.\r\n\r\nCome and let us seek together\r\nSpringtime lore of daffodils,\r\nGiving to the golden weather\r\nGreeting on the sun-warm hills.\r\n\r\nSpring\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nTo what purpose, April, do you return again?\r\nBeauty is not enough.\r\nYou can no longer quiet me with the redness\r\nOf little leaves opening stickily.\r\nI know what I know.\r\nThe sun is hot on my neck as I observe\r\nThe spikes of the crocus.\r\nThe smell of the earth is good.\r\nIt is apparent that there is no death.\r\nBut what does that signify?\r\nNot only under ground are the brains of men\r\nEaten by maggots.\r\nLife in itself\r\nIs nothing,\r\nAn empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.\r\nIt is not enough that yearly, down this hill,\r\nApril\r\nComes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.\r\n\r\nDirge Without Music\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.\r\nSo it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:\r\nInto the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned\r\nWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.\r\n\r\nLovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.\r\nBe one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.\r\nA fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,\r\nA formula, a phrase remains,but the best is lost.\r\n\r\nThe answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\r\nThey are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled\r\nIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not \r\napprove.\r\nMore precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.\r\n\r\nDown, down, down into the darkness of the grave\r\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;\r\nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.\r\nI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\r\n\r\nSong of a Second April\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nApril this year, not otherwise\r\n Than April of a year ago,\r\nIs full of whispers, full of sighs,\r\n Of dazzling mud and dingy snow;\r\n Hepaticas that pleased you so\r\nAre here again, and butterflies.\r\n\r\nThere rings a hammering all day,\r\n And shingles lie about the doors;\r\nIn orchards near and far away\r\n The grey wood-pecker taps and bores;\r\n The men are merry at their chores,\r\nAnd children earnest at their play.\r\n\r\nThe larger streams run still and deep,\r\n Noisy and swift the small brooks run\r\nAmong the mullein stalks the sheep\r\n Go up the hillside in the sun,\r\n Pensively,only you are gone,\r\nYou that alone I cared to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo continue reading more of the most beautiful poems of all time, \r\nplease click here: Poems \r\nby the Masters of English Poetry. \r\n\r\nOther notable beautiful poems and songs of the English language include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush \r\nby Thomas Hardy\r\nDover Beach by Matthew Arnold\r\nThey Flee from Me that Sometime Did Me Seek by Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\nOde: Intimations of Immortality by William Wordsworth\r\nElegy Written in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray\r\nThe Tide Rises, the Tide Falls by Henry Wadsworth \r\nLongfellow\r\nA Psalm of Life by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\nThe Highwayman\r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\nAfter the Persian by Louise Bogan\r\nVoyages by Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgetfulness by Hart Crane\r\n\r\nA Last Word by Ernest Dowson\r\nThe Old Lutheran Bells at Home by Wallace Stevens\r\nThe Idea of Order at Key West by Wallace Stevens\r\nTea at the Palace of Hoon by Wallace Stevens\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\nFern Hill by Dylan Thomas\r\nAnd Death Shall Have No Dominion by Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nSarabande On Attaining The Age Of Seventy-Seven\r\nby Anthony Hecht\r\nExile by Hart Crane\r\nTime in Eternity by T.
