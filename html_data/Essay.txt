(the continuing bias against formal poetry)\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThis is a true story. The names of the journals have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent.\r\n\r\nIn my advancing age, I seldom submit poems for publication unless I know the \r\njournals and their editors. But every now and then, I decide to take a chance. \r\nWhen I do, strange things can happen. For instance, in recent years I\'ve had poems rejected by \r\neditors who said:\r\n\r\nI do believe your poems are fine, even beautiful ...\r\nYour poetry is evocative, but not what we\'re looking for ...\r\nYour poems are wonderful, but not right for us ...\r\netc.\r\n\r\nDrats, another rejection slip! But was the slip-up mine, or the editor\'s? I probably shouldn\'t complain, \r\nsince I\'ve been published widely in literary \r\njournals and sundry publications around the globe. Lately some of my poems have \r\nbeen going viral, as people cut and paste them to blogs and other \r\nwebsites. It seems some people like my poems \r\nenough to borrow them, and I find it pleasing and gratifying when they do. But \r\nI still find myself a bit irked when editors who should know \r\nwhat to do with good poems (publish them!) tell me that my poetry is \r\nwonderful but not right for us. How can \r\npoems be wonderful but not right?\r\n\r\nMy \r\nliterary Spidey sense tells me that I\'m the victim of pseudo-intellectual snobbery. What I suspect \r\ncertain editors are telling me, in a weird sort of Morse code, is: I really like \r\nand admire your poems, but if I publish them people may no \r\nlonger consider me to be the \xfcber-reader that I want them to believe I am, so I\'ll have to pass \r\nin order to keeping projecting my desired image.\r\n\r\nBeing a poetry editor myself, I believe I understand the most basic function of poetry \r\neditors everywhere, which is to publish the best possible poetry that meets their stated guidelines. So, for example, if a journal publishes only haiku, \r\nany poetry submitted \r\nmust fit the editor\'s definition of haiku while being worthy of \r\npublication in his/her opinion.I would certainly have no objection if the \r\neditor of a haiku journal rejected my submission of a sonnet. Indeed, I would have been foolhardy \r\nto submit a sonnet to, let\'s say, Haiku Heaven. But what about a  \r\njournal whose guidelines say\r\nthat it includes all fronts of poetry with as little bias as possible. \r\nI might expect to be published if the editor of this journallet\'s call \r\nit Biasless Schizophrenic, or BS for shortfound my poems to be fine, \r\neven beautiful. Alas, this was not the case, and I fear it\'s because some \r\neditors still consider poems that employ meter and rhyme to automatically \r\nbe archaic. But if this was the case, most popular songs and \r\nmany TV jingles would be automatically archaic. Since Mick Jaggar and Eminem are \r\nnot considered to be antiquarians, I disagree that such a strange, unjust \r\nmeasure should be \r\napplied to poets. And because my best poems are written in grammatically correct \r\nmodern English, I take issue with what seems to be a knee-jerk reaction against \r\nrhymed metrical poetry. Here are some excerpts from the BS rejection missive I \r\nreceived:\r\nMike, Thanks for your response to my editorial spewings ... and thanks as well for the additional submissions. \r\nReturning now to your workthe larger volume of pieces to reviewit comes to \r\nme that there is simply a stylistic difference here, with no real argument \r\n... My own taste is toward a more decidedly \r\nmodern or current speech usage in poems, a poetry that may still be beautiful \r\nbut perhaps not in the same ways that it has been in previous times. I imagine \r\nyou might actually do well to submit to more classically leaning journals like\r\nPoetry. Perhaps it\'s my oddball aesthetic philosophy at work here. In any event, \r\nI do believe your poems are fine, even beautiful, and no sense splitting hairs \r\nover phrases. It\'s just that these aren\'t fitting into the evolving collection \r\nas I see it, and I am sorry not to be inviting you to include your work in this paticular \r\n[sic] issue of BS. I believe at present I\'ll be guest/contributing editor just \r\nthis one time for now, so things are always changing ... Anyway, thanks again, \r\nand may the Muse be with you!\r\n\r\nI will let the reader judge whether the work I submitted was written in \r\nanything other than good modern English. Here are two examples:\r\n\r\nSee\r\nSee how her hair has thinned: it doesn\'t seem\r\nlike hair at all, but like the airy moult\r\nof emus who outraced the wind and left\r\nsoft plumage in their wake. See how her eyes\r\nare gentler now; see how each wrinkle laughs,\r\nand deepens on itself, as though mirth took\r\nsome comfort there and burrowed deeply in,\r\noutlasting winter. See how very thin\r\nher features arethat time has made more spare,\r\nso that each bone shows elegant and rare.\r\nFor loveliness remains in her grave eyes,\r\nand courage in her still-delighted looks:\r\neach face presented like a picture books.\r\nBemused, she blows us undismayed goodbyes.\r\nViolets\r\nOnce, only once,\r\nwhen the wind flicked your skirt\r\nto an indiscreet height\r\nand you laughed,\r\nabruptly demure,\r\noutblushing shocked violets,\r\nsuddenly,\r\nI knew:\r\neverything had changed . . .\r\nand as you braided your hair\r\ninto long bluish plaits\r\nthe shadows empurpled,\r\nthe dragonflies\r\nlast darting feints\r\ndissolving mid-air . . .\r\nwe watched the suns long glide\r\ninto evening,\r\nknowing and unknowing . . .\r\nO, how the illusions of love\r\nawait us in the commonplace\r\nand rare\r\nand haunt our small remainder of hours.\r\nReader Reaction:\r\n\r\nWith regard to those two wonderful poems of yours that the BS \r\npublisher refused, all I can say is that having them on THT is our \r\ngain and his loss.Both poems are exquisite. The first, See,brought tears to \r\nmy eyes and an aching to my heart as I remembered my grandmother, my mother, and \r\nnow myself trying to approach old age with courage and bemusement.The stanza: \r\nsuddenly/I knew:/everything had changed in the other poem, Violets, \r\nis so transcendent, so universal, that, regardless of the fact that my\r\nmoment had nothing to do with violets and everything to do with football, \r\nit made me feel again like that 15-year-old girl whose illusion of love was born \r\non an unremarkable Friday night in 1965.Catherine Chandler\r\n\r\nI also, by the way, particularly like the closing lines of your opening poem: \r\nO, how the illusions of love...haunt our small remainder of hours. I think \r\nthose lines are excellent.Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nSee is quite extraordinary!Zyskandar Jaimot\r\nI liked both [poems] a lot, especially See for its extraordinary \r\ndelicacy.Richard Moore\r\nSee is very lovely, the elegant and spare portrait, with all that emu \r\nfluff and burrowing mirth.Marly Youmans\r\nExquisite!Esther Cameron\r\nThis poem [See] is very clear, very simple, very loving, keeps the reader \r\nabreastand charmedand the language as well as the meaning flows smoothly from \r\nbeginning to end. And the end is lovely. A very nice one, my compliments.Tom \r\nMerrill\r\nGreat news [about See and At Wilfred Owens Grave finishing 3rd and 7th \r\nin the 2003 Writers Digest Rhyming Poetry Contest] and a worthy recognition for \r\nyour beautiful poetic touch.Chesil, editor of Poetry Webring\r\nMy sincere compliments to Mike Burch on his award-winning poems, See and \r\nAt Wilfred Owens\' Grave, which seem to me deep, qualified, interesting, and \r\nwell crafted. I found See particularly touchingrarely does one come upon so \r\nperceptive a portrayal of old ageand At Wilfred Owen\'s Grave becomes a \r\nclarion battle cry. For a better day. Clearly, these two poems deserve repeated \r\nand frequent rereading. Many thanks for letting me see them.Rhoda Bandler in a \r\nletter to Yala Korwin\r\nRarely does one come upon so sensitive and sympathetic a portrayal of old age \r\n... poems about old age express often pity, derision, even revulsion. Yours is a \r\nlovely portrait, not a caricature.Yala Korwin\r\nSee is a marvelous poem.Greg Brownderville\r\nThis, Michael, is nearly faultless. I can\'t advance a single reservation as \r\nto its diction, meter or general execution. One senses that you accomplished \r\nprecisely what you set out to do. From see how each wrinkle laughs until and \r\ncourage in her still-delighted looks, your individual style and sensibility \r\ntruly shine. A great poem.Jeffrey Woodward\r\nOh these are so beautiful. Like you I still believe that love is what matters \r\nand your poems glow with it. I\'m old enough to be deeply moved by \'See\'. How \r\nstrange that a comparative child and an old poet like me should see the world \r\nthe same way and how grateful I am to you for crystallising the link.Janet \r\nKenny, poet, opera singer and peace activist\r\nMy many thanks for the opportunity to read Mr. Burch\'s two poems you sent. I \r\nhave read them many timeseach reading a further revelation of his sensitivity \r\nand word usage to convey each separate poem in each separate tone. To break down \r\nthe flavor of each this follows: SEE. This poem is a tender paean to an elderly, \r\nlovely woman. It is so full of love without actually saying it, and that in \r\nitself is intrinsic to its tug of the reader\'s heart. It presents a vivid \r\npicture of the gallantry and courage of the aging. I quote a few lines that I \r\nfound unforgettable: see how her eyes are gentler now. So sure in youth but \r\nquieter with the acquiring of a certain wisdom. The image of wrinkles: burrowed \r\ndeeply in, outlasting winter leaves a mark on the uncritical mind, that accepts \r\nand sees the beauty carved by life. AT WILFRED OWEN\'S GRAVE. Thoughts of war and \r\ndeath in the years of youth can bring nothing but an ache in the heart. This \r\npoem presents it with perfect pitch. The use of language to depict the horrors \r\nof war without saying the word horror, but by describing existing in its midst, \r\ntrying to survive, yet almost surely knowing survival would be a miracle, that \r\ndeath in wars denies life to the ordinary unsung as much as to the gifted cut \r\nshort untimely, fighting side by side. These are boys lived by family and \r\nfriends no matter what status in society. This poem is almost a painting using \r\nwords instead of oils to depict murder while the initiators stay home mouthing \r\nphrases of patriotism. Yala, I hope I\'m not too wordy. I am deeply affected by \r\nboth poems.Emma Landau, in a letter to Yala Korwin\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion\r\n\r\nThese are the thoughts of accomplished poets who care deeply about poetry, so \r\nit\'s hard for me to understand why the poems they admired would be rejected, \r\nespecially when the editors who rejected the poems called them fine, beautiful, \r\nevocative, etc.\r\nIt\'s also hard for me to understand why an editor whose guidelines welcome all forms \r\nof poetry would reject poems he considered fine, even beautiful on the grounds \r\nthat he wanted something decidedly more modern, when both poems are written in \r\nperfectly good modern English. Perhaps the editor was afraid someone might \r\nthink he wasn\'t sufficiently sophisticated if he published rhyming poems that \r\nconvey a good deal of sentiment. But of course some of the best poems of all \r\ntime are rhyming poems that convey sentiment. I think the editor of BS is full \r\nof BS. I also believe that a bias against formal poetry has resulted in many\r\npoems other than mine \r\nbeing banished to the back of the bus.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
