Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos is perhaps the first great lyric poet still known to us today, \r\nand she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. \r\nShe is so revered for her erotic love poetry that we get our terms sapphic and \r\nlesbian from her name and island of residence. Sonnets are lyric \r\npoems and the lyr in lyric comes from the lyre, a harp-like instrument. \r\nSappho\'s poems were either sung or chanted to the strumming of a lyre. So she is \r\nnot only the godmother of modern sonneteers, but also of singer-songwriters like \r\nAdele, Bono, David Bowie, James Brown, Jackson Browne, Johnny Cash, Harry \r\nChapin, Leonard Cohen, Sam Cooke, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Dan \r\nFogelberg, John Fogerty, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Woody Guthrie, Buddy Holly, \r\nMichael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Carole King, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Freddie \r\nMercury, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Sade, Stevie Nicks, Roy \r\nOrbison, Dolly Parton, Prince, Lou Reed, Keith Richards, Pete Seeger, Paul \r\nSimon, Bruce Springsteen, Bernie Taupin, Tom Waits, Hank Williams Sr., Brian \r\nWilson, Stevie Wonder and Neil Young.\r\n\r\nThe sonnets on this page were written by poets as diverse as Conrad Aiken, \r\nWilliam Blake, Louise Bogan, Robert Burns, John Clare, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, \r\nHart Crane, e. e. cummings, Emily Dickinson, Ernest Dowson, Robert Frost, Robert \r\nHayden, Seamus Heaney, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Henry Howard the Earl of Surrey, \r\nJohn Keats, D. H. Lawrence, Emma Lazarus, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert \r\nMezey, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Milton, Richard Moore, Wilfred Owen, Sylvia \r\nPlath, William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Sir Philip Sidney, Wallace \r\nStevens, Sara Teasdale, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, Richard Wilbur, Oscar Wilde, \r\nWilliam Wordsworth, Sir Thomas Wyatt and W. B. Yeats. There are also \r\ntranslations of poems by Caedmon (the first English poet), William Dunbar (the \r\nfirst great Scottish poet), and Rainer Maria Rilke (who wrote poems in German \r\nand French).\r\n\r\nPicking the greatest sonnets of all time involves personal taste and fancy. (So \r\nif you disagree with my choices, \r\nplease feel free to compile your own!) Perhaps the most interesting thing about \r\nmy personal canon is that most of the sonnets are fairly recent. This \r\nleads me to believe that the death of poetry has been greatly exaggerated. \r\nAnother interesting thing is where Shakespeare ranks (or doesn\'t). For my \r\npurposes here, I will interpret the term sonnet according to its original \r\ndefinition;  the Italian word sonneto means \r\nlittle song. When the term sonnet was first used in English, it referred to \r\nany short poem about love and the words song and sonnet were \r\ninterchangeable. So I see no need for a slavish obedience to any particular \r\nform or rhyme scheme. None of my top ten sonnets are \r\nstandard Shakespearean or Petrarchan forms. In his article on the sonnet for\r\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, Anthony Hecht observed that all canonical \r\nforms inspire or require innovation. And there was certainly a lot of innovating by the \r\npoets who follow!

Roberts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first confessional poets, and certainly one \r\nthe best. She won a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\r\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \r\npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life. The confessional \r\npoets exposed their inner selves to the reading public through their verse. \r\nWhen we hear songwriters like Janis Ian, Alicia Keys, Madonna, Stevie Nicks, \r\nSade and Taylor Swift telling us their inmost secrets, they are following in the \r\nfootsteps of the confessional poets.\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\r\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\r\n\r\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\r\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\r\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\r\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\r\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\r\n\r\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\r\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\r\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\r\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\r\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \r\nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \r\nproper and violently homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \r\nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous for his \r\ndisdain for dull and dulling conformity, as his witty epigrams attest. But the \r\nlovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that he was also a true poet \r\ncapable of \r\ncreating timeless art. \r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his poems \r\nof unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne have \r\nleft her almost as famous. The first poem below is a loose translation of a \r\nRonsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his life in her later years, \r\ntending a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley was one of a number of great Romantic poets who died many, many years \r\nbefore their time. Others include John Keats, Lord Byron, Robert Burns, Wilfred \r\nOwen, Hart Crane, Sylvia Plath, and the marvelous boy who helped kickstart the \r\nRomantic movement, Thomas Chatteron. Shelley\'s touch with meter and rhyme was exquisite.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\nPercy and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most \r\nnotorious married couple of their era. He was a dashing romantic poet and \r\nheretic who wrote a tract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled \r\nfrom Oxford. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \r\nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \r\nGodwin. The spent the summer of 1816 with Lord \r\nByron. It was at this time that Mary conceived the story that became her famous \r\ngothic novel Frankenstein. Six years later, her husband drowned at sea \r\nat age thirty. Who knows what he would have accomplished if he had lived longer, \r\nbut he is still considered to be one of the greatest English poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was an English romantic poet, painter, illustrator \r\nand translator. He was also one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite \r\nBrotherhood. His art was characterized by sensuality and medieval revivalism. In \r\n1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal (pictured above), who became his model, his \r\npassion, and eventually in 1860, his wife.\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nI have been here before,\r\n\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\n\r\nThe sweet keen smell,\r\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore. \r\nYou have been mine before,\r\n\r\nHow long ago I may not know:\r\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\r\n\r\nYour neck turned so,\r\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore. \r\nHas this been thus before?\r\n\r\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\r\nStill with our lives our love restore\r\n\r\nIn death\'s despite,\r\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more? \r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti\'s sister Christina was also a poet, and perhaps the \r\nbetter of the two. \r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElinor Wylie was famous during her life almost as much for her ethereal beauty \r\nand personality as for her melodious, sensuous poetry.\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \r\npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \r\nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \r\nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \r\nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \r\nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, \r\nmasturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. \r\nThe Truth the Dead Know\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\r\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\r\n\r\nGone, I say and walk from church,\r\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\r\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\r\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\r\n\r\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\r\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\r\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\r\nand we touch. In another country people die.\r\n\r\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\r\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\r\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\r\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\r\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\r\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\r\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \r\nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \r\nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \r\nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \r\nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \r\nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \r\nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \r\ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) She was \r\nalso one of the best modern writer of sonnets, if not the best. \r\n\r\nDirge Without Music\r\nby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.\r\nSo it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:\r\nInto the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned\r\nWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.\r\nLovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.\r\nBe one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.\r\nA fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,\r\nA formula, a phrase remains,but the best is lost.\r\nThe answers quick  keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\r\nThey are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled\r\nIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.\r\nMore precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.\r\nDown, down, down into the darkness of the grave\r\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;\r\nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.\r\nI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\r\nI shall remember you with love, or season\r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this now-famous sonnet was written in 1883 it barely caused a ripple. When its author died in 1887, the poem wasn\'t even mentioned in her obituary. And yet today, \r\nmost Americans can probably recite a line or two, or at least recognize the most \r\nfamous lines when quoted. Emma Lazarus\'sThe New Colossusdid not create much of a stir until it was affixed inside the base of the Statue of Liberty in 1903. \r\nSince then the poem has changed the perceived meaning and purpose of the Statue of Liberty itself. As a gift from the government of France, purchased with coins donated \r\nby French school children, the Statue was meant to symbolize the hard-won \r\nliberty of two nations that had become friends. Today, thanks to Lazarus\'s sonnet, \r\nLady Liberty is better known as a beacon to immigrants and a welcoming to America. \r\nAccording to John T. Cunningham, The Statue of Liberty was not conceived and \r\nsculpted as a symbol of immigration, but it quickly became so as immigrant ships \r\npassed under the statue. However, it was Lazarus\'s poem that permanently stamped \r\non Miss Liberty the role of unofficial greeter of incoming immigrants. Paul Auster \r\nagreed, saying, Bartholdi\'s gigantic effigy was originally intended as a \r\nmonument to the principles of international republicanism, but \'The New \r\nColossus\' reinvented the statue\'s purpose, turning Liberty into a welcoming \r\nmother, a symbol of hope to the outcasts and downtrodden of the world. \r\n\r\nThe\r\nNew Colossus\r\nby Emma Lazarus\r\n\r\nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\r\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\r\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\r\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\r\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\r\nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\r\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\r\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\r\nKeep, ancient lands, your storied pomp! cries she\r\nWith silent lips. Give me your tired, your poor,\r\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\r\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\r\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\r\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArchaic Torso of Apollo\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe cannot know the beheaded god\r\nnor his eyes\' forfeited visions. But still\r\nthe figure\'s trunk glows with the strange vitality\r\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\r\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\r\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\r\nnor the centering loins make us smile\r\nat the thought of their generative animus.\r\nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\r\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\r\nprojecting procreation\'s triangular spearhead upwards,\r\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\r\nlike an inchoate stardemanding our belief.\r\nYou must change your life.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR\'S NOTE: I believe this is a poem about a major resolution: changing the very \r\nnature of one\'s life. While it is only my personal \r\ninterpretation of the poem, I think Rilke was saying to himself: I \r\nmust change my life. Why? Perhaps because he wanted to be a real artist, and \r\nwhen confronted with real, dynamic, living-and-breathing art of the sculptor \r\nRodin, he realized that \r\nhe had to inject the same vital and muscular elements into his poetry. Michelangelo said that he \r\nsaw the angel in a block of marble, then freed it. Perhaps Rilke had to \r\nfind the dynamic image of Apollo, the God of Poetry, in his materials, which \r\nwere paper, ink and his imagination.Michael R. Burch \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRondel\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\nOur time has passed.\n\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\nLike all good things we know can never last,\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting poem, not only because it\'s sad and lovely, but because \r\nthe poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne! And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to English \r\npoetry, adapting it from the French rondeau. You can learn more about \r\nKevin Roberts and read more of his poems by clicking his hyperlinked name. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nRobert Hayden is probably an unknown or undervalued poet to most readers today, \r\nbut every reader should be intimately familiar with this wonderful poem. Those \r\nWinter Sundays illustrates, I believe, how one stellar poem can make a poet immortal. I may never \r\nremember another poem by Hayden, but I will certainly never forget this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep is a consoling elegy with a \r\nmysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye (1905-2004), a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written \r\npoetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not being one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed \r\nfor some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nHere is a printable version of\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye\'s Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep which is not \r\ncopyrighted and is thus in the public domain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost was well-acquainted with darkness, because members of his family \r\nwrestled with depression and insanity. My interpretation of the poem is that \r\nnight symbolizes the speaker\'s depression, loneliness and feelings of \r\nalienation. And while in poetry light often symbolizes the brighter aspects of \r\nlife, here the appearance of light is neutral, not helpful. While the poem is \r\nwritten in iambic pentameter and has fourteen lines like a traditional sonnet, \r\nit employs a terza rima rhyme scheme with the pattern aba bcb cdc \r\ndad aa. There is even an element of the villanelle, a refrain, as the first \r\nline is repeated at the end of the poem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet nowhere, one leaf or flower of rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is one of my favorite \r\npoems from the early days of English poetry. I chose to translate it myself, to make \r\nit more accessible to modern readers. While Robert Burns is generally considered \r\nto be the greatest Scottish poet, and for very good reasons, his ancient peer \r\nWilliam Dunbar should definitely remain in the discussion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen, in my opinion, is a war poet without peer and one of the first great modern \r\npoets. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est may be the best graphic anti-war poem in the \r\nEnglish language, and perhaps in any language. If man ever grows wise enough to abolish war, Wilfred Owen\'s voice, echoed in thousands of other poems \r\nand songs through the years, will surely have been a major catalyst. Other poets \r\ndescribed the glory of war, but Owen conveyed war\'s horrendously gory nature. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep \r\nmonotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard \r\ndaylight steer.\r\n\r\nI can\'t remember where I first read The Death of a Toad by Richard Wilbur, but \r\nthe poem haunted me until I finally rediscovered it many years later, flipping through \r\nthe pages of a poetry anthology in a bookstore. I had forgotten the poem\'s title and \r\nits poet\'s name, but I had never been able to forget its words\' magic. So I am \r\nplacing it high on this page, wanting to be sure other readers are able to enjoy what I \r\nmissed for so many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Musicby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nConrad Aiken, in his best poems, rivals T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \r\nmasters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s lovely and intensely touching Bread and Music is one of my \r\nvery favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nI - Easter Hymn\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\nA. E. Housman, to my knowledge, never wrote a conventional sonnet. But this poem \r\nfits my definition of a sonnet as a little song of around\r\nfourteen lines. Housman was an atheist, but this poem seems better than \r\ncertain versions of Christianity to me, as Housman doesn\'t ask that only people \r\nwho agree with his faith be saved. I interpret it as a plea for everyone to be \r\nsaved, if anyone is listening above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutumn Day\r\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLord, it is time! Let the immense summer go!\r\nLay your long shadows over the sundials\r\nand over the meadows, let the free winds blow.\r\nCommand the late fruits to fatten and shine;\r\nO, grant them another Mediterranean hour!\r\nUrge them to completion, and with power\r\nconvey final sweetness to the sagging vine.\r\nWho has no house now, never will build one.\r\nWho\'s alone now, shall continue alone;\r\nhe\'ll wake, read, write long letters to friends,\r\nand pace the tree-lined pathways up and down,\r\nrestlessly, as autumn leaves drift and descend.\r\n\r\nThis is my modern English translation of one of Rilke\'s less familiar poems. I \r\nhope I did it justice. In the process of translating the poem, I consulted \r\ntranslations by Robert Bly, Guntram Deichsel, M. D. Herter Norton, Steven Gerard \r\nWagner and others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Is Too Much With Usby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\r\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\r\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\r\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\r\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\r\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\r\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\r\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\r\nIt moves us not.Great God! I\'d rather be\r\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\r\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\r\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\r\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\r\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreath\xe8d horn.\r\n\r\n\r\nComposed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802by\r\nWilliam Wordsworth\r\n\r\nEarth has not anything to show more fair:\r\nDull would he be of soul who could pass by\r\nA sight so touching in its majesty:\r\nThis City now doth, like a garment, wear\r\nThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\r\nShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\r\nOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;\r\nAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.\r\nNever did sun more beautifully steep\r\nIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;\r\nNe\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\r\nThe river glideth at his own sweet will:\r\nDear God! the very houses seem asleep;\r\nAnd all that mighty heart is lying still!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free\r\nby William\r\nWordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a beauteous evening, calm and free,\r\nThe holy time is quiet as a Nun\r\nBreathless with adoration; the broad sun\r\nIs sinking down in its tranquillity;\r\nThe gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the Sea:\r\nListen! the mighty Being is awake,\r\nAnd doth with his eternal motion make\r\nA sound like thundereverlastingly.\r\nDear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,\r\nIf thou appear untouched by solemn thought,\r\nThy nature is not therefore less divine:\r\nThou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year;\r\nAnd worship\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine,\r\nGod being with thee when we know it not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Without Hope\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nLines Composed 21st February 1825\r\n\r\nAll Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair\r\nThe bees are stirringbirds are on the wing\r\nAnd Winter slumbering in the open air,\r\nWears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!\r\nAnd I the while, the sole unbusy thing,\r\nNor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.\r\n\r\nYet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,\r\nHave traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.\r\nBloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,\r\nFor me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!\r\nWith lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:\r\nAnd would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?\r\nWork without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,\r\nAnd Hope without an object cannot live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda and the Swan\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\r\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\r\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\r\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\r\n\r\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\r\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\r\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\r\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\r\n\r\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\r\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\r\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\r\n \r\nBeing so caught up,\r\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\r\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\r\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats was probably the last of the great Romantics and the first of the \r\ngreat Modernists. He wrote a good number of truly great poems, and remains an \r\nessential poet of the highest rank. Other poems of his that I especially love \r\ninclude An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, The Wild Swans at Coole and \r\nLeda and the Swan. \r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not Allby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof \r\nagainst the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and \r\nsink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath\r\nNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making \r\nfriends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be \r\nthat in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor \r\nnagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love \r\nfor peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I \r\ndo not think I would.\r\n\r\nIf I should learn, in some quite casual way\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nIf I should learn, in some quite casual way,\r\nThat you were gone, not to \r\nreturn again\r\nRead from the back-page of a paper, say,\r\nHeld by a neighbor in a \r\nsubway train,\r\nHow at the corner of this avenue\r\nAnd such a street (so \r\nare the papers filled)\r\nA hurrying manwho happened to be you\r\nAt noon to-day \r\nhad happened to be killed,\r\nI should not cry aloudI could not cry\r\nAloud, or \r\nwring my hands in such a place\r\nI should but watch the station lights \r\nrush by\r\nWith a more careful interest on my face,\r\nOr raise my eyes and read \r\nwith greater care\r\nWhere to store furs and how to treat the hair.\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\n\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\nOr rich with red corundum or with blue,\r\nLocked, and the key withheld, as other girls\r\nHave given their loves, I give my love to you;\r\nNot in a lovers\'-knot, not in a ring\r\nWorked in such fashion, and the legend plain\r\nSemper fidelis, where a secret spring\r\nKennels a drop of mischief for the brain:\r\nLove in the open hand, no thing but that,\r\nUngemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,\r\nAs one should bring you cowslips in a hat\r\nSwung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,\r\nI bring you, calling out as children do:\r\nLook what I have!And these are all for you.\r\n\r\nMillay is not just another penner of sonnets. Her sonnets sparkle with life, \r\nlust and wit amid the foreshadowing of death. She also has an interesting quality of \r\nresolve: she seems willing to give herself to men, but not to give herself away. \r\nIf she is playing games, she is playing them knowingly, and probably understands \r\nthe rules better than her partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistant light\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\n\r\nHarsh and cold\r\nautumn holds to it our naked trees:\r\nIf only you would free, at least, the sparrows\r\nfrom the tips of your fingers\r\nand release a smile, a small smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned cry I see.\r\nSing! Can we sing\r\nas if we were light, hand in hand\r\nsheltered in shade, under a strong sun?\r\nWill you remain, this way\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than necessary, and \r\nquiet?\r\nDarkness intensifies\r\nand the distant light is our only consolation\r\nthat one, which from the beginning\r\nhas, little by little, been flickering\r\nand is now about to go out.\r\nCome to me. Closer and closer.\r\nI dont want to know my hand from yours.\r\nAnd lets beware of sleep, lest the snow smother us.\r\n\r\nTranslated by Khaled Mattawa from the author\'s collections Ghuruf Taisha (Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1992) and Satwat al-Masa \r\n(Dar Bissan, Beirut, 1996).

He is considered one of the best Palestinian poets; his poetry has been said to be \r\ncharacterized by metaphoric originality and a novel thematic approach unprecedented in Arabic poetry. He was awarded the first \r\nPalestine Prize for Poetry in 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels than for his poetry, but Piano \r\nis an immortal poem, and thus makes Lawrence an immortal poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson\'s influence on T. S. Eliot is obvious, and anyone who reads his best poems can easily understand the attraction. Other writers unabashedly borrowed phrases from Dowson: \r\ngone with the wind, the days of wine and roses, hollow lands, etc. The best poets write memorable lines, and Dowson\'s best poems are full of memorable lines. \r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the Masters page of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nFinal Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nLight the first light of evening, as in a room\r\nIn which we rest and, for small reason, think\r\nThe world imagined is the ultimate good.\r\n\r\nThis is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. \r\nIt is in that thought that we collect ourselves,\r\nOut of all the indifferences, into one thing:\r\n\r\nWithin a single thing, a single shawl\r\nWrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, \r\nA light, a power, the miraculous influence.\r\n\r\nHere, now, we forget each other and ourselves.\r\nWe feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, \r\nA knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nWithin its vital boundary, in the mind.\r\nWe say God and the imagination are one ... \r\nHow high that highest candle lights the dark.\r\n\r\nOut of this same light, out of the central mind, \r\nWe make a dwelling in the evening air, \r\nIn which being there together is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nTea at the Palaz of Hoon\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nNot less because in purple I descended\r\nThe western day through what you called\r\nThe loneliest air, not less was I myself.\r\n\r\nWhat was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?\r\nWhat were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?\r\nWhat was the sea whose tide swept through me there?\r\n\r\nOut of my mind the golden ointment rained,\r\nAnd my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.\r\nI was myself the compass of that sea:\r\n\r\nI was the world in which I walked, and what I saw\r\nOr heard or felt came not but from myself;\r\nAnd there I found myself more truly and more strange.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens is one of the very best modern poets, if not the best. My \r\nfavorites among his poems include Sunday Morning, The Snow Man, The Man \r\nWhose Pharynx Was Bad and Tea at the Palaz of Hoon. Several of his poems can be found on \r\nthe \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nIf I understand Stevens correctlyand \r\nit\'s quite possible that I don\'the spent a lot of time considering what one \r\nmight call the meaning of life. He apparently didn\'t believe in the gods of \r\nhuman religion. He did however seem to embrace, to some degree, the idea of \r\nRomantics like William Blake that divinity lies in the human, and particularly \r\nin the human imagination. Stevens called poets priests of the invisible and \r\ninvisible things are products of the imagination. We can create castles in our \r\nminds (and even lovers to inhabit them!). When Stevens says How high the highest \r\ncandle lights the dark, he may be thinking of the great poetic and artistic \r\nworks of the imagination. And we who are lucky enough to read his superb poem \r\nmay be glimpsing the light of that high, illuminating candle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMouse\'s Nest\r\n\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\r\nAnd progged it as I passed and went away;\r\nAnd when I looked I fancied something stirred,\r\nAnd turned again and hoped to catch the bird \r\nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheats\r\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats;\r\nShe looked so odd and so grotesque to me,\r\nI ran and wondered what the thing could be,\r\nAnd pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood;\r\nThen the mouse hurried from the craking brood.\r\nThe young ones squeaked, and as I went away\r\nShe found her nest again among the hay.\r\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\r\nAnd broad old cesspools glittered in the sun.\r\n\r\nJohn Clare, while perhaps not a Romantic poet in the style of Shelley and Keats, \r\nwas a Romantic inasmuch as he could get down and dirty with the best of them. \r\nHe may be the direct ancestor of poets like Robinson Jeffers, who wrote \r\ntruthfully about nature and seemed to scorn sheen in poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the \r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman is one of the most important poets of all time, not only because \r\nhis best poems are masterpieces, but because of his influence on other poets, \r\nand on the American psyche. A Noiseless Patient Spider is a wonderfully \r\nmystical poem by America\'s Merlin. You can find a number of his poems on the\r\nMasters page of\r\nThe HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nIn poems like Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night, In My Craft or Sullen \r\nArt and Fern Hill the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas ranks with any poet who ever \r\nwrote in English. \r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nEzra Pound is not one of my favorite poets, but this poem is a wonderful \r\nminiature of English society, captured in a poem for the ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI - Easter Hymn\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousman could \r\nwrite movingly without indulging in images, melodrama or sophistry, and rivals \r\nShakespeare in what he could accomplish with direct statement. Housman is \r\ncertainly a major poet, and one of our very best critics of society and \r\nreligion, along with Blake, Twain and Wilde. A good number of his poems can be \r\nfound on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\nIn Time of The Breaking of Nations\r\nby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nOnly a man harrowing clods\r\nIn a slow silent walk,\r\nWith an old horse that stumbles and nods\r\nHalf asleep as they stalk.\r\n\r\nOnly thin smoke without flame\r\nFrom the heaps of couch grass:\r\nYet this will go onward the same\r\nThough Dynasties pass.\r\n\r\nYonder a maid and her wight\r\nCome whispering by;\r\nWar\'s annals will fade into night\r\nEre their story die.\r\n\r\nThomas Hardy wrote a number of truly great poems, including The Darkling \r\nThrush, The Convergence of the Twain and Channel Firing.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\nJohn Donne wrote some of the sexiest poems in the English language, and some of \r\nthe best devotional poems as well. Talk about range!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn (circa 658-680 AD)\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the \r\neternal Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the first Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\r\nGuardian of mankind. Then he, the eternal Lord,\r\nafterwards made men middle-earth: Master almighty!\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the \r\nVenerable Bede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who was given the \r\ngift of poetic composition by an angel. In the original poem, hardly a word is \r\nrecognizable as English. C\xe6dmon was writing in a somewhat Anglicized form of \r\nancient German. The word England harkens back to Angle-land; the Angles were a \r\nGermanic tribe. Nevertheless, by C\xe6dmon\'s time the foundations of English poetry \r\nwere being laid, particularly in the areas of accentual meter and alliteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes Mysteriously\r\n\r\nby Luis Omar Salinas\r\n\r\nSometimes in the evening when love\r\ntunes its harp and the crickets\r\ncelebrate life, I am like a troubadour\r\nin search of friends, loved ones,\r\nanyone who will share with me\r\na bit of conversation. My loneliness\r\narrives ghostlike and pretentious,\r\nit seeks my soul, it is ravenous\r\nand hurting. I admire my father\r\nwho always has advice in these matters,\r\nbut a game of chess won\'t do, or\r\nthe frivolity of religion.\r\nI want to find a solution, so I\r\nwrite letters, poems, and sometimes\r\nI touch solitude on the shoulder\r\nand surrender to a great tranquility.\r\nI understand I need courage\r\nand sometimes, mysteriously,\r\nI feel whole.\r\n\r\nLuis Omar Salinas is generally considered to be one of the very best Hispanic \r\npoets to write in English, and with good cause. Sometimes Mysteriously is one of \r\nthose mysterious poems that sometimes makes us feel a special kinship with the \r\npoet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nG. M. Hopkins did things with the language no poet before or since has done, or \r\nat least not as well and to the same extent. His influence can be seen in the \r\nwork of Dylan Thomas, but no one has ever duplicated his rhythms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\r\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\r\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\r\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\r\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\r\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\r\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\r\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\r\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\r\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\r\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\r\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\r\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\r\n\r\nit may not always be so; and i say\r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nit may not always be so;and i say\r\nthat if your lips,which i have loved,should touch\r\nanother\'s,and your dear strong fingers clutch\r\nhis heart,as mine in time not far away;\r\nif on another\'s face your sweet hair lay\r\nin such a silence as i know,or such\r\ngreat writhing words as,uttering overmuch,\r\nstand helplessly before the spirit at bay;\r\n\r\nif this should be,i say if this should be\r\nyou of my heart,send me a little word;\r\nthat i may go unto him,and take his hands,\r\nsaying,Accept all happiness from me.\r\nThen shall i turn my face,and hear one bird\r\nsing terribly afar in the lost lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nin Just-by e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nin Just-\r\nspring when the world is mud-\r\nluscious the little\r\nlame baloonman\r\n\r\nwhistles far and wee\r\n\r\nand eddieandbill come\r\nrunning from marbles and\r\npiracies and it\'s\r\nspring\r\n\r\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\r\n\r\nthe queer\r\nold baloonman whistles\r\nfar and wee\r\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\r\n\r\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\r\nit\'s\r\nspring\r\nand\r\n\r\n the\r\ngoat-footed\r\n\r\nbaloonMan whistles\r\nfar\r\nand\r\nwee\r\n\r\nE. E. Cummings (or e. e. cummings) has long been one of my favorite poets. I \r\nlove his musicality, his whimsy, and his defiance of convention. In his darker \r\npoems like I sing of Olaf, glad and big, I love his fierce wrath against \r\ninjustice. In my opinion he is one of the major poets of the modern era.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the Masters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nTom Moore was an Irish tenor, songwriter and poet; this wonderfully haunting poem \r\ndemonstrates his virtuosity as a poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was one of the early romantics (perhaps a forerunner of both \r\nShelley and Clare), and one of my early favorites along with Blake and Housman. \r\nHe still reads well today, I think.

There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nJuan\'s Song\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nWhen beauty breaks and falls asunder\r\nI feel no grief for it, but wonder.\r\nWhen love, like a frail shell, lies broken,\r\nI keep no chip of it for token.\r\nI never had a man for friend\r\nWho did not know that love must end.\r\nI never had a girl for lover\r\nWho could discern when love was over.\r\nWhat the wise doubt, the fool believes\r\nWho is it, then, that love deceives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning, from Sonnets from the \r\nPortuguese\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting at Night\r\nby Robert Browning\r\n\r\nThe grey sea and the long black land;\r\nAnd the yellow half-moon large and low;\r\nAnd the startled little waves that leap\r\nIn fiery ringlets from their sleep,\r\nAs I gain the cove with pushing prow,\r\nAnd quench its speed i\' the slushy sand.\r\n\r\nThen a mile of warm sea-scented beach;\r\nThree fields to cross till a farm appears;\r\nA tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch\r\nAnd blue spurt of a lighted match,\r\nAnd a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,\r\nThan the two hearts beating each to each!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats, after a poem by Pierre \r\nRonsard \r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\r\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\r\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\r\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\r\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\r\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\r\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\r\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\r\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\r\nNever have relish in the faery power\r\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\r\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\r\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were stedfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient, sleepless Eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors\r\nNoyet still stedfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live everor else swoon to death.\r\n\r\nHow many bards gild the lapses of time!\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many bards gild the lapses of time!\r\nA few of them have ever been the food\r\nOf my delighted fancy,I could brood\r\nOver their beauties, earthly, or sublime:\r\nAnd often, when I sit me down to rhyme,\r\nThese will in throngs before my mind intrude:\r\nBut no confusion, no disturbance rude\r\nDo they occasion; tis a pleasing chime.\r\nSo the unnumberd sounds that evening store;\r\nThe songs of birdsthe whispring of the leaves\r\nThe voice of watersthe great bell that heaves\r\nWith solemn sound,and thousand others more\r\nThat distance of recognizance bereaves,\r\nMake pleasing music, and not wild uproar.\r\n\r\nExperts continue to disagree as to \r\nwhether Keats wrote Bright Star for Fanny Brawne, or not. But she seems to be \r\nthe most likely candidate. In the poem Keats seems to waver between longing for \r\nimmortality and death. He died three years after writing the poem, at age 25, \r\nafter a long struggle with tuberculosis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nTichborne\'s elegy to himself remains one of the best and most powerful in the \r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\nWylie\'s poem reminds me of Clare, and of D. H. Lawrence\'s snake, and also of \r\nRichard Wilbur\'s tour-de-force, The Death of a Toad. And yet her poem is \r\nwholly unique and original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCargoes\r\nby John Masefield \r\n\r\n\r\nQuinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir,\r\nRowing home to haven in sunny Palestine,\r\nWith a cargo of ivory,\r\nAnd apes and peacocks,\r\nSandalwood, cedarwood, and sweet white wine.\r\n\r\nStately Spanish galleon coming from the Isthmus, \r\n\r\nDipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of diamonds,\r\nEmeralds, amethysts,\r\nTopazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores.\r\n\r\nDirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack, \r\n\r\nButting through the Channel in the mad March days, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of Tyne coal,\r\nRoad-rails, pig-lead,\r\nFirewood, iron-ware, and cheap tin trays.\r\n\r\nJohn Masefield contrasts three freighters from three very different empires \r\nand times, and manages to tell us much about each entirely through contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bishop wrote a small handful of truly great poems such as One Art, \r\nThe Fish and The Armadillo, and can probably be considered a major poet as a \r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope Is A Thing With Feathersby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nHope is a thing with feathers\r\nThat perches in the soul\r\nAnd sings a tune without words\r\nAnd never stops at all.\r\n\r\nAnd sweetest, in the gale, is heard\r\nAnd sore must be the storm\r\nThat could abash the little bird\r\nThat keeps so many warm.\r\n\r\nIve heard it in the chilliest land\r\nAnd on the strangest sea\r\nYet, never, in extremity\r\nIt ask a crumb of me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA light exists in spring\r\n\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\n\r\nA light exists in Spring\r\nNot present on the year\r\nAt any other period\r\nWhen March is scarcely here\r\n\r\nA color stands abroad\r\nOn solitary fields\r\nThat science cannot overtake\r\nBut human nature feels.\r\n\r\nIt waits upon the lawn,\r\nIt shows the furthest tree\r\nUpon the furthest slope we know;\r\nIt almost speaks to me.\r\n\r\nThen, as horizons step,\r\nOr noons report away,\r\nWithout the formula of sound,\r\nIt passes, and we stay:\r\n\r\nA quality of loss\r\nAffecting our content,\r\nAs trade had suddenly encroached\r\nUpon a sacrament.\r\n\r\nI Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nI heard a fly buzz when I died;\r\nThe stillness round my form\r\nWas like the stillness in the air\r\nBetween the heaves of storm.\r\n\r\nThe eyes beside had wrung them dry,\r\nAnd breaths were gathering sure\r\nFor that last onset, when the King\r\nBe witnessed in his power.\r\n\r\nI willed my keepsakes, signed away\r\nWhat portion of me I\r\nCould make assignable  and then\r\nThere interposed a fly,\r\n\r\nWith blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz\r\nBetween the light and me;\r\nAnd then the windows failed  and then\r\nI could not see to see.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson and Walt Whitman were the first great original American poets, \r\nbut they were as different as night and day! Not only did they never meet, but \r\nDickinson declined to even read Whitman\'s poems because he was considered to be \r\nscandalous. Meanwhile, he probably didn\'t know who she was, because very few of \r\nher poems were published until after her death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides . . . High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\n\r\nVoyages, Part I\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nAbove the fresh ruffles of the surf\r\nBright striped urchins flay each other with sand. \r\n\r\nThey have contrived a conquest for shell shucks, \r\n\r\nAnd their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed \r\n\r\nGaily digging and scattering.\r\n\r\nAnd in answer to their treble interjections \r\n\r\nThe sun beats lightning on the waves,\r\nThe waves fold thunder on the sand;\r\nAnd could they hear me I would tell them: \r\n\r\n\r\nO brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,\r\nFondle your shells and sticks, bleached\r\nBy time and the elements; but there is a line \r\n\r\nYou must not cross nor ever trust beyond it \r\n\r\nSpry cordage of your bodies to caresses\r\nToo lichen-faithful from too wide a breast. \r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea is cruel.\r\n\r\nTo Emily Dickinson\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nYou who desired so muchin vain to ask\r\nYet fed your hunger like an endless task,\r\nDared dignify the labor, bless the quest\r\nAchieved that stillness ultimately best,\r\n\r\nBeing, of all, least sought for: Emily, hear!\r\nO sweet, dead Silencer, most suddenly clear\r\nWhen singing that Eternity possessed\r\nAnd plundered momently in every breast;\r\n\r\nTruly no flower yet withers in your hand,\r\nThe harvest you descried and understand\r\nNeeds more than wit to gather, love to bind.\r\nSome reconcilement of remotest mind\r\n\r\nLeaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.\r\nElse tears heap all within one clay-cold hill.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the long version of Hart Crane\'s Voyages is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. Since this is a page of sonnets I have \r\nlimited myself to the opening lines only. Other poems of Crane\'s such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower \r\nalso rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language. The last line above seems prophetic, as \r\nCrane jumped from a ship to his death in Gulf of Mexico. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime in Eternity\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nWhen you were as an angel in my arms,\r\nHad laid your bare head just below my chin,\r\nYour length pressed up to mine, entrusting charms\r\nMy whole youth\'s starward longing could not win;\r\nWith still the murmur of your love in me,\r\nMiracle-tones of all my lifelong hope,\r\nI wished that there might start eternity\r\nAnd seal forever that sweet envelope;\r\nAnd as it did, my thoughts are now for you\r\nAs every star is blotted by the sun,\r\nAnd so the sun itself\r\nHas perished too,\r\nAnd with it, every dream of mine\r\nBut one.\r\n\r\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCicada Cadence\r\nby\r\nHenry \r\nGeorge Fischer\r\n\r\nAgain the sounds of summer resonate\r\nAs chitinous cicadas, locusts, crickets\r\nSome stridently, some softly, stridulate\r\nIn hills and valleys, meadows, woods and thickets.\r\n\r\nThey\'re here, those ambient gambists, each astride\r\nA twig or leaf or swaying blade of grass,\r\nAnd mesmerize our dozing ears, misguide\r\nUs into thinking none of this will pass\r\n\r\nA notion the nocturnal croaking caucus\r\nOf katydids denies, whose farthest cry\r\nBy day\'s outdone in August by the raucous\r\nBuzzing of the dogday harvest fly,\r\n\r\nRipsawing inspissated heat, portending,\r\nIn its crescendo, an inevitable ending.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being an accomplished poet, Henry George Fischer \r\n[1923-2006] was the Metropolitan Museum of Art curator emeritus of Egyptology who helped the Temple of Dendur find a new life in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ghost Ship\r\nby \r\nA. E. Stallings\r\n\r\nShe plies an inland sea. Dull\r\nWith rust, scarred by a jagged reef.\r\nIn Cyrillic, on her hull\r\nIs lettered, Grief.\r\n\r\nThe dim stars do not signify;\r\nNo sonar with its eerie ping\r\nSounds the depthsshe travels by\r\nDead reckoning.\r\n\r\nAt her heart is a stopped clock.\r\nIn her wake, the hours drag.\r\nThere is no port where she can dock,\r\nShe flies no flag,\r\n\r\nHas no allegiance to a state,\r\nNo registry, no harbor berth,\r\nNowhere to discharge her freight\r\nUpon the earth.\r\n\r\nA. E. Stallings is a contemporary poet who\'s making a name for herself, and \r\nleaving her mark on the world in the form of memorable poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nHerrick is pleasing to the ear, and should continue to be read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose\r\nby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nThis a near-perfect poem that still reads wonderfully well today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarter \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nAll beautiful and splendid things,\r\nBlue waves whitened on a cliff,\r\nSoaring fire that sways and sings,\r\nAnd children\'s faces looking up\r\nHolding wonder in a cup.\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nMusic like a curve of gold,\r\nScent of pine trees in the rain,\r\nEyes that love you, arms that hold,\r\nAnd for your spirit\'s still delight,\r\nHoly thoughts that star the night.\r\n\r\nSpend all you have for loveliness,\r\nBuy it and never count the cost;\r\nFor one white singing hour of peace\r\nCount many a year of strife well lost,\r\nAnd for a breath of ecstasy\r\nGive all you have been, or could be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solitaryby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nMy heart has grown rich with the passing of years,\r\n I have less need now than when I was young\r\nTo share myself with every comer\r\n Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.\r\nIt is one to me that they come or go\r\n If I have myself and the drive of my will,\r\nAnd strength to climb on a summer night\r\n And watch the stars swarm over the hill.\r\nLet them think I love them more than I do,\r\n Let them think I care, though I go alone;\r\nIf it lifts their pride, what is it to me\r\n Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.\r\n\r\nPeace\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nPeace flows into me\r\nAs the tide to the pool by the shore;\r\nIt is mine forevermore,\r\nIt ebbs not back like the sea.\r\n\r\nI am the pool of blue\r\nThat worships the vivid sky;\r\nMy hopes were heaven-high,\r\nThey are all fulfilled in you.\r\n\r\nI am the pool of gold\r\nWhen sunset burns and dies,\r\nYou are my deepening skies,\r\nGive me your stars to hold.\r\n\r\nSara Teasdale was one of Robert Frost\'s favorite contemporary poets, and he was \r\na hard man to please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\nEdgar Alan Poe strikes me generally as more of a storyteller (and a damn good \r\none) than a sonneteer, but I like this mystical chant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSea Fevers\r\nby Agnes Wathall\r\n\r\nNo ancient mariner I,\r\n Hawker of public crosses,\r\nSnaring the passersby\r\n With my necklace of albatrosses.\r\n\r\nI blink no glittering eye\r\n Between tufts of gray sea mosses\r\nNor in the high road ply\r\n My trade of guilts and glosses.\r\n\r\nBut a dark and inward sky\r\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\r\nNo more becalmed to lie,\r\n The skeleton ship tosses.\r\n\r\nAgnes Wathall is an unknown poet today, but this poem deserves to be read, and remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 147\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\r\nFor I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\nWho art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\r\n\r\nSonnet 97: How Like a Winter\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nHow like a winter hath my absence been\r\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\r\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\r\nWhat old December\'s bareness everywhere!\r\nAnd yet this time remov\'d was summer\'s time,\r\nThe teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\r\nBearing the wanton burthen of the prime,\r\nLike widow\'d wombs after their lords\' decease:\r\nYet this abundant issue seem\'d to me\r\nBut hope of orphans and unfather\'d fruit;\r\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\r\nAnd thou away, the very birds are mute;\r\n Or if they sing, \'tis with so dull a cheer\r\n That leaves look pale, dreading the winter\'s near.\r\n\r\nI\'m not a huge fan of Shakespeare\'s sonnets, which are often on the theme of \r\nlove but strike me as more philosophical than emotionally moving, as if the Bard \r\nof Avon didn\'t have his heart invested in some of them. I wonder if Shakespeare \r\nwas commissioned to write the sonnets, or felt obliged to write them for a \r\npatron. But in any case, the two sonnets above are far too good to leave out, \r\nand if one likes philosophical love poems Shakespeare was one of the best, \r\nalthough perhaps second to John Donne (who seems more invested in his love \r\npoems to me). I do love a number of Shakespeare\'s songs, such as Full fathom \r\nfive, Blow, blow thou winter wind, Fear no more the heat o\' the sun, Under \r\nthe greenwood tree and When that I was a little tiny boy. In addition to \r\nbeing the greatest of playwrights, Shakespeare may have been the first superstar \r\nsongwriter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nThe little song above is short enough to qualify as a sonnet (little song), so \r\nI\'m glad to include it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cross of Snow\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nIn the long, sleepless watches of the night,\r\nA gentle facethe face of one long dead\r\nLooks at me from the wall, where round its head\r\nThe night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.\r\nHere in this room she died; and soul more white\r\nNever through martyrdom of fire was led\r\nTo its repose; nor can in books be read\r\nThe legend of a life more benedight.\r\nThere is a mountain in the distant West\r\nThat, sun-defying, in its deep ravines\r\nDisplays a cross of snow upon its side.\r\nSuch is the cross I wear upon my breast\r\nThese eighteen years, through all the changing scenes\r\nAnd seasons, changeless since the day she died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAftermath\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the summer fields are mown,\r\nWhen the birds are fledged and flown,\r\nAnd the dry leaves strew the path;\r\nWith the falling of the snow,\r\nWith the cawing of the crow,\r\nOnce again the fields we mow\r\nAnd gather in the aftermath.\r\n\r\nNot the sweet, new grass with flowers\r\nIs this harvesting of ours;\r\nNot the upland clover bloom;\r\nBut the rowen mixed with weeds,\r\nTangled tufts from marsh and meads,\r\nWhere the poppy drops its seeds\r\nIn the silence and the gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucifer in Starlight\r\nby George Meredith\r\n\r\nOn a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose.\r\nTired of his dark dominion, swung the fiend\r\nAbove the rolling ball, in cloud part screened,\r\nWhere sinners hugged their specter of repose.\r\nPoor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.\r\nAnd now upon his western wing he leaned,\r\nNow his huge bulk o\'er Afric\'s sands careened,\r\nNow the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.\r\nSoaring through wider zones that pricked his scars\r\nWith memory of the old revolt from Awe,\r\nHe reached a middle height, and at the stars,\r\nWhich are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.\r\nAround the ancient track marched, rank on rank,\r\nThe army of unalterable law.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Patrick Kanouse for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Second Troy\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhy should I blame her that she filled my days\r\nWith misery, or that she would of late\r\nHave taught to ignorant men most violent ways,\r\nOr hurled the little streets upon the great,\r\nHad they but courage equal to desire?\r\nWhat could have made her peaceful with a mind\r\nThat nobleness made simple as a fire,\r\nWith beauty like a tightened bow, a kind\r\nThat is not natural in an age like this,\r\nBeing high and solitary and most stern?\r\nWhy, what could she have done, being what she is?\r\nWas there another Troy for her to burn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland in 1819\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nAn old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king,\r\nPrinces, the dregs of their dull race, who flow\r\nThrough public scorn,mud from a muddy spring,\r\nRulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,\r\nBut leech-like to their fainting country cling,\r\nTill they drop, blind in blood, without a blow,\r\nA people starved and stabbed in the untilled field,\r\nAn army, which liberticide and prey\r\nMakes as a two-edged sword to all who wield\r\nGolden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;\r\nReligion Christless, Godlessa book sealed;\r\nA Senate,Time\'s worst statute unrepealed,\r\nAre graves, from which a glorious Phantom may\r\nBurst, to illumine our tempestous day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian Serenade\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI arise from dreams of \r\nthee\r\nIn the first sweet sleep of night,\r\nWhen the winds are breathing low,\r\nAnd the stars are shining bright.\r\nI arise from dreams of thee,\r\nAnd a spirit in my feet\r\nHath led mewho knows how?\r\nTo thy chamber window, Sweet!\r\nThe wandering airs they faint\r\nOn the dark, the silent stream\r\nAnd the champak\'s odours pine\r\nLike sweet thoughts in a dream;\r\nThe nightingale\'s complaint,\r\nIt dies upon her heart,\r\nAs I must on thine,\r\nO belov\xe8d as thou art!\r\nO lift me from the grass!\r\nI die! I faint! I fail!\r\nLet thy love in kisses rain\r\nOn my lips and eyelids pale.\r\nMy cheek is cold and white, alas!\r\nMy heart beats loud and fast:\r\nO press it to thine own again,\r\nWhere it will break at last!\r\n\r\nOur thanks to T. Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton\'s Defense of Carnality\r\nby Jack Foley\r\n\r\nTruly I have lost weight, I have lost weight,\r\ngrown lean in loves defense,\r\nin loves defense grown grave.\r\nIt was concupiscence that brought me to the state:\r\nall bone and a bit of skin\r\nto keep the bone within.\r\nFlesh is no heavy burden for one possessed of little\r\nand accustomed to its loss.\r\nI lean to love, which leaves me lean, till lean turn into lack.\r\nA wanton bone, I sing my song\r\nand travel where the bone is blown\r\nand extricate true love from lust\r\nas any man of wisdom must.\r\nThen wherefore should I rage\r\nagainst this pilgrimage\r\nfrom gravel unto gravel?\r\nCircuitous I travel\r\nfrom love to lack / and lack to lack,\r\nfrom lean to lack\r\nand back.\r\n\r\nJack Foley is a contemporary poet, and a damn good one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDu\r\nby Janet Kenny\r\n\r\nA wisp of old woman,\r\ncurved like a scythe,\r\ntottered to me as she\r\nfussed her shopping,\r\nher walking stick hooked\r\non her chopstick wrist.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to me then\r\nin a dried leaf voice.\r\nInaudible there\r\nin that busy street,\r\nswept by rude gales\r\nfrom passing trucks.\r\n\r\nI leaned closer to hear:\r\nMein eyes not gut.\r\ntime for bus, ven comes it?\r\nWhich bus do you want?\r\n\r\nShe smiled, shook her head\r\nthen sang to herself\r\nand somebody else,\r\ninnot German. Yiddish?\r\nWhich bus?\r\nShe leaned towards me,\r\nher tiny claw reached\r\nto stroke my face.\r\nDu she said.\r\n\r\nDu\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem by a contemporary poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n\r\nby Ann Drysdale\r\n\r\nThe print of a bare foot, the second toe\r\nA little longer than the one which is\r\nTraditionally designated great.\r\nPraxiteles would have admired it.\r\n\r\nYou must have left in haste; your last wet step\r\nBefore boarding your suit and setting sail,\r\nOutlined in talcum on the bathroom floor\r\nMocks your habitual fastidiousness.\r\n\r\nThere is no tide here to obliterate\r\nYour oversight. Unless I wipe or sweep\r\nOr suck it up, it will not go away.\r\nThe thought delights me. I will keep the footprint.\r\n\r\nToo slight, too simply human to be called\r\nToken or promise; I am keeping it\r\nBecause it is a precious evidence\r\nThat on this island I am not alone.\r\n\r\nAnn Drysdale is one of our better contemporary poets, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation in the Woods\r\nby Don Thackrey\r\n\r\nHe walks into the woods to meditate\r\nOn Fall and what it presages for him\r\nAs Summer\'s candles flare and immolate\r\nThemselves, then sputter feebly as they dim.\r\n\r\nHe listens to the whispering of leaves\r\nRehearsing striking colors in surrender,\r\nThen notes a wheeling hawk that screams and grieves\r\nTo mock the season\'s bold deceits of splendor;\r\n\r\nFor soon enough the woods, the hawk, and he\r\nWill crowd together in the whited vault\r\nThat Fall constructs each year for life\'s debris.\r\nWith rue he ponders how Mankind\'s first fault\r\n\r\nBrought Death into the World, and all our woe . . .\r\nBut darkling thrush and dancing daffodil:\r\nAre they to be in thrall to debts we owe,\r\nMust everything that lives endure Fall\'s chill?\r\n\r\nHe asked forgiveness of the woods and bird . . .\r\nBut if they answered him, we haven\'t heard.\r\n\r\nDon Thackrey spent his formative years on farms and ranches of the Nebraska Sandhills before \r\nmodern conveniences, and much of his verse reflects that experience. He now \r\nlives in Dexter, Michigan, where he is retired from the University of Michigan. \r\nHis verse has appeared in a number of journals and anthologies. His prose \r\nincludes a book on Emily Dickinson.A volume of his verse is forthcoming from \r\nthe Dakota Institute Press. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best sonnets ever, according to me.
