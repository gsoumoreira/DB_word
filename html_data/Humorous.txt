Types of light verse include limericks, \r\ndoggerel, nonsense verse, nursery rhymes, rhyming epigrams, free verse epigrams, \r\nhumorous sonnets and humorous villanelles. The best humorous poets include Ogden \r\nNash, Dorothy Parker, Edward Lear, Eugene Field, e. e. cummings, Hillaire \r\nBelloc, Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot. I have worked with the interests \r\nof students young and old in mind, so if you want to learn more about light \r\nverse, \r\nand read the exemplars, hopefully you have found the right launching pad.\r\n\r\nHumorous verse can be merely for the sake of fun, but it can also be wise and \r\nenlightening. For example:\r\n\r\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages \r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head whenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys \r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\nby Hafiz, translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nRaise your words, not their volume. \r\nRain grows flowers, not thunder.\r\nby Rumi, \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Top Ten Humorous Poems of All Time\r\n\r\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat by Edward Lear\r\nThe Walrus and The Carpenter by Lewis Carroll\r\nJabberwocky by Lewis Carroll \r\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod\r\nby Eugene Field\r\nTo a Mouse and To a Louse by Robert Burns\r\nThe Cuckoo Song by William Shakespeare (from the play Love\'s Labor Lost)\r\nMen Seldom Make Passes by Dorothy Parker\r\nThe Turtle and The Ant by Ogden Nash\r\nThe Hippopotamus and The Vulture by Hilaire Belloc\r\nA wonderful bird is the pelican by Dixon Lanier Merritt\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: You Are Old, Father William by Lewis Carroll, The Health-Food Diner by Maya Angelou,\r\nMacvity the Mystery Cat by T. S. Eliot (from the book of poems that inspired \r\nthe Broadway musical Cats), There was a young lady of Niger by \r\nEdward Lear (possibly)\r\n\r\nOne of the most common and popular forms of doggerel is the limerick. This is one of my favorite \r\nlimericks:\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady named Bright\r\nWho traveled much faster than light.\r\nShe set out one day,\r\nIn a relative way,\r\nAnd came back the previous night.\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nI find it interesting that one of the best revelations of the weirdness and \r\nzaniness of \r\nrelativity can be found in a limerick! The limerick above inspired me to pen a rejoinder:\r\n\r\nEinstein, the frizzy-haired,\r\nproved E equals MC squared.\r\nThus, all mass decreases\r\nas activity ceases.\r\nNot my mass, my ass declared!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere are some the best rhyming epigrams in the English language, penned by \r\npoets who were masters of both the language and humor:\r\n\r\nPoets aren\'t very useful\r\nBecause they aren\'t consumeful or produceful.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\n\r\nMen seldom make passes \r\nat girls who wear glasses.\r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\nRobert Frost\r\n\r\nCandy is dandy\r\nbut liquor is quicker. \r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nI am his Highness\' dog at Kew;\r\npray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\r\nAlexander Pope\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cow is of the bovine ilk;\r\nOne end is moo, the other, milk.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nHere\'s a very rare form; this is one of the best humorous villanelles (or near villanelles), written by a contemporary poet:\r\n\r\n\r\nI Have a Crush on the Devil\r\nby Rose Kelleher \r\n\r\nI have a crush on the devil, teehee!\r\nIts wrong, but those horns just do something to me,\r\nthat little mustache, the seductive goatee.\r\n\r\nIve got a crush on Beelzebub, dash it!\r\nThat arrow-tipped tail of his has such panache; it\r\nwould make a nice whip. I like watching him thrash it.\r\n\r\nIve got a longing for Lucifer, darn it!\r\nTheres something about all that Evil Incarnate,\r\nhis naked red skin like a shimmering garnet.\r\n\r\nIve got a school-girlish thing for Hells King,\r\ninfernal, eternally barbecuing!\r\nThe respectable angels just havent his zing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Lear has been called the father and the poet laureate of the limerick because he \r\nhelped popularize the form. To be frank, I believe other poets, particularly Ogden \r\nNash, have penned better limericks, but I do admire this one, which has been \r\nattributed to Lear:\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady of Niger\r\nwho smiled as she rode on a tiger;\r\nThey returned from the ride\r\nwith the lady inside,\r\nand the smile on the face of the tiger.\r\nattributed to Edward Lear and William Cosmo Monkhouse\r\n\r\nHere\'s another of my all-time favorites, which illustrates how punning wordplay \r\ncan spice up limericks:\r\n\r\nA wonderful bird is the pelican;\r\nHis beak can hold more than his belican.\r\nHe can hold in his beak\r\nEnough food for a week,\r\nThough Im damned if I know how the helican!\r\nDixon Lanier Merritt (often incorrectly \r\nascribed to Ogden Nash)\r\n\r\nThe limerick above reminds me of something Dorothy Parker once said about Oscar \r\nWilde: that when she read an especially good epigram, she always assumed Wilde \r\nwas the author. Ogden Nash holds a similar place of distinction in the pantheon \r\nof limerick writers. One thing Nash did wonderfully well was ignore the rules that often result in \r\nstiffly corseted formal poems. Nash\'s poems tend to be funny, irreverent, \r\nwhimsical and loosey-goosy. (Nash is to limericks as e. e. cummings is to sonnets.) Here are a few of Nash\'s best limericks and limerick-like poems:\r\n\r\nThere was a young belle of old Natchez\r\nWhose garments were always in patchez.\r\nWhen comments arose\r\nOn the state of her clothes,\r\nShe replied, When Ah itchez, Ah scratchez.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nA flea and a fly in a flue\r\nWere imprisoned, so what could they do?\r\nSaid the fly, let us flee!\r\nLet us fly! said the flea.\r\nSo they flew through a flaw in the flue.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThe ant has made himself illustrious\r\nThrough constant industry industrious.\r\nSo what?\r\nWould you be calm and placid\r\nIf you were full of formic acid?\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nI like the duck-billed platypus\r\nBecause it is anomalous.\r\nI like the way it raises its family:\r\nPartly birdly, partly mammaly.\r\nI like its independent attitude.\r\nLet no one call it a duck-billed platitude.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nWhales have calves,\r\nCats have kittens,\r\nBears have cubs,\r\nBats have bittens,\r\nSwans have cygnets,\r\nSeals have puppies,\r\nBut guppies just have little guppies.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThe ostrich roams the great Sahara.\r\nIts mouth is wide, its neck is narra.\r\nIt has such long and lofty legs,\r\nI\'m glad it sits to lay its eggs.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nSome primal termite knocked on wood\r\nAnd tasted it, and found it good!\r\nAnd that is why your Cousin May\r\nFell through the parlor floor today.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThe wasp and all his numerous family\r\nI look upon as a major calamity.\r\nHe throws open his nest with prodigality,\r\nBut I distrust his waspitality.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThere is something about a Martini,\r\nA tingle remarkably pleasant;\r\nA yellow, a mellow Martini;\r\nI wish I had one at present.\r\nThere is something about a Martini,\r\nEre the dining and dancing begin,\r\nAnd to tell you the truth,\r\nIt is not the vermouth\r\nI think that perhaps it\'s the gin.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThere are more poems by Nash elsewhere on this page. If we give credit to Lear for \r\npopularizing the form, shouldn\'t we give even more credit to Nash for perfecting \r\nit? In any case, moving on, some of the best limericks are naughty poems \r\nwritten by the greatest of all poets, Anonymous:\r\n\r\nThere was a young man from Savannah\r\nWho died in a curious manner:\r\nHe whittled a hole\r\nIn a telephone pole\r\nAnd electrified his banana.\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nThere was a young gal name of Sally\r\nWho loved an occasional dally.\r\nShe sat on the lap\r\nOf a well-endowed chap\r\nCrying, Gee, Dick, you\'re right up my alley!\r\nAnonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nA pious young lady of Chichester \r\nMade all the pale saints in their niches stir. \r\nAnd each morning at matin \r\nHer breast in pink satin \r\nMade the bishop of Chichester\'s breeches stir.\r\nAnonymous (I also touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nHere Lies Archeanassa\r\nby\r\nAsclepiades\r\n\r\nHere lies Archeanassa\r\nthe courtesan of Colophon\r\nwhose old and wrinkled body\r\nwas still love\'s proud domain.\r\n\r\nYou lovers who knew her youth\r\nin its sweet piercing splendor\r\nand plucked those early blooms\r\nthrough what a flame you passed!\r\n\r\nThe last poem above is not a limerick, but it illustrates that poems with sexual \r\nthemes have been around for a long time:\r\nAsclepiades was an ancient Greek poet who lived circa 129-40 BC.\r\nAs one critic put it, the limerick is the vehicle of cultivated, unrepressed sexual humor in \r\nthe English language. But while some experts claim that the only real limerick is an \r\nobscene or bawdy one, the form \r\nreally took off initially, in terms of popularity, as a vehicle for nonsense verse and children\'s poems, such as the \r\nMother Goose nursery rhymes:\r\n\r\nHickory dickory dock,\r\nthe mouse ran up the clock;\r\nthe clock struck one\r\nand down he run;\r\nhickory dickory dock. \r\nMother Goose\r\n\r\nThere was an Old Man with a beard, \r\nWho said, It is just as I feared!\r\nTwo Owls and a Hen,\r\nFour Larks and a Wren,\r\nHave all built their nests in my beard!\r\nEdward Lear\r\n\r\nThere once was a leopardess, Dot,\r\nwho indignantly answered: Ill not!\r\nThe gents are impressed\r\nwith the way that Im dressed.\r\nI wouldnt change even one spot.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow, let\'s take a closer look at the various forms of poetic epigrams:\r\n\r\nYour children need your presence \r\nmore than your presents.\r\nJesse \r\nJackson\r\n\r\nJackson\'s epigram is a pun, or word-play. Parker\'s rhyming epigram is a stellar \r\nexample of raillery, which has been defined as light, teasing banter, gentle \r\nmockery and good-humored satire or ridicule. It is also an example of \r\ndrollery: something whimsically comical. Raillery has also been successfully \r\nemployed by comedians like Don Rickles and Joan Rivers (not always so gently!). \r\nRaillery can often be found in political humor:\r\n\r\n\r\nTeddy Roosevelt spoke softly and carried a big stick; \r\nDonald Trump speaks loudly \r\nand carries a big shtick.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDubious politicians have long inspired satirical jokes in the form of puns and \r\nlimericks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Best Donald Trump Jokes, Tweets and Quotations\r\n\r\nHere\'s a bit of rather gentle raillery of my own, called Saving Graces:\r\n\r\nLifes saving graces are love, pleasure, laughter ...\r\nwisdom, it seems, is for the Hereafter.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy epigram is dedicated to Christians who claim they\'ll inherit heaven at the \r\nexpense of everyone else. (If you question the idea that Einstein and Gandhi will go to hell, please \r\nconsider:\r\nWhy hell is vanishing from the \r\nBible.)\r\nThe epigram is the simple, elegant black dress of literature; it leaves nearly everything \r\nbared and yet still temptingly open to the imagination. The best \r\nepigrammatists produce belle lettres ("beautiful letters" or "fine \r\nwriting") en brief (in brief). But there is as much diversity among epigrammatists as there is in the sea. Take \r\nthe \r\none below from the master of relativity himself, Albert Einstein. Einstein, who was \r\nquite the ladies\' man, was asked to explain relativity. He chose to describe the \r\nperception of time as an aspect of \r\nhuman nature and physical attraction:\r\n\r\nSit next to a pretty girl for an hour, \r\nit seems like a minute. \r\nSit on a red-hot \r\nstove for a minute, \r\nit seems like an hour. \r\nThat\'s relativity!\r\nAlbert Einstein\r\n\r\nAnother popular form of the epigram is the limerick. Here\'s one that delves into the \r\nzanier aspects of relativity:\r\n\r\nThere once was a woman named Bright\r\nwho traveled much faster than light.\r\nShe set out one day\r\nin a relative way\r\nand came back the previous night!\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nI find it intriguing that one of the best revelations of the weirdness and \r\nzaniness of \r\nrelativity can be found in a limerick. The limerick above inspired me to pen a rejoinder:\r\n\r\nEinstein, the frizzy-haired,\r\nclaimed E equals MC squared,\r\nthus, all mass decreases\r\nas activity ceases ...\r\nnot my mass, my ass declared!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEinstein\'s epigram might be assigned any of a number of sub-terms: leg-pulling, \r\nhorseplay, whimsy, a monkeyshine . . . perhaps even a\r\nhoodwink, boondoggle or snow job (since the "relativity" being discussed \r\nhas little to do with physics, but much to do with physiques, body \r\nchemistry and sex). Still, Einstein\'s epigram, whatever we choose to call it, contains considerable \r\nwisdom. But sometimes epigrams can be entirely for amusement, such as this \r\none of mine:\r\n\r\nNun Fun Undone\r\n\r\nAbbesses\'\r\nrecesses\r\nare not for excesses!\r\n\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn epigram like mine that is entirely for the sake of humor might earn \r\nsobriquets like: tomfoolery, buffoonery, mummery, a chestnut, a gag, a ha-ha, a \r\njape, a jest, a lark, a rib, a sally, a quirk, a whim, a vagary.\r\nOne of the funnier types of epigram is the spoonerism, a genre of the pun, \r\nor word-play:\r\n\r\nI\'d rather have a bottle in front of me \r\nthan a frontal lobotomy.\r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nOther types of epigrams play on words. A similar category is the chiasmus, which repeats \r\nthe same or very similar words in a different order, often to scintillating effect: \r\n\r\nIt\'s not the size of the dog in the fight that counts, \r\nit\'s the size of the \r\nfight in the dog.\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\n\r\nIt\'s not the men in your life that count, \r\nit\'s the life in your men.\r\nMae West\r\n\r\nIn effect, a spoonerism is an aural chiasmus: the sounds of words are reversed, rather \r\nthan the same or similar words being reversed. Then there is short light verse: poetry \r\ntoo un-serious about itself and its aims to assume literary airs. In its \r\nsilliest and least literary forms, light verse may be called doggerel. Masters \r\nof English light verse include Lord Byron (the author of Don Juan) and my personal favorite, Ogden Nash:\r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks\r\nwhich practically conceal its sex.\r\nI think it clever of the turtle\r\nin such a fix to be so fertile.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\n\r\nI like the duck-billed platypus\r\nBecause it is anomalous.\r\nI like the way it raises its family:\r\nPartly birdly, partly mammaly.\r\nI like its independent attitude.\r\nLet no one call it a duck-billed platitude.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus\r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nI shoot the Hippopotamus\r\nWith bullets made of platinum,\r\nBecause if I use leaden ones\r\nHis hide is sure to flatten \'em.\r\n\r\nAnother genre of epigrams engages in \r\nparody and lampooning. Here\'s one I hope to someday include it in a book of \r\npoems to be titled Why I Left the Religious Right:\r\n\r\nI\'ve got Jesus\'s name on a wallet insert\r\nand Hell is for Queers on the back of my shirt\r\nand I uphold the Law,\r\nfor grace has a flaw:\r\nthe Church must have someone to drag through the dirt.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nYet another class of epigram (although one that is generally less entertaining) \r\nhas any number of names. Let\'s begin with "proverb" and a famous illustration by one \r\nof the world\'s best-known epigrammatists:\r\n\r\nEarly to bed, early to rise\r\nmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\r\nBen Franklin\r\n\r\nMiguel de Cervantes defined a proverb as a short sentence based on long \r\nexperience. There are, it seems, a bazillion other names for such bits of homey \r\nwisdom: adage, moral, homily, bromide, aphorism, apophthegm, axiom, dictum, \r\nmaxim, motto, folk wisdom, platitude, motto, precept, saw, saying, truism, \r\ncatchphrase, formula, gnome, pithy saying, etc. But alas!, many proverbs are \r\nboring and some are untrue, to boot. How many men got up early every morning, \r\nwere poor as dirt, and died early deaths? Surely multitudes! But many epigrams \r\ncontain both vital wisdom and sparkling humor. \r\n\r\nTo give us the most possible good material to work with, I will construe the term "epigram" to include one-liners, zingers, spoonerisms, \r\nwitticisms, aphorisms, saws, pithy sayings, epitaphs, epithets, proverbs, \r\ndoggerel, the chiasmus (I decline to use the strange plural: chiasmi), brief \r\nquotes, short poems, hillbilly humor, maxims, truisms, the wisdom of the ages, etc. I \r\nwill take as my motto and my guiding light:\r\n\r\nBrevity is the soul of wit.William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nOne takes one\'s literary life into one\'s own hands when one attempts to go beyond \r\nthe Masters, but then again "nothing ventured, nothing gained" (an \r\nepigram and a perfectly good truism), so please allow me to suggest that:\r\n\r\nIf brevity is the soul of wit\r\nthen brevity and levity\r\nare the whole of it.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBut then a good epigrammatist won\'t let us wriggle easily off the hook of a \r\nquick assumption:\r\n\r\nBrevity is the soul of lingerie.Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nThe great epigrammatists will invariably do one of two things: they will either \r\namuse and bemuse us into wisdom, or they will scathe us into wisdom. Let me give \r\nsome quick examples to illustrate what I mean, before we launch this Enterprise \r\noff for the stars, to battle the Klingons (pun on "cling-ons"):\r\n\r\n\r\nA hangover is the wrath of grapes.Unknown\r\n\r\nTo be safe on the Fourth,\r\nDon\'t buy a fifth on the third.\r\nJames H Muehlbauer\r\n\r\nBelow is my favorite among my own epigrams; it illustrates, perhaps, how \r\nmuch can be squeezed into a tight compartment while still leaving \r\nbreathing room for "special \r\neffects" like meter, rhyme and alliteration:\r\n\r\nIf God \r\nis good\r\nhalf the Bible \r\nis libel. \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn brief, the epigram is the Harry Houdini of literature. \r\n \r\n\r\nAn\r\nEpigram about Epigrams, giving Honor where Honor is Due\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, with the literate, I am\r\nImpelled to try an epigram,\r\nI never seek to take the credit;\r\nWe all assume that Oscar said it.\r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nDorothy Parker is both succinct and correct: If I hear a really good epigram \r\nand can\'t immediately identify its source, my first guess will almost invariably be the \r\nDivine Oscar Wilde. So without further ado, let\'s kick off this show by \r\nsurrendering the stage to the greatest epigrammatist of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oscar Goes to Wilde: Humorous Epigrams by the Divine\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde\r\n\r\nOne should always play fairly, \r\n\r\nwhen one has the winning cards.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. \r\nIt is never any use to \r\noneself.\r\n\r\nQuestions are never indiscreet, \r\nanswers sometimes are.\r\n\r\nDemocracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people \r\nby the people \r\nfor the \r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, \r\nit is always from the noblest motives.\r\n\r\nAlways forgive your enemies: \r\nnothing annoys them so much.\r\n\r\nThere is no sin \r\nexcept stupidity.\r\n\r\nEvery saint has a past \r\nand every sinner has a future.\r\n\r\nWe are all in the gutter, \r\nbut some of us are looking at the stars.\r\n\r\nThe public is wonderfully tolerant. \r\nIt forgives everything except genius.\r\n\r\nIf every witty thing thats said was true,\r\nOscar Wilde, the world would worship You!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Twain Well Met: Humorous Epigrams by \r\nMark \r\nTwain\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s not the parts of the Bible that I don\'t understand that bother me, \r\nit\'s the parts I do understand.\r\n\r\nTo be good is noble; \r\nbut to show others how to be good is nobler and less trouble.\r\n\r\nAlways do right. \r\nThat will gratify some of the people, and astonish the rest.\r\n\r\nBy trying we can easily learn to endure adversity. \r\nAnother man\'s, I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvidence protects children and idiots. \r\nI know because I have tested it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\'t like to commit myself about heaven and hell; \r\nI have friends in both places.\r\n\r\nEpigrams about Epigrams\r\n\r\nWhat is an epigram? A dwarfish whole;\r\nIts body brevity, and wit its soul.\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nSince brevity is the soul of wit,\r\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\r\nI will be brief.\r\nWilliam Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write an epigram, cram.\r\nIf you lack wit, scram!\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nEpigrammatic Poems about Poets and Poetry:\r\n\r\nI\'m tired of Love: I\'m still more tired of Rhyme.\r\nBut Money gives me pleasure all the time.\r\nHilaire Belloc\r\n\r\nPoets aren\'t very useful\r\nBecause they aren\'t consumeful or produceful.\r\nOgden Nash\r\n\r\nReaders and listeners praise my books;\r\nYou swear they\'re worse than a beginner\'s.\r\nWho cares? I always plan my dinners\r\nTo please the diners, not the cooks.\r\nMarcus Valerius Martial, translated by R. L. Barth\r\n\r\nThough Edgar Poe writes a lucid prose\r\nJust and rhetorical without exertion,\r\nIt loses all lucidity, God knows,\r\nIn the single, poorly rendered English version.\r\nThom Gunn\r\n\r\n\r\nDowager Power\r\n\r\nHere lies my wife: here let her lie!\r\nNow she\'s at restand so am I.\r\nJohn Dryden\r\n\r\nThe Death of Class\r\n\r\nI am his Highness\' dog at Kew;\r\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\r\nAlexander Pope\r\n\r\nHe first deceased; she for a little tried\r\nTo live without him, liked it not, and died.\r\nSir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), on the death of Sir Albert Morton\'s wife\r\n\r\nHer whole life is an epigram: smack smooth, and neatly penned,\r\nPlatted quite neat to catch applause, with a sliding noose at the end.\r\nWilliam Blake\r\n\r\nErrors and Terrors\r\n\r\n\r\nTreason doth never prosper; what\'s the reason?\r\nFor if it prosper, none dare call it treason.\r\nSir John Harrington\r\n\r\nThe Errors of a Wise Man make your Rule\r\nRather than the Perfections of a Fool.\r\nWilliam Blake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nType Cast\r\n\r\na politician is an arse upon\r\nwhich everyone has sat except a man\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nThis Humanist whom no beliefs constrained\r\nGrew so broad-minded he was scatter-brained.\r\nJ.
