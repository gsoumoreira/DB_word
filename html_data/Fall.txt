Masters of autumnal \r\nand winter poetry include the aptly named Robert Frost, Louise Bogan, \r\nWilliam Blake, Hart Crane, Emily Dickinson, Ernest Dowson, Robert Herrick, A. E. Housman, Thomas \r\nHardy, Robert Hayden, John Keats, D. H. Lawrence, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edna St. Vincent Millay, \r\nChristina Rossetti, William \r\nShakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Wallace Stevens, Sara Teasdale, Dylan Thomas, \r\nWilliam Butler Yeats, and others who appear on this page. \r\n\r\nHere are my personal (and therefore obviously subjective) top ten poems \r\nabout autumn and winter:\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\r\nGo, Lovely Rose by Edmund Waller\r\nA Last Word by Ernest Dowson\r\nSong for the Last Act by Louise Bogan\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole by William Butler Yeats\r\nBread and Music by Conrad Aiken\r\nOde to Autumn by John Keats\r\nOde to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\nSonnet 73 (That time of year thou mayest in me behold) by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: \r\nTo the Virgins, to Make Much of Time and To Daffodils by Robert Herrick, \r\nTears, Idle Tears by Lord Alfred Tennyson, Luke Havergal by Edward Arlington \r\nRobinson, To Autumn by William Blake, The Autumn by Elizabeth Barrett \r\nBrowning, Among the Rocks by Robert Browning, Autumn by John Clare, \r\nOctober by Edward Thomas, Thanksgiving Time by Langston Hughes, Autumn \r\nFires by Robert Louis Stevenson, Highway Apple Trees by Rhina P.

Burch\r\n\r\nIt\'s not that every leaf must finally fall . . .\r\nit\'s just that we can never catch them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n      Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\n    The day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\n    And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\n    Despair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\n    Broods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\n    Laughter or tears, for we have only known\r\n    Surpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\n    Have driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\n    Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\n    To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\n    Find end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\n    Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\n    Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\n    Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGathering Leaves \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nSpades take up leaves \r\nNo better than spoons, \r\nAnd bags full of leaves \r\nAre light \r\nas balloons.\r\n\r\nI make a great noise \r\nOf rustling all day \r\nLike rabbit and deer \r\nRunning away.\r\n\r\nBut the mountains I raise \r\nElude my embrace, \r\nFlowing over my arms \r\nAnd into my \r\nface.\r\n\r\nI may load and unload \r\nAgain and again \r\nTill I fill the whole shed, \r\nAnd what have \r\nI then?\r\n\r\nNext to nothing for weight, \r\nAnd since they grew duller \r\nFrom contact with earth, \r\n\r\nNext to nothing for color.\r\n\r\nNext to nothing for use. \r\nBut a crop is a crop, \r\nAnd who\'s to say where \r\nThe \r\nharvest shall stop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long\r\n    duration Horace\r\n    \r\n    They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\n    Love and desire and hate:\r\n    I think they have no portion in us after\r\n    We pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\n    Out of a misty dream\r\n    Our path emerges for a while, then closes\r\n    Within a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act \r\n \r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf Fall\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhatever winds encountered soon resolved\r\nto swirling fragments, till chaotic heaps\r\nof leaves lay pulsing by the backyard wall.\r\nIn lieu of rakes, our fingers sorted each\r\ndry leaf into its place and built a high,\r\nsoft bastion against earth\'s gravitron\r\na patchwork quilt, a trampoline, a bright\r\nimpediment to fling ourselves upon.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing in our laughter as we fell\r\ninto those leaves was like the autumn\'s cry\r\nof also falling. Nothing meant to die\r\ncould be so bright as we, so colorful\r\nclad in our plaids, oblivious to pain\r\nwe\'d feel today, should we leaf-fall again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man  \r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad \r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Frosts\r\n\r\nby T. Merrill \r\n\r\n\r\nFramed in my front slider now, \r\nmaples masquerading as giant \r\nforsythias in full bloom \r\nwill very soon be revealing how \r\nan early leaf\'s a short-lived flower.\r\n\r\nBut greater than any loss I prevision\r\nin April\'s fleeting golden hour\r\nis a building promise of release \r\nfrom another eternal winter\'s prison, \r\nwide-open doors and the long-awaited\r\n\r\nwarm luxurious freedom of being\r\npart of the scene again, at least\r\ntill its culminant powers unfold a final\r\ntapestry made to fade away . . .\r\nin earth\'s perennial pageant of decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 11 from Word from the Hills\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nYou were so solid, father, cold and raw\r\nas these north winters, where your angry will\r\nfirst hardened, as the earth when the long chill\r\ndeepensas is this country\'s cruel law\r\nyet under trackless snow, without a flaw\r\ncovering meadow, road, and stubbled hill,\r\nthe springs and muffled streams were running still,\r\ndark until spring came, and the awful thaw.\r\nIn your decay a gentleness appears\r\nI hadn\'t guessedwhen, gray as rotting snow,\r\npropped in your chair, your face will run with tears,\r\ntrying to speak, and your hand, stiff and slow,\r\nwill touch my childwho, sensing the cold years\r\nin your eyes, cries until you let her go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSomething inescapable is lost\r\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\r\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\r\nimmeasurable and void.\r\n\r\nSomething uncapturable is gone\r\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\r\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\r\nand remembrance.\r\n\r\nSomething unforgettable is past\r\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\r\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\r\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tide Rises, The Tide Falls\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide rises, the tide falls,\r\nThe twilight darkens, the curlew calls;\r\nAlong the sea-sands damp and brown\r\nThe traveller hastens toward the town,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nDarkness settles on roofs and walls,\r\nBut the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;\r\nThe little waves, with their soft, white hands,\r\nEfface the footprints in the sands,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nThe morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls\r\nStamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;\r\nThe day returns, but nevermore\r\nReturns the traveller to the shore,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veil\r\n\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nHow\'s one to see\r\nrightly that tree,\r\nthat flat illusion\r\nand deep confusion\r\nof branch, twig, splinter\r\nstripped bare for winter,\r\nstanding black, bold\r\nin winter\'s cold\r\nand gray sky\'s gloom\r\noutside my room?\r\nThinking I\'ll prove\r\nit real, I move\r\nmy head south, north,\r\nto bring it forth\r\nand so, reveal\r\nits depth, its feel.\r\nMen rearrange\r\ntheir thoughts thus. Strange\r\nhow intricately\r\nit moves . . . like me\r\nme more than any\r\nbeneath the Many\r\nit is the One,\r\nthe skeleton\r\nits trunk, its stark\r\nand mottled bark\r\nraccoons and wind\r\nhave ripped and skinned\r\nand left to die . . .\r\nBut it\'s not I\r\nwho can define\r\nits shape, or mine.\r\n\r\nAfter this frost\r\nall will be lost\r\nin a strange scene\r\nof savage green\r\nwhen it receives\r\nits destined leaves\r\nthat charm the eyes\r\nas the ears lies\r\nthat poets tell.\r\nAll will be well:\r\nfor we shall see\r\nin greenery\r\nin sun, in gale\r\nits face, its veil,\r\ndrape upon drape;\r\nits truest shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore \r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad \r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep \r\nmonotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard \r\ndaylight steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music  \r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano  \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition \r\n  of these faces  in the\r\n  crowd:\r\nPetals  on a wet,\r\n  black  bough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Playground\r\n\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nOver the playground where\r\nancient and wizened trees\r\ntouch odors to the air\r\nto draw the latest bees,\r\n\r\nchildren swarm on the lawn,\r\nmuss the grass with their toes. . .\r\nWhat can they touch of dawn\r\nwhat sweetnessas it goes?\r\n\r\nDew, that will turn to tears\r\nand trickle through their sleep\r\nand through their future years,\r\n\r\ntill they, they too, are old\r\nand in their wisdom weep\r\na honey dark and cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong \r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nXLVIIFor My Funeral\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nO thou that from thy mansion\r\n  Through time and place to roam,\r\nDost send abroad thy children,\r\n  And then dost call them home,\r\n\r\nThat men and tribes and nations\r\n  And all thy hand hath made\r\nMay shelter them from sunshine\r\n  In thine eternal shade:\r\n\r\nWe now to peace and darkness\r\n  And earth and thee restore\r\nThy creature that thou madest\r\n  And wilt cast forth no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nThe mill-stream, now that noises cease,\r\nIs all that does not hold its peace;\r\nUnder the bridge it murmurs by,\r\nAnd here are night and hell and I.\r\n\r\nWho made the world I cannot tell;\r\n\'Tis made, and here I am in hell.\r\nMy hand, though now my knuckles bleed,\r\nI never soiled with such a deed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, no doubt, in time gone by,\r\nSome have suffered more than I,\r\nWho only spend the night alone\r\nAnd strike my fist upon the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n XXI\r\n\r\n by A.

Housman\r\n\r\nThe world goes none the lamer\r\n  For ought that I can see,\r\nBecause this cursed trouble\r\n  Has struck my days and me.\r\n\r\nThe stars of heaven are steady,\r\n  The founded hills remain,\r\nThough I to earth and darkness\r\n  Return in blood and pain.\r\n\r\nFarewell to all belongings\r\n  I won or bought or stole;\r\nFarewell, my lusty carcase,\r\n  Farewell, my aery soul.\r\n\r\nOh worse remains for others\r\n  And worse to fear had I\r\nThan here at four-and-twenty\r\n  To lay me down and die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge by Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirective by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\r\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\r\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\r\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\r\nThere is a house that is no more a house\r\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\r\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\r\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\r\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\r\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry \r\nGreat monolithic knees the former town\r\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\r\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\r\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\r\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\r\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\r\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\r\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\r\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\r\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\r\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\r\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\r\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\r\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\r\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\r\nThey think too much of having shaded out\r\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\r\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\r\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\r\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\r\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\r\nThe height of the adventure is the height\r\nOf country where two village cultures faded\r\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExile\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nMy hands have not touched pleasure since your hands,\r\nNo,nor my lips freed laughter since \'farewell\',\r\nAnd with the day, distance again expands\r\nVoiceless between us, as an uncoiled shell.\r\n\r\nYet love endures, though starving and alone.\r\nA dove\'s wings cling about my heart each night\r\nWith surging gentleness, and the blue stone\r\nSet in the tryst-ring has but worn more bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nBecause I liked you better\r\n  Than suits a man to say,\r\nIt irked you, and I promised\r\n  To throw the thought away.\r\n\r\nTo put the world between us\r\n  We parted, stiff and dry;\r\n\'Good-bye,\' said you, \'forget me.\'\r\n  \'I will, no fear\', said I.\r\n\r\nIf here, where clover whitens\r\n  The dead man\'s knoll, you pass,\r\nAnd no tall flower to meet you\r\n  Starts in the trefoiled grass,\r\n\r\nHalt by the headstone naming\r\n  The heart no longer stirred,\r\nAnd say the lad that loved you\r\n  Was one that kept his word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fitful Alternations Of The Rain \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nThe fitful alternations of the rain,\r\nWhen the chill wind, languid as with pain\r\nOf its own heavy moisture, here and there\r\nDrives through the gray and beamless atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solitary by Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nMy heart has grown rich with the passing of years,\r\n I have less need now than when I was young \r\nTo share myself with every comer\r\n Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.\r\nIt is one to me that they come or go\r\n If I have myself and the drive of my will,\r\nAnd strength to climb on a summer night\r\n And watch the stars swarm over the hill.\r\nLet them think I love them more than I do,\r\n Let them think I care, though I go alone;\r\nIf it lifts their pride, what is it to me\r\n Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\r\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\r\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose \r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtue\r\nby George Herbert\r\n\r\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\r\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\r\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\nFor thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\nThy root is ever in its grave,\r\nAnd thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\r\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\r\nAnd all must die.\r\n\r\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\r\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\r\nThen chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Steal by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\r\n I had no human fears:\r\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\r\n The touch of earthly years.\r\n\r\nNo motion has she now, no force;\r\n She neither hears nor sees;\r\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\r\n With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s wife had waited long,\r\nThe tea was cold, the fire was dead;\r\nAnd there might yet be nothing wrong\r\nIn how he went and what he said:\r\nThere are no millers any more,\r\nWas all that she had heard him say;\r\nAnd he had lingered at the door\r\nSo long it seemed like yesterday.\r\nSick with a fear that had no form\r\nShe knew that she was there at last;\r\nAnd in the mill there was a warm\r\nAnd mealy fragrance of the past.\r\nWhat else there was would only seem\r\nTo say again what he had meant;\r\nAnd what was hanging from a beam\r\nWould not have heeded where she went.\r\nAnd if she thought it followed her,\r\nShe may have reasoned in the dark\r\nThat one way of the few there were\r\nWould hide her and would leave no mark:\r\nBlack water, smooth above the weir\r\nLike starry velvet in the night,\r\nThough ruffled once, would soon appear\r\nThe same as ever to the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April \r\n Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, \r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted, \r\n I shall not care. \r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful \r\n When rain bends down the bough; \r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted \r\n Than you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose by Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving \r\nby George Gordon, Lord \r\nByron\r\n\r\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n So late into the night,\r\nThough the heart be still as loving,\r\n And the moon be still as bright.\r\n\r\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\r\n And the soul outwears the breast,\r\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\r\n And love itself have rest.\r\n\r\nThough the night was made for loving,\r\n And the day returns too soon,\r\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n By the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks \r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\r\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\r\n\r\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\r\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\r\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\r\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\r\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\r\n\r\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\r\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\r\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\r\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\r\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredo\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nI cannot find my way: there is no star\r\nIn all the shrouded heavens anywhere;\r\nAnd there is not a whisper in the air\r\nOf any living voice but one so far\r\nThat I can hear it only as a bar\r\nOf lost, imperial music, played when fair\r\nAnd angel fingers wove, and unaware,\r\nDead leaves to garlands where no roses are.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a glimmer, nor a call,\r\nFor one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears,\r\nThe black and awful chaos of the night;\r\nFor through it allabove, beyond it all\r\nI know the far sent message of the years,\r\nI feel the coming glory of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMother Night \r\nby James Weldon Johnson\r\n\r\nEternities before the first-born day,\r\nOr ere the first sun fledged his wings of flame,\r\nCalm Night, the everlasting and the same,\r\nA brooding mother over chaos lay.\r\nAnd whirling suns shall blaze and then decay,\r\nShall run their fiery courses and then claim\r\nThe haven of the darkness whence they came;\r\nBack to Nirvanic peace shall grope their way.\r\n\r\nSo when my feeble sun of life burns out,\r\nAnd sounded is the hour for my long sleep,\r\nI shall, full weary of the feverish light,\r\nWelcome the darkness without fear or doubt,\r\nAnd heavy-lidded, I shall softly creep\r\nInto the quiet bosom of the Night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring and Fall, to a Young Child \r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret, are you grieving \r\nOver Goldengrove unleaving? \r\nLeaves, like the things of man, you \r\nWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you? \r\nAh! as the heart grows older \r\nIt will come to such sights colder \r\nBy and by, nor spare a sigh \r\nThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie; \r\nAnd yet you will weep and know why. \r\nNow no matter, child, the name: \r\nSorrow\'s springs are the same. \r\nNor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed \r\nWhat h\xe9art h\xe9ard of, gh\xf3st gu\xe9ssed: \r\nIt is the blight man was born for, \r\nIt is Margaret you mourn for. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution \r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be \r\n\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\r\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\r\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\r\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\r\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\r\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\r\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\r\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\r\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\r\nNever have relish in the faery power\r\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\r\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\r\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInto the Twilight\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nOut-worn heart, in a time out-worn,\r\nCome clear of the nets of wrong and right;\r\nLaugh, heart, again in the grey twilight;\r\nSigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.\r\n\r\nYour mother Eire is always young,\r\nDew ever shining and twilight grey;\r\nThough hope fall from you and love decay,\r\nBurning in fires of a slanderous tongue.\r\n\r\nCome, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:\r\nFor there the mystical brotherhood\r\nOf sun and moon and hollow and wood\r\nAnd river and stream work out their will;\r\n\r\nAnd God stands winding His lonely horn,\r\nAnd time and the world are ever in flight;\r\nAnd love is less kind than the grey twilight,\r\nAnd hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Immortality\r\nby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\n I saw a dead man\'s finer part\r\nShining within each faithful heart\r\nOf those bereft. Then said I: This \r\nmust be\r\nHis immortality. \r\n \r\n I looked there as the seasons \r\nwore\r\nAnd still his soul continuously bore\r\nA life in theirs. But less its shine \r\nexcelled\r\n Than when I first beheld.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-yearsmen passed, and \r\nthen\r\nIn later hearts I looked for him \r\nagain;\r\nAnd found himshrunk, alas! into a \r\nthin\r\n And spectral mannikin.\r\n\r\n Lastly I asknow old and chill\r\nIf aught of him remain unperished \r\nstill;\r\nAnd find, in me alone, a feeble \r\nspark,\r\n Dying amid the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsolde\'s Song\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThrough our long years of dreaming to be one\r\nwe grew toward an enigmatic light\r\nthat gently warmed our tendrils. Was it sun?\r\nWe had no eyes to tell; we loved despite\r\nthe lack of all sensationall but one: \r\nwe felt the night\'s deep chill, the air so bright\r\nat dawn we quivered limply, overcome.\r\n\r\nTo touch was all we knew, and how to bask.\r\nWe knew to touch; we grew to touch; we felt\r\nspring\'s urgency, midsummer\'s heat, fall\'s lash,\r\nwild winter\'s ice and thaw and fervent melt.\r\nWe felt returning light and could not ask\r\nits meaning, or if something was withheld\r\nmore glorious. To touch seemed life\'s great task.\r\n\r\nAt last the petal of me learned: unfold.\r\nAnd you were there, surrounding me. We touched.\r\nThe curious golden pollens! Ah, we touched,\r\nand learned to cling and, finally, to hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highwayman\r\n\r\n\r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE wind was a torrent of darkness among the \r\ngusty trees, \r\nThe moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, \r\nThe road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, \r\nAnd the highwayman came riding \r\n           Ridingriding \r\nThe highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door. \r\nII \r\nHe\'d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his \r\nchin, \r\nA coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin; \r\nThey fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh! \r\nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle, \r\n           His pistol butts a-twinkle, \r\nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky. \r\nIII \r\nOver the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard, \r\nAnd he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and \r\nbarred; \r\nHe whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there \r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. \r\nIV \r\nAnd dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked \r\nWhere Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked; \r\nHis eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay, \r\nBut he loved the landlord\'s daughter, \r\n           The landlord\'s red-lipped daughter, \r\nDumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say \r\nV \r\nOne kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I\'m after a prize to-night, \r\nBut I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; \r\nYet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day, \r\nThen look for me by moonlight, \r\n           Watch for me by moonlight, \r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way. \r\nVI \r\nHe rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand, \r\nBut she loosened her hair i\' the casement! His face burnt like a brand\r\n\r\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; \r\nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight, \r\n           (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!) \r\nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the \r\nWest. \r\nPART TWO \r\nI \r\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon; \r\nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon, \r\nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor, \r\nA red-coat troop came marching \r\n           Marchingmarching \r\nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door. \r\nII \r\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, \r\nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow \r\nbed; \r\nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! \r\nThere was death at every window; \r\n           And hell at one dark window; \r\nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would \r\nride. \r\nIII \r\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest; \r\nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\r\n\r\nNow, keep good watch! and they kissed her. \r\n           She heard the dead man say \r\nLook for me by moonlight; \r\n           Watch for me by moonlight; \r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\r\n\r\nIV \r\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! \r\nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! \r\nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by \r\nlike years, \r\nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight, \r\n           Cold, on the stroke of midnight, \r\nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! \r\nV \r\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\r\n\r\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast, \r\nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; \r\nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight; \r\n           Blank and bare in the moonlight; \r\nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s \r\nrefrain . \r\nVI \r\n Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs \r\nringing clear; \r\nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they \r\ndid not hear? \r\nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, \r\nThe highwayman came riding, \r\n           Riding, riding! \r\nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\r\n\r\nVII \r\n Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the \r\nechoing night! \r\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! \r\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, \r\nThen her finger moved in the moonlight, \r\n           Her musket shattered the moonlight, \r\nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death. \r\nVIII \r\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood \r\nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\r\n\r\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear \r\nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \r\n           The landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \r\nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness \r\nthere. \r\nIX \r\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, \r\nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\r\n\r\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet \r\ncoat, \r\nWhen they shot him down on the highway, \r\n           Down like a dog on the highway, \r\nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his \r\nthroat. \r\nX \r\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the \r\ntrees, \r\nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, \r\nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, \r\nA highwayman comes riding \r\n           Ridingriding \r\nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door. \r\nXI \r\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard; \r\nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred; \r\nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there \r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMariana by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\n Mariana in the moated grange.  Measure for Measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        With blackest moss the flower-plots\r\n         Were thickly crusted, one and all:\r\n        The rusted nails fell from the knots\r\n         That held the pear to the gable-wall.\r\n        The broken sheds lookd sad and strange:\r\n         Unlifted was the clinking latch;\r\n         Weeded and worn the ancient thatch\r\n        Upon the lonely moated grange.\r\n         She only said, My life is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\n        Her tears fell with the dews at even;\r\n         Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;\r\n        She could not look on the sweet heaven,\r\n         Either at morn or eventide.\r\n        After the flitting of the bats,\r\n         When thickest dark did trance the sky,\r\n         She drew her casement-curtain by,\r\n        And glanced athwart the glooming flats.\r\n         She only said, The night is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\nUpon the middle of the night,\r\n         Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:\r\n        The cock sung out an hour ere light:\r\n         From the dark fen the oxens low\r\n        Came to her: without hope of change,\r\n         In sleep she seemd to walk forlorn,\r\n         Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn\r\n        About the lonely moated grange.\r\n         She only said, The day is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\n        About a stone-cast from the wall\r\n         A sluice with blackend waters slept,\r\n        And oer it many, round and small,\r\n         The clusterd marish-mosses crept.\r\n        Hard by a poplar shook alway,\r\n         All silver-green with gnarled bark:\r\n         For leagues no other tree did mark\r\n        The level waste, the rounding gray.\r\n         She only said, My life is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\n        And ever when the moon was low,\r\n         And the shrill winds were up and away,\r\n        In the white curtain, to and fro,\r\n         She saw the gusty shadow sway.\r\n        But when the moon was very low,\r\n         And wild winds bound within their cell,\r\n         The shadow of the poplar fell\r\n        Upon her bed, across her brow.\r\n         She only said, The night is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\n        All day within the dreamy house,\r\n         The doors upon their hinges creakd;\r\n        The blue fly sung in the pane; the mouse\r\n         Behind the mouldering wainscot shriekd,\r\n        Or from the crevice peerd about.\r\n         Old faces glimmerd thro the doors,\r\n         Old footsteps trod the upper floors,\r\n        Old voices called her from without.\r\n         She only said, My life is dreary,\r\n         He cometh not, she said;\r\n         She said, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         I would that I were dead!\r\n\r\n        The sparrows chirrup on the roof,\r\n         The slow clock ticking, and the sound\r\n        Which to the wooing wind aloof\r\n         The poplar made, did all confound\r\n        Her sense; but most she loathed the hour\r\n         When the thick-moted sunbeam lay\r\n         Athwart the chambers, and the day\r\n        Was sloping toward his western bower.\r\n         Then, said she, I am very dreary,\r\n         He will not come, she said;\r\n         She wept, I am aweary, aweary,\r\n         Oh God, that I were dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\nUlysses  by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nIt little profits that an idle king,\r\nBy this still hearth, among these barren crags,\r\nMatched with an aged wife, I mete and dole\r\nUnequal laws unto a savage race,\r\nThat hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.\r\nI cannot rest from travel; I will drink\r\nLife to the lees.  All times I have enjoyed\r\nGreatly, have suffered greatly, both with those\r\nThat loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\r\nThrough scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\nVext the dim sea.  I am become a name;\r\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart.\r\nMuch have I seen and knowncities of men\r\nAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\nMyself not least, but honored of them all,\r\nAnd drunk delight of battle with my peers,\r\nFar on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\r\nI am a part of all that I have met;\r\nYet all experience is an arch wherethrough\r\nGleams that untraveled world whose margin fades\r\nFor ever and for ever when I move.\r\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\r\nTo rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\r\nAs though to breathe were life! Life piled on life\r\nWere all too little, and of one to me\r\nLittle remains; but every hour is saved\r\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\r\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\r\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\r\nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire\r\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\r\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\r\n This is my son, mine own Telemachus,\r\nTo whom I leave the scepter and the isle,\r\nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfill\r\nThis labor, by slow prudence to make mild\r\nA rugged people, and through soft degrees\r\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\r\nMost blameless is he, centered in the sphere\r\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\r\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\r\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\r\nWhen I am gone.  He works his work, I mine.\r\n There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\r\nThere gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\r\nSouls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,\r\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\r\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\r\nFree hearts, free foreheadsyou and I are old;\r\nOld age hath yet his honor and his toil.\r\nDeath closes all; but something ere the end,\r\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\r\nNot unbecoming men that strove with gods.\r\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\r\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\r\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\r\n\'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\r\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\r\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\r\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\r\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\r\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\r\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\r\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\r\nThough much is taken, much abides; and though\r\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\r\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,\r\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\r\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\r\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
