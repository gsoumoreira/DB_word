A quatrain is a four-line stanza, often (but not always) with a rhyme scheme. A \r\npoem may be a quatrain, or it may be composed of quatrains. Or a poem may \r\ncontain one or more quatrains along with other types of stanzas. Picking the greatest poems \r\nof a particular form is, of course, a very subjective task and almost entirely a \r\nmatter of personal taste and fancy (so if you disagree with my choices, please \r\nfeel free to compile your own). Perhaps the most interesting thing about my \r\npersonal canon is that many of the poems are fairly recent. This leads me to \r\nbelieve that the death of poetry has been greatly exaggerated. \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos is the first great female poet known to us today, and she \r\nremains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 156\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nShe keeps her scents\r\nin a dressing-case.\r\nAnd her sense?\r\nIn some undiscoverable place.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 16\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\nWarriors on rearing chargers, \r\ncolumns of infantry,\r\nfleets of warships:\r\nsome say these are the shadowy earth\'s most glorious visions.\r\nBut I say\r\nthe one I desire. \r\n\r\nIn the second poem above, Sappho may have become the earth\'s first make love, \r\nnot war poet. In any case, she was certainly far ahead of her time (and perhaps \r\nours).\r\nLyric poetry begins with (and derives its name from) short poems that were \r\neither recited or sung to the strummings of the lyre, a harp-like instrument. The most famous of the \r\nancient Greek lyric poets is Sappho, who was born on the island of \r\nLesbos around 600 BC. The homoerotic nature \r\nof some of her poems have given our modern words lesbian and sapphic  \r\ndenotations and connotations of female homosexuality.\r\nBut Sappho was far from a one-trick pony. The first poem above is timeless and might \r\nhave been written about any modern girl or woman who acts unwisely or without \r\nthinking first.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a quatrain poem that seems just as pertinent today as the day it was written:\r\n\r\nRefugee \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThese Strangers, in a foreign World, \r\nProtection asked of me\r\nBefriend them, lest Yourself in Heaven \r\nBe found a Refugee\r\n\r\nTop Ten English Language Poets Who Worked in Quatrains\r\n\r\nOgden Nash\r\nSara Teasdale\r\nThomas Gray\r\nRobert Frost\r\nEmily Dickinson\r\nWilliam Shakespeare (his sonnets consisted of three quatrains and a couplet)\r\nWallace Stevens\r\nHart Crane\r\nA.

Sunflower, Jerusalem\r\nand The Tyger by \r\nWilliam Blake\r\n\r\nA Brief History of the Quatrain \r\n\r\nA quatrain is simply a verse or stanza of four lines with an independent idea \r\nthat makes it complete in itself. We can trace quatrains back to ancient \r\ncivilizations such as Mesopotamia, China, Greece and Rome. During the dark ages \r\nin Europe, Middle Eastern poets like Omar Khayyam popularized the quatrain, \r\nwhich was called Ruba\'i in Iran; hence the Rubaiyat, as \r\nKhayyam\'s most famous work came to be known in the West. Edward FitzGerald\'s \r\ntranslation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam helped popularize the \r\nRuba\'i or Rubaiyat stanza form in the West. Here\'s a famous \r\nexample:\r\n\r\nCome, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring \r\nYour Winter garment of Repentance fling: \r\n The Bird of Time has but a little way \r\nTo flutterand the Bird is on the Wing.\r\n\r\nAmerican poets who adopted the Rubaiyat stanza form include Robert \r\nFrost in Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening and Emily Dickinson in Hope is \r\nthe thing with feathers. The most common types of quatrains in English poetry \r\nare Ballad Stanza (ABAB rhyme scheme in ballad meter or iambic tetrameter, as in \r\nThe Wife of Usher\'s Well), Heroic or Elegiac Stanza (ABAB iambic pentameter, \r\nas in Elegy Written in a Country Courtyard by Thomas Gray), Envelope Stanza \r\n(ABBA iambic tetrameter, as in Look Before You Leap by W. H. Auden), Goethe \r\nStanza (ABAB any meter, as in poems by the great German poet), Italian Quatrain \r\n(ABBA iambic pentameter, as in Italian sonnets), Sicilian Quatrain (ABAB iambic \r\npentameter, as in Italian sonnets), Hymnal Quatrain (multi-stanza with three \r\nalternating rhymes written in iambic trimeter and iambic tetrameter, as in A \r\nRed, Red Rose by Robert Burns), Redondilla (ABBA, ABAB or AABB tetrameter, as \r\nin Spanish poems), Memoriam Stanza (ABBA iambic tetrameter, as in In Memoriam \r\nA.H.H. by Alfred Tennyson), and the Pantoum (it\'s complicated!). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \r\npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne helped \r\nmake her almost as famous as he was in Ireland. The first poem below is Yeats\' \r\nloose translation of a Pierre Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \r\nlife in her later years, tending a waning fire. The second poem, The Wild Swans \r\nat Coole is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \r\nlanguage.\r\nThe first four lines comprise a lovely quatrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \r\nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. The first four lines of \r\nher most famous sonnet comprise a touching quatrain. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \r\npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \r\nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \r\nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \r\nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \r\nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, \r\nmasturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. The sonnet-like poem \r\nbelow is comprised of quatrains. \r\nThe Truth the Dead Know\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\r\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\r\n\r\nGone, I say and walk from church,\r\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\r\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\r\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\r\n\r\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\r\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\r\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\r\nand we touch. In another country people die.\r\n\r\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\r\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\r\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\r\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\r\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\r\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\r\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Her poem is two lines short of a \r\nsonnet and may be considered to consist of three quatrains. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\n\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\n\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nHere is a printable version of\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye\'s Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep which is not \r\ncopyrighted and is thus in the public domain. \r\n\r\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is the best villanelle in the English \r\nlanguage, in my opinion, and one of the most powerful and haunting poems ever \r\nwritten in any language. The most common form of the villanelle in English \r\npoetry concludes with a quatrain. \r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nEdward Thomas is not as well-known as some of the other poets on this page, but \r\nAdlestrop was among the top ten most requested poems at Poetry Please, \r\nso he continues to have fans. Adlestrop is a somewhat mysterious poem, because \r\nnothing really happens and yet it seems extraordinarily sad.\r\nIt is composed of quatrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdlestrop\r\nbyEdward Thomas\r\n\r\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\r\nThe name, because one afternoon\r\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\r\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\r\n\r\nThe steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\r\nNo one left and no one came\r\nOn the bare platform. What I saw\r\nWas Adlestroponly the name\r\n\r\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\r\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\r\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\r\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\r\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\r\nFarther and farther, all the birds\r\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most notorious married \r\ncouple of their era. He was a dashing romantic poet and heretic who wrote a \r\ntract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled from Oxford. He also \r\nwrote in favor of nonviolence and against monarchies, \r\nimperialism and war. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \r\nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \r\nGodwin. In 1814, at age seventeen, she \r\nbecame romantically involved with Percy Shelley, who was married at the time but \r\nthreatened to commit suicide if she spurned his advances. They spent time \r\ntogether in France and Switzerland; when they returned, Mary was pregnant. Percy\'s wife Harriet, who was also pregnant, committed suicide in 1816; Percy \r\nand Mary married soon thereafter. The same year they spent the summer with Lord \r\nByron. It was at this time that Mary conceived the story that became her famous \r\ngothic novel Frankenstein. In 1822, Percy drowned at sea at age thirty. Who knows what he would \r\nhave accomplished if he had lived longer, but he is still considered to be one \r\nof the greatest English poets. Here is one especially lovely example of his \r\nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \r\nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \r\nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \r\nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \r\nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \r\nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \r\nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \r\ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) The last \r\nfour lines of the sonnet below comprise an effective quatrain. \r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\r\nI shall remember you with love, or season\r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\n\r\nMillay is not just another penner of sonnets. Her sonnets sparkle with life and \r\nlust amid the foreshadowing of death. She also has an interesting quality of \r\nresolve: she seems willing to give herself to men, but not to give herself away. \r\nIf she is playing games, she is playing them knowingly, and probably understands \r\nthe rules better than her partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is one of the best unknown or under-known poets of all time. Her \r\nbest poems make her a major poet, in my opinion. She\'s a poet who deserves to be \r\nread and studied. In particular, her After the Persian, Juan\'s Song \r\nand Song for the Last Act are must reads. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was an English romantic poet, painter, illustrator and \r\ntranslator. He was also one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His \r\nart was characterized by sensuality and medieval revivalism. He frequently wrote \r\nsonnets to accompany his works of visual art. In 1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal \r\n(pictured above), who became his model, his passion, and eventually in 1860, his \r\nwife. But his sister Christina Rossetti may have been the better poet.\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nI have been here before,\r\n\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\n The sweet keen smell ...\r\n\r\nHis sister\'s famous Song below consists of four quatrains. \r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\n\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\n\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is one of my favorite \r\npoems from the good auld days of English poetry. As I translated the poem, it \r\nconsists of three quatrains, each followed by an italicized line that concludes \r\nthe stanza. \r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \r\n\r\nConrad Aiken, in his best poems, rivals Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \r\nmasters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s Bread and Music is one of my \r\nvery favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels than for his poetry, but Piano \r\nis an immortal poem, and thus makes Lawrence an immortal poet.\r\n\r\nPiano \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first and best of the modern confessional poets. She \r\nwon a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\r\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \r\npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life.\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind ...\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt has been credited with introducing the \r\nPetrarchan sonnet into the English language. His father, Henry Wyatt, had been one of Henry \r\nVII\'s Privy Councilors, and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII came to \r\nthe throne in 1509. Thomas Wyatt followed his father to court. But it seems the \r\nyoung poet may have fallen in love with the kings mistress. Many legends and \r\nconjectures suggest that an unhappily married Wyatt had a relationship with \r\nAnne Boleyn. Their acquaintance is certain, but whether or not the two \r\nactually shared a romantic relationship remains unknown. But in his poetry, Wyatt called \r\nhis mistress Anna, and sometimes embedded pieces of information that seem to correspond with \r\nher life. For instance, this poem might well have been written \r\nabout the Kings claim on Anne Boleyn: \r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind, [Whoever longs to hunt , I know \r\nwhere there is a female deer]\r\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\n\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\n\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I, may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\n\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am, [Touch me not, for I belong \r\nto the King]\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. So perhaps after her betrothal to Henry, religious vows also \r\nentered into the picture, and left Wyatt out.\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember ...\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Hart Crane\'s Voyages is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. Because of its length, Voyages appears \r\non the following page. \r\nOther poems of Crane\'s such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower \r\nalso rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \r\nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \r\nproper and violently homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \r\nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous today for \r\nhis disdain for respectability and dull and dulling conformity, as his witty \r\nepigrams prove. But the lovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that he was \r\nalso a true poet. \r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Most Beautiful Sonnets in the English Language,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Lines in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Anglo-Saxon Riddles and Kennings;\r\nAncient Greek Epigrams and Epitaphs,\r\nThe Best Poems Ever Written, \r\nThe Best Love Poems,\r\nThe Best Erotic Poems,\r\nThe Best Love Songs Ever,\r\nThe Best Urdu Love Poetry, \r\nThe Best Poetry Translations,\r\nThe Best Poems for Kids,\r\nThe Best Nonsense Verse,\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels,\r\nThe Best American Poetry,\r\nThe Best Story Poems,\r\nThe Best Narrative Poems,\r\nThe Best Epic Poems,\r\nThe Best Thanksgiving Poems,\r\nThe Greatest Movies of All Time\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
