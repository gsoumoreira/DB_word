But it may be safe to define Modernism as largely a \r\nrelaxing of rules and a broadening of themes, style and subject matter. The French term\r\nVers \r\nLibre means liberated verse and the English variant free verse may be \r\ndefined \r\nto mean something like freer or less constrained poetry. First, the great \r\nRomantic poetsWilliam Blake, Robert Burns, Thomas \r\nChatterton, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor \r\nColeridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keatsbegan to loosen the corsets of English poetry. \r\nThen modernists like Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Thomas \r\nHardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robinson Jeffers, William Butler Yeats, Wallace Stevens, William \r\nCarlos Williams, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot,  \r\nWilfred Owen, e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, Dylan Thomas, Robert Lowell, Elizabeth \r\nBishop, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Allen Ginsberg engaged \r\nin the poetic equivalent of bra burning. On this page I will provide  \r\nexamples of various advancements and other changes introduced by Modernism.\r\n\r\ncompiled\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

Alfred Prufrock, The Wasteland and \r\nFour Quartets by T. S. Eliot who was perhaps the most influential \r\nmodernist poet\r\nLullaby by W. H. Auden and After the Persian by Louise Bogan (tie)\r\nSunday Morning and The Idea of Order at Key West by Wallace Stevens\r\nVoyages by Hart Crane, perhaps the greatest love poem in the English language\r\nDulce et Decorum Est and other anti-war poems by Wilfred Owen, \r\nperhaps the \r\ngreatest of the war poets\r\nLeaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, who upset the traditionalist applecart \r\nand got the modernist ball rolling\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention Modernist Poets and Songwriters: The Archpoet (a medieval Latin poet who was way \r\nahead of his time), Charles Baudelaire, Elizabeth Bishop, Lord \r\nByron, Thomas Chatterton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Stephen Crane, e. e. cummings, Emily \r\nDickinson, Ernest Dowson, Bob Dylan, Robert Frost, Thomas Hardy, Gerard Manley \r\nHopkins, A. E. Housman, Langston Hughes, Robinson Jeffers, John Keats, Philip Larkin, John \r\nLennon, Carole King, Louis MacNeice, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Marianne Moore, Pablo Neruda, \r\nSylvia Plath, Edgar Allan Poe, Ezra Pound, Rainer Maria Rilke, Arthur Rimbaud, Edward \r\nArlington Robinson, Smokey Robinson, Carl Sandburg, Sappho (an ancient Greek \r\npoet who has never gone out of style), Anne Sexton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Paul Simon, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, \r\nSarah Teasdale, Dylan Thomas, Paul Verlaine, Richard Wilbur, William Carlos \r\nWilliams, William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThe Garden by Ezra Pound is one of the most important poems of \r\nModernism, if only because the poet was so influential and the poem so \r\ngood that other poets were likely to pay heed and follow his lead. The \r\nGarden is a wonderful miniature of English society, capturing the essence of \r\nEngland\'s peculiar caste system in the early 20th century. The poem\'s title and \r\nthe line They shall inherit the earth suggest a Garden of Eden in \r\nwhich the fall is due to class pride and bigotry.\r\n\r\nThe Garden \r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth. \r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman was the father of Modernism, as Ezra Pound himself admitted in his poem A \r\nPact. \r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\nIf Walt Whitman was the father of American Modernism, then his contemporary \r\nEmily Dickinson was its mother. And yet two poets have never been more unalike. \r\nWhitman became famous for his gregarious bardic yawps, Dickinson for her \r\nhermetic introspections. \r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nLips unused to thee.\r\nBashful, sip thy jasmines,\r\nAs the fainting bee,\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums,\r\nCounts his nectarsalights,\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\nOne of the sea changes in poetry that began with Romanticism and continued with \r\nModernism was the expression of outrage against social and economic injustices. \r\nOne of the best poets in this regard was Langston Hughes. \r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrel Man \r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nAnd my throat\r\nIs deep with song,\r\nYou did not think\r\nI suffer after\r\nI\'ve held my pain\r\nSo long.\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nYou do not hear\r\nMy inner cry:\r\nBecause my feet\r\nAre gay with dancing,\r\nYou do not know\r\nI die.\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes suggested, not so obliquely, that if African Americans were \r\ndenied access to the American dream, they might explode into racial violence ...\r\n\r\nA Dream Deferred \r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nWhat happens to a dream deferred?\r\n\r\nDoes it dry up\r\nlike a raisin in the sun?\r\nOr fester like a sore\r\nAnd then run?\r\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\r\nOr crust and sugar over\r\nlike a syrupy sweet?\r\n\r\nMaybe it just sags\r\nlike a heavy load.\r\n\r\nOr does it explode?\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers. \r\n\r\nFeminism is another very important aspect of Modernism. In Advice to a Girl, \r\nSara Teasdale denies the Judeo-Christian dogma that women are meant to be \r\npossessed (i.e., owned and subjugated) by men. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice to a Girl by Sara Teasdale\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed;\r\nLay that on your heart,\r\nMy young angry dear;\r\nThis truth, this hard and precious stone,\r\nLay it on your hot cheek,\r\nLet it hide your tear.\r\nHold it like a crystal\r\nWhen you are alone\r\nAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.\r\nLong, look long and you will be blessed:\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Bible instructs children to always honor their parents. Sylvia Plath trumps \r\nYahweh (Jehovah) and Moses by pointing out that some fathers act like Hitler and \r\ndeserve only contempt. \r\n\r\nDaddy\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nYou do not do, you do not do\r\nAny more, black shoe\r\nIn which I have lived like a foot\r\nFor thirty years, poor and white,\r\nBarely daring to breathe or Achoo.\r\n\r\nDaddy, I have had to kill you.\r\nYou died before I had time\r\nMarble-heavy, a bag full of God,\r\nGhastly statue with one gray toe\r\nBig as a Frisco seal\r\n\r\nAnd a head in the freakish Atlantic\r\nWhere it pours bean green over blue\r\nIn the waters off the beautiful Nauset.\r\nI used to pray to recover you.\r\nAch, du.\r\n\r\nIn the German tongue, in the Polish town\r\nScraped flat by the roller\r\nOf wars, wars, wars.\r\nBut the name of the town is common.\r\nMy Polack friend\r\n\r\nSays there are a dozen or two.\r\nSo I never could tell where you\r\nPut your foot, your root, \r\nI never could talk to you.\r\nThe tongue stuck in my jaw.\r\n\r\nIt stuck in a barb wire snare.\r\nIch, ich, ich, ich,\r\nI could hardly speak.\r\nI thought every German was you.\r\nAnd the language obscene\r\n\r\nAn engine, an engine, \r\nChuffing me off like a Jew.\r\nA Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.\r\nI began to talk like a Jew.\r\nI think I may well be a Jew.\r\n\r\nThe snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna \r\nAre not very pure or true.\r\nWith my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck\r\nAnd my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack\r\nI may be a bit of a Jew.\r\n\r\nI have always been sacred of you,\r\nWith your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.\r\nAnd your neat mustache\r\nAnd your Aryan eye, bright blue.\r\nPanzer-man, panzer-man, O You\r\n\r\nNot God but a swastika\r\nSo black no sky could squeak through.\r\nEvery woman adores a Fascist,\r\nThe boot in the face, the brute\r\nBrute heart of a brute like you.\r\n\r\nYou stand at the blackboard, daddy,\r\nIn the picture I have of you,\r\nA cleft in your chin instead of your foot\r\nBut no less a devil for that, no not\r\nAny less the black man who\r\n\r\nBit my pretty red heart in two.\r\nI was ten when they buried you.\r\nAt twenty I tried to die\r\nAnd get back, back, back to you.\r\nI thought even the bones would do.\r\n\r\nBut they pulled me out of the sack,\r\nAnd they stuck me together with glue.\r\nAnd then I knew what to do.\r\nI made a model of you,\r\nA man in black with a Meinkampf look\r\n\r\nAnd a love of the rack and the screw.\r\nAnd I said I do, I do.\r\nSo daddy, I\'m finally through.\r\nThe black telephone\'s off at the root,\r\nThe voices just can\'t worm through.\r\n\r\nIf I\'ve killed one man, I\'ve killed two\r\nThe vampire who said he was you\r\nAnd drank my blood for a year,\r\nSeven years, if you want to know.\r\nDaddy, you can lie back now.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a stake in your fat black heart\r\nAnd the villagers never liked you.\r\nThey are dancing and stamping on you.\r\nThey always knew it was you.\r\nDaddy, daddy, you bastard, I\'m through.\r\n\r\nDover Beach may well be the first truly great modern English poem. While \r\nDover Beach is a romantic poem, it abandons faith in God, church and state. It \r\nalso abandons regular meter and rhyme, along with certainty. \r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nGwendolyn Brooks was the first African-American writer to receive a Pulitzer \r\nPrize. Her poems often dealt with the personal celebrations and struggles of \r\nordinary people in her community. \r\n\r\nThe Bean Eaters\r\nby Gwendolyn Brooks\r\n\r\nThey eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair.\r\nDinner is a casual affair.\r\nPlain chipware on a plain and creaking wood.\r\nTin flatware.\r\n\r\nTwo who are Mostly Good.\r\nTwo who have lived their day,\r\nBut keep putting on their clothes\r\nAnd putting things away.\r\n\r\nAnd remembering...\r\nRemembering, with twinklings and twinges\r\nAs they lean over the beans in their rented back room that is full of beads and \r\nreceipts and dolls and clothes, tobacco crumbs, vases and fringes.\r\n\r\nThe following poem by Robinson Jeffers reminds me of Robert Oppenheimer\'s \r\ncomparison of the atomic bomb to Shiva: I am become Death, the destroyer of \r\nworlds. \r\n\r\nShiva\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nThere is a hawk that is picking the birds out of our sky,\r\nShe killed the pigeons of peace and security,\r\nShe has taken honesty and confidence from nations and men,\r\nShe is hunting the lonely heron of liberty.\r\nShe loads the arts with nonsense, she is very cunning,\r\nScience with dreams and the state with powers to catch them at last.\r\nNothing will escape her at last, flying nor running.\r\nThis is the hawk that picks out the star\'s eyes.\r\nThis is the only hunter that will ever catch the wild swan;\r\nThe prey she will take last is the wild white swan of the beauty of things.\r\nThen she will be alone, pure destruction, achieved and supreme,\r\nEmpty darkness under the death-tent wings.\r\nShe will build a nest of the swan\'s bones and hatch a new brood,\r\nHang new heavens with new birds, all be renewed.\r\n\r\nEarly modernists like A. E. Housman were either atheists, agnostics, or at least \r\nvery skeptical about the claims of Christianity ...\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXLVII - For My Funeral\r\n\r\nO thou that from thy mansion\r\n  Through time and place to roam,\r\nDost send abroad thy children,\r\n  And then dost call them home,\r\n\r\nThat men and tribes and nations\r\n  And all thy hand hath made\r\nMay shelter them from sunshine\r\n  In thine eternal shade:\r\n\r\nWe now to peace and darkness\r\n  And earth and thee restore\r\nThy creature that thou madest\r\n  And wilt cast forth no more.\r\n\r\nA. E. Housman not only questioned God; he also questioned the state religion \r\nthat compels young men to fight and die for the interests of superannuated \r\nkings, lords and politicians ...\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nHere dead we lie we because we did not choose\r\n  To live and shame the land from which we sprung.\r\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\r\n  But young men think it is, and we were young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nFarewell to a name and a number\r\n  Recalled again\r\nTo darkness and silence and slumber\r\n  In blood and pain.\r\n\r\nSo ceases and turns to the thing\r\n  He was born to be\r\nA soldier cheap to the King\r\n  And dear to me;\r\n\r\nSo smothers in blood the burning\r\n  And flaming flight\r\nOf valour and truth returning\r\n  To dust and night.\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake was one of the first English poets to write fiery protest poems \r\nagainst what Dwight D. Eisenhower would later call the military-industrial \r\ncomplex. Blake employed the more poetic and imagistic term Satanic mills. \r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\n    I wander thro\' each charter\'d street,\r\n    Near where the charter\'d Thames does flow,\r\n    And mark in every face I meet\r\n    Marks of weakness, marks of woe.\r\n    In every cry of every Man,\r\n    In every Infant\'s cry of fear,\r\n    In every voice, in every ban,\r\n    The mind-forg\'d manacles I hear.\r\n    How the Chimney-sweeper\'s cry\r\n    Every blackning Church appalls,\r\n    And the hapless Soldier\'s sigh\r\n    Runs in blood down Palace walls.\r\n    But most thro\' midnight streets I hear\r\n    How the youthful Harlot\'s curse\r\n    Blasts the new-born Infant\'s tear\r\n    And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.\r\n\r\nBlake, the forbear and mentor of anti-war singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan and \r\nJohn Lennon, called for his readers to join the mental fight against the \r\nforces of darkness and injustice ...\r\n\r\nJerusalem\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\r\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\r\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\r\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\r\n\r\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\r\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\r\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\r\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\r\n\r\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\r\nBring me my arrows of desire:\r\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\r\nBring me my chariot of fire.\r\n\r\nI will not cease from mental fight,\r\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\r\nTill we have built Jerusalem\r\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\r\n\r\nA. E. Housman even dared to question the accomplishments of Christ, something \r\nfor which he would undoubtedly have been burned at the stake just a few years \r\nearlier ...\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nI - Easter Hymn\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of Romanticism and Modernism is the poet\'s increasing sense of \r\nalienation from and dissatisfaction with life. Whereas in previous generations \r\nthe mystics tended to praise God, some of the more mystical modern poets seem to \r\nfeel alienated from both God and Creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of Modernism was the refinement of poetic meter to such an extent \r\nthat it became virtually invisible, in the work of poets like Hart Crane, W. H. \r\nAuden and \r\nWallace Stevens. \r\n\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad \r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\nW. H. Auden was another poet who, in his best poems, took English poetic meter \r\nto new heights. And he did so in one of the most touching love poems ever \r\nwritten ...\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H.

If the human race ever manages to end the barbarity of war, it will be \r\nlargely because Owen created the song and his heirs (Bob Dylan, John Lennon, et \r\nal) took up the chorus. \r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n    \r\n    Editor\'s Note:  Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\n    from Horace\'s Odes and means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\n    to die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson is a vastly underrated poet whose mesmerizing Romanticism greatly \r\ninfluenced the poets of Modernism, especially T.

Alfred Prufrock is one of the best and most influential \r\npoems of early Modernism. In the poem, T. S. Eliot takes an unflinching look at \r\nhimself and the proper society he inhabits. If there is any hope of salvation, \r\nit may lie in his Romanticism, but he concludes the poem by saying that he \r\ndoesn\'t believe the mermaids will sing for him ...\r\n\r\nThe Love Song of J.

[1]\r\n\r\nLet us go then, you and I,\r\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\r\nLike a patient etherised upon a table;\r\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\r\nThe muttering retreats\r\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\r\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\r\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\r\nOf insidious intent\r\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question .\r\nOh, do not ask, What is it?\r\nLet us go and make our visit.\r\n\r\n In the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the\r\nwindow-panes,\r\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\r\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\r\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\r\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\r\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\r\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\r\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n And indeed there will be time\r\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\r\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\r\nThere will be time, there will be time\r\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\r\nThere will be time to murder and create,\r\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\r\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\r\nTime for you and time for me,\r\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\r\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\r\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\r\n\r\n In the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n And indeed there will be time\r\nTo wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?\r\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\r\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\r\n[They will say: How his hair is growing thin!]\r\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\r\n[They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!]\r\nDo I dare\r\nDisturb the universe?\r\nIn a minute there is time\r\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\n For I have known them all already, known them all:\r\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\r\n So how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the eyes already, known them all-\r\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\nThen how should I begin\r\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n And how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the arms already, known them all-\r\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]\r\nIt is perfume from a dress\r\nThat makes me so digress?\r\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n And should I then presume?\r\n And how should I begin?\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .\r\n\r\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\nSmoothed by long fingers,\r\nAsleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,\r\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\nThough I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,\r\nI am no prophetand here\'s no great matter;\r\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\nTo say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\r\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n Should say: That is not what I meant at all.\r\n That is not it, at all.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\r\nfloor\r\nAnd this, and so much more?\r\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\nWould it have been worth while\r\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\r\n That is not it at all,\r\n That is not what I meant, at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\r\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\r\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\r\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\r\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\r\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\r\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\r\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\r\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\r\n\r\nI grow old . . . I grow old . . .\r\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\r\n\r\n Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\r\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\r\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\r\n\r\n I do not think that they will sing to me.\r\n\r\n I have seen them riding seaward on the waves\r\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\r\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\r\n\r\n We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\r\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\r\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\r\n\r\n[1] Dante, Inferno 27.61-66 If I thought my answer were\r\ngiven / to anyone who would ever return to the world, / this flame would stand\r\nstill without moving any further. / But since never from this abyss / has anyone\r\never returned alive, if what I hear is true, /without fear of infamy I answer\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nPoets like John Clare introduced the grotesque to poetry; thus poems could speak \r\ntruthfully about the ugly aspects of life and question the love and wisdom \r\nof the earth\'s Creator, if such a being exists ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMouse\'s Nest \r\n\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\r\nAnd progged it as I passed and went away;\r\nAnd when I looked I fancied something stirred,\r\nAnd turned again and hoped to catch the bird \r\nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheats\r\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats;\r\nShe looked so odd and so grotesque to me,\r\nI ran and wondered what the thing could be,\r\nAnd pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood;\r\nThen the mouse hurried from the craking brood.\r\nThe young ones squeaked, and as I went away\r\nShe found her nest again among the hay.\r\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\r\nAnd broad old cesspools glittered in the sun.\r\n\r\nNow here, without further ado or comment, are some of the best poems of \r\nModernism ...\r\n\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\r\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\r\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\r\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\r\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\r\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\r\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\r\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\r\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\r\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\r\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\r\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\r\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\r\n\r\nsomewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nsomewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond\r\nany experience,your eyes have their silence:\r\nin your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,\r\nor which i cannot touch because they are too near\r\nyour slightest look will easily unclose me\r\nthough i have closed myself as fingers,\r\nyou open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens\r\n(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose\r\nor if your wish be to close me, i and\r\nmy life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly,\r\nas when the heart of this flower imagines\r\nthe snow carefully everywhere descending;\r\nnothing which we are to perceive in this world equals\r\nthe power of your intense fragility:whose texture\r\ncompels me with the color of its countries,\r\nrendering death and forever with each breathing\r\n(i do not know what it is about you that closes\r\nand opens;only something in me understands\r\nthe voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)\r\nnobody,not even the rain,has such small hands\r\n\r\nA charm invests a face\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nA charm invests a face\r\nImperfectly beheld.\r\nThe lady dare not lift her veil\r\nFor fear it be dispelled.\r\n\r\nBut peers beyond her mesh,\r\nAnd wishes, and denies,\r\nLest interview annul a want\r\nThat image satisfies.\r\n\r\nI gave myself to him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nI gave myself to him,\r\nAnd took himself for pay.\r\nThe solemn contract of a life\r\nWas ratified this way\r\n\r\nThe value might disappoint,\r\nMyself a poorer prove\r\nThan this my purchaser suspect,\r\nThe daily own of Love\r\n\r\nDepreciates the sight;\r\nBut, \'til the merchant buy,\r\nStill fabled, in the isles of spice\r\nThe subtle cargoes lie.\r\n\r\nAt least, \'tis mutual risk,\r\nSome found it mutual gain;\r\nSweet debt of Life, each night to owe,\r\nInsolvent, every noon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nTo what purpose, April, do you return again?\r\nBeauty is not enough.\r\nYou can no longer quiet me with the redness\r\nOf little leaves opening stickily.\r\nI know what I know.\r\nThe sun is hot on my neck as I observe\r\nThe spikes of the crocus.\r\nThe smell of the earth is good.\r\nIt is apparent that there is no death.\r\nBut what does that signify?\r\nNot only under ground are the brains of men \r\n\r\nEaten by maggots.\r\nLife in itself\r\nIs nothing,\r\nAn empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.\r\nIt is not enough that yearly, down this hill,\r\nApril\r\nComes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. \r\n\r\nTulips\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.\r\nLook how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.\r\nI am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly\r\nAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.\r\nI am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.\r\nI have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses\r\nAnd my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.\r\n\r\nThey have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff\r\nLike an eye between two white lids that will not shut.\r\nStupid pupil, it has to take everything in.\r\nThe nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,\r\nThey pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,\r\nDoing things with their hands, one just the same as another,\r\nSo it is impossible to tell how many there are.\r\n\r\nMy body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water\r\nTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.\r\nThey bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep\r\nNow I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\r\nMy patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,\r\nMy husband and child smiling out of the family photo;\r\nTheir smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.\r\nI have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat\r\nStubbornly hanging on to my name and address.\r\nThey have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.\r\nScared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley\r\nI watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books\r\nSink out of sight, and the water went over my head.\r\nI am a nun now, I have never been so pure.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t want any flowers, I only wanted\r\nTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.\r\nHow free it is, you have no idea how free -\r\nThe peacefulness is so big it dazes you,\r\nAnd it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.\r\nIt is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them\r\nShutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.\r\nEven through the gift paper I could hear them breathe\r\nLightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.\r\nTheir redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.\r\nThey are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down\r\nUpsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,\r\nA dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.\r\n\r\nNobody watched me before, now I am watched.\r\nThe tulips turn to me, and the window behind me\r\nWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,\r\nAnd I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow\r\nBetween the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,\r\nAnd I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself\r\nThe vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\r\n\r\nBefore they came the air was calm enough,\r\nComing and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.\r\nThen the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.\r\nNow the air snags and eddies round them the way a river\r\nSnags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.\r\nThey concentrate my attention, that was happy\r\nPlaying and resting without committing itself.\r\n\r\nThe walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.\r\nThe tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;\r\nThey are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,\r\nAnd I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes\r\nIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.\r\nThe water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,\r\nAnd comes from a country far away as health.\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nBy Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nThis Living Hand\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\r\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\r\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\r\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\r\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\r\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\r\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\r\nI hold it towards you.\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D.

Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\nIn Memory of W. B. Yeats\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in the dead of winter:\r\nThe brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,\r\nAnd snow disfigured the public statues;\r\nThe mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nFar from his illness\r\nThe wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,\r\nThe peasant river was untempted by the fashionable \r\nquays;\r\nBy mourning tongues\r\nThe death of the poet was kept from his poems.\r\n\r\nBut for him it was his last afternoon as himself,\r\nAn afternoon of nurses and rumours;\r\nThe provinces of his body revolted,\r\nThe squares of his mind were empty,\r\nSilence invaded the suburbs,\r\nThe current of his feeling failed; he became his \r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nNow he is scattered among a hundred cities\r\nAnd wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,\r\nTo find his happiness in another kind of wood\r\nAnd be punished under a foreign code of conscience.\r\nThe words of a dead man\r\nAre modified in the guts of the living.\r\n\r\nBut in the importance and noise of to-morrow\r\nWhen the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of \r\nthe Bourse,\r\nAnd the poor have the sufferings to which they are \r\nfairly accustomed,\r\nAnd each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of \r\nhis freedom,\r\nA few thousand will think of this day\r\nAs one thinks of a day when one did something slightly \r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nYou were silly like us; your gift survived it all:\r\nThe parish of rich women, physical decay,\r\nYourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.\r\nNow Ireland has her madness and her weather still,\r\nFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives\r\nIn the valley of its making where executives\r\nWould never want to tamper, flows on south\r\nFrom ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,\r\nRaw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,\r\nA way of happening, a mouth.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEarth, receive an honoured guest:\r\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest.\r\nLet the Irish vessel lie\r\nEmptied of its poetry.\r\n\r\nIn the nightmare of the dark\r\nAll the dogs of Europe bark,\r\nAnd the living nations wait,\r\nEach sequestered in its hate;\r\n\r\nIntellectual disgrace\r\nStares from every human face,\r\nAnd the seas of pity lie\r\nLocked and frozen in each eye.\r\n\r\nFollow, poet, follow right\r\nTo the bottom of the night,\r\nWith your unconstraining voice\r\nStill persuade us to rejoice;\r\n\r\nWith the farming of a verse\r\nMake a vineyard of the curse,\r\nSing of human unsuccess\r\nIn a rapture of distress;\r\n\r\nIn the deserts of the heart\r\nLet the healing fountain start,\r\nIn the prison of his days\r\nTeach the free man how to praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\n\r\nby\r\nThomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge by Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God. \r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirective by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\r\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\r\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\r\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\r\nThere is a house that is no more a house\r\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\r\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\r\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\r\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\r\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry \r\nGreat monolithic knees the former town\r\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\r\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\r\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\r\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\r\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\r\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\r\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\r\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\r\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\r\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\r\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\r\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\r\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\r\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\r\nThey think too much of having shaded out\r\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\r\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\r\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\r\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\r\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\r\nThe height of the adventure is the height\r\nOf country where two village cultures faded\r\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI Knew A Woman \r\n\r\nby Theodore Roethke\r\n\r\nI knew a woman, lovely in her bones,\r\nWhen small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;\r\nAh, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:\r\nThe shapes a bright container can contain!\r\nOf her choice virtues only gods should speak,\r\nOr English poets who grew up on Greek\r\n(I\'d have them sing in chorus, cheek to cheek.)\r\n\r\nHow well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,\r\nShe taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and stand;\r\nShe taught me Touch, that undulant white skin:\r\nI nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;\r\nShe was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,\r\nComing behind her for her pretty sake\r\n(But what prodigious mowing did we make.)\r\n\r\nLove likes a gander, and adores a goose:\r\nHer full lips pursed, the errant note to seize;\r\nShe played it quick, she played it light and loose;\r\nMy eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;\r\nHer several parts could keep a pure repose,\r\nOr one hip quiver with a mobile nose\r\n(She moved in circles, and those circles moved.)\r\n\r\nLet seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:\r\nI\'m martyr to a motion not my own;\r\nWhat\'s freedom for? To know eternity.\r\nI swear she cast a shadow white as stone.\r\nBut who would count eternity in days?\r\nThese old bones live to learn her wanton ways:\r\n(I measure time by how a body sways.)\r\n\r\nThe Broken Tower\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\r\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\r\nOf a spent day  to wander the cathedral lawn\r\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\r\n\r\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\r\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\r\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\r\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\r\n\r\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\r\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping \r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hope  cleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)  or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)  but slip\r\nOf pebbles,  visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaming of Parts \r\nby Henry Reed\r\n\r\nVixi duellis nuper idoneus\r\nEt militavi non sine glori\r\n\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling \r\nswivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let \r\nme\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\r\n They call it easing the Spring.\r\n\r\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\r\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of \r\nbalance,\r\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the \r\nalmond-blossom\r\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going \r\nbackwards and forwards,\r\n For today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Windhover by Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nTime, Real And Imaginary\r\n \r\n\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the wide level of a mountain\'s head,\r\n    (I knew not where, but \'twas some faery place)\r\n    Their pinions, ostrich-like, for sails out-spread,\r\n    Two lovely children run an endless race,\r\n     A sister and a brother!\r\n     This far outstripp\'d the other;\r\n    Yet ever runs she with reverted face,\r\n    And looks and listens for the boy behind:\r\n     For he, alas! is blind!\r\n    O\'er rough and smooth with even step he passed,\r\n    And knows not whether he be first or last.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fitful Alternations Of The Rain \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nThe fitful alternations of the rain,\r\nWhen the chill wind, languid as with pain\r\nOf its own heavy moisture, here and there\r\nDrives through the gray and beamless atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose \r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n      \r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n      \r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n      \r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden Of Love \r\n  by William Blake\r\n  \r\n    I laid me down upon a bank,\r\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\r\nI heard among the rushes dank\r\nWeeping, weeping.\r\n    \r\nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\r\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\r\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\r\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\r\n    \r\nI went to the Garden of Love,\r\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\r\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\r\nWhere I used to play on the green.\r\n    \r\nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\r\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\r\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\r\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\r\n    \r\nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\r\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\r\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\r\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Is Too Much With Us by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\r\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\r\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\r\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\r\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\r\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\r\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\r\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\r\nIt moves us not.Great God! I\'d rather be\r\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\r\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\r\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\r\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\r\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreath\xe8d horn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solitary by Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nMy heart has grown rich with the passing of years,\r\n I have less need now than when I was young \r\nTo share myself with every comer\r\n Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.\r\nIt is one to me that they come or go\r\n If I have myself and the drive of my will,\r\nAnd strength to climb on a summer night\r\n And watch the stars swarm over the hill.\r\nLet them think I love them more than I do,\r\n Let them think I care, though I go alone;\r\nIf it lifts their pride, what is it to me\r\n Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom. \r\n\r\nCargoes\r\nby \r\nJohn Masefield \r\n\r\n\r\nQuinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir,\r\nRowing home to haven in sunny Palestine,\r\nWith a cargo of ivory,\r\nAnd apes and peacocks,\r\nSandalwood, cedarwood, and sweet white wine.\r\n\r\nStately Spanish galleon coming from the Isthmus, \r\n\r\nDipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of diamonds,\r\nEmeralds, amethysts,\r\nTopazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores.\r\n\r\nDirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack, \r\n\r\nButting through the Channel in the mad March days, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of Tyne coal,\r\nRoad-rails, pig-lead,\r\nFirewood, iron-ware, and cheap tin trays.\r\n\r\nA quinquireme is ancient galley with five banks of oars on \r\neach side.

Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel.  None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch.  And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.  It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fish \r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nI caught a tremendous fish\r\nand held him beside the boat\r\nhalf out of water, with my hook\r\nfast in a corner of his mouth.\r\nHe didn\'t fight.\r\nHe hadn\'t fought at all.\r\nHe hung a grunting weight,\r\nbattered and venerable\r\nand homely.  Here and there\r\nhis brown skin hung in strips\r\nlike ancient wallpaper,\r\nand its pattern of darker brown\r\nwas like wallpaper:\r\nshapes like full-blown roses\r\nstained and lost through age.\r\nHe was speckled with barnacles,\r\nfine rosettes of lime,\r\nand infested\r\nwith tiny white sea-lice,\r\nand underneath two or three\r\nrags of green weed hung down.\r\nWhile his gills were breathing in\r\nthe terrible oxygen\r\nthe frightening gills,\r\nfresh and crisp with blood,\r\nthat can cut so badly\r\nI thought of the coarse white flesh\r\npacked in like feathers,\r\nthe big bones and the little bones,\r\nthe dramatic reds and blacks\r\nof his shiny entrails,\r\nand the pink swim-bladder\r\nlike a big peony.\r\nI looked into his eyes\r\nwhich were far larger than mine\r\nbut shallower, and yellowed,\r\nthe irises backed and packed\r\nwith tarnished tinfoil\r\nseen through the lenses\r\nof old scratched isinglass.\r\nThey shifted a little, but not\r\nto return my stare.\r\nIt was more like the tipping\r\nof an object toward the light.\r\nI admired his sullen face,\r\nthe mechanism of his jaw,\r\nand then I saw\r\nthat from his lower lip\r\nif you could call it a lip \r\ngrim, wet, and weaponlike,\r\nhung five old pieces of fish-line,\r\nor four and a wire leader\r\nwith the swivel still attached,\r\nwith all their five big hooks\r\ngrown firmly in his mouth.\r\nA green line, frayed at the end\r\nwhere he broke it, two heavier lines, \r\nand a fine black thread\r\nstill crimped from the strain and snap\r\nwhen it broke and he got away.\r\nLike medals with their ribbons\r\nfrayed and wavering,\r\na five-haired beard of wisdom\r\ntrailing from his aching jaw.\r\nI stared and stared\r\nand victory filled up\r\nthe little rented boat,\r\nfrom the pool of bilge\r\nwhere oil had spread a rainbow\r\naround the rusted engine\r\nto the bailer rusted orange,\r\nthe sun-cracked thwarts,\r\nthe oarlocks on their strings,\r\nthe gunnelsuntil everything\r\nwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!\r\nAnd I let the fish go.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop\r\nfor Robert Lowell\r\n\r\n      This is the time of year\r\n      when almost every night\r\n      the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.\r\n      Climbing the mountain height,\r\n      \r\n      rising toward a saint\r\n      still honored in these parts,\r\n      the paper chambers flush and fill with light\r\n      that comes and goes, like hearts.\r\n      \r\n      Once up against the sky it\'s hard\r\n      to tell them from the stars \r\n      planets, that is  the tinted ones:\r\n      Venus going down, or Mars,\r\n      \r\n      or the pale green one. With a wind,\r\n      they flare and falter, wobble and toss;\r\n      but if it\'s still they steer between\r\n      the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,\r\n      \r\n      receding, dwindling, solemnly\r\n      and steadily forsaking us,\r\n      or, in the downdraft from a peak,\r\n      suddenly turning dangerous.\r\n      \r\n      Last night another big one fell.\r\n      It splattered like an egg of fire\r\n      against the cliff behind the house.\r\n      The flame ran down. We saw the pair\r\n      \r\n      of owls who nest there flying up\r\n      and up, their whirling black-and-white\r\n      stained bright pink underneath, until\r\n      they shrieked up out of sight.\r\n      \r\n      The ancient owls\' nest must have burned.\r\n      Hastily, all alone,\r\n      a glistening armadillo left the scene,\r\n      rose-flecked, head down, tail down,\r\n      \r\n      and then a baby rabbit jumped out,\r\n      short-eared, to our surprise.\r\n      So soft!  a handful of intangible ash\r\n      with fixed, ignited eyes.\r\n      \r\n      Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!\r\n      O falling fire and piercing cry\r\n      and panic, and a weak mailed fist\r\n      clenched ignorant against the sky!\r\n\r\n\r\nin Just- by E.

I do not think I would.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressed by Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind, \r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find \r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest \r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast: \r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed, \r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, \r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason \r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain, \r\nI shall remember you with love, or season \r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain: \r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason \r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\r\nI only know that summer sang in me\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more.\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T.

Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nBagpipe Music \r\nby Louis MacNeice\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\r\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the \r\npeepshow.\r\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes \r\nare made of python,\r\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls \r\nwith head of bison.\r\n\r\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\r\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\r\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\r\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\r\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a \r\ntaxi.\r\n\r\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the \r\nheather,\r\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\r\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\r\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the \r\npuncture.\r\n\r\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was \r\nsober,\r\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one \r\nfoot over.\r\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with \r\nrepulsion,\r\nSaid to the midwife Take it away; I\'m through with \r\noverproduction.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the gossip column, it\'s no go the Ceilidh,\r\nAll we want is a mother\'s help and a sugar-stick for the \r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nWillie Murray cut his thumb, couldn\'t count the damage,\r\nTook the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a \r\nbandage.\r\nHis brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,\r\nThrew the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the \r\nparish.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Herring Board, it\'s no go the Bible,\r\nAll we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the picture palace, it\'s no go the stadium,\r\nIt\'s no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,\r\nIt\'s no go the Government grants, it\'s no go the \r\nelections,\r\nSit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a \r\npension.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go my honey love, it\'s no go my poppet;\r\nWork your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the \r\nprofit.\r\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall \r\nforever,\r\nBut if you break the bloody glass you won\'t hold up the \r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament \r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby E.

Whole families \r\nshopping at night! Aisles\r\nfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the \r\ntomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the \r\nwatermelons?\r\n I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old \r\ngrubber, poking among the\r\nmeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\n I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the \r\npork chops? What price\r\nbananas? Are you my Angel?\r\n I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of \r\ncans following you, and\r\nfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\n We strode down the open corridors together in our \r\nsolitary fancy tasting\r\nartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never \r\npassing the cashier.\r\n Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in \r\nan hour. Which way does\r\nyour beard point tonight?\r\n (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the \r\nsupermarket and feel\r\nabsurd.)\r\n Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The \r\ntrees add shade to\r\nshade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\n Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love \r\npast blue automobiles in\r\ndriveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\n Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old \r\ncourage-teacher, what America did you\r\nhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out \r\non a smoking bank and\r\nstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of \r\nLethe?\r\n\r\nThe Health-Food Diner \r\nby Maya Angelou\r\n\r\nNo sprouted wheat and soya shoots\r\nAnd Brussels in a cake,\r\nCarrot straw and spinach raw,\r\n(Today, I need a steak).\r\n\r\nNot thick brown rice and rice pilaw\r\nOr mushrooms creamed on toast,\r\nTurnips mashed and parsnips hashed,\r\n(I\'m dreaming of a roast).\r\n\r\nHealth-food folks around the world\r\nAre thinned by anxious zeal,\r\nThey look for help in seafood kelp\r\n(I count on breaded veal).\r\n\r\nNo smoking signs, raw mustard greens,\r\nZucchini by the ton,\r\nUncooked kale and bodies frail\r\nAre sure to make me run\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nLoins of pork and chicken thighs\r\nAnd standing rib, so prime,\r\nPork chops brown and fresh ground round\r\n(I crave them all the time).\r\n\r\nIrish stews and boiled corned beef\r\nand hot dogs by the scores,\r\nor any place that saves a space\r\nFor smoking carnivores.\r\n\r\nHelen \r\nby H.

I had not slept for knowing\r\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\r\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the winds flowing\r\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\r\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\r\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\r\nListening.\r\n\r\nReflects that these enjoy\r\nTheir countrys gratitude, that deep repose,\r\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\r\nThat rest, that sleep\r\n\r\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\r\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\r\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\r\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\r\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\r\nI felt him waiting.\r\n\r\nIndicates the flag\r\nWhich (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain\r\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\r\nHave made America\r\n\r\nIn the ripe grain\r\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\r\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\r\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\r\nWaitinglistening\r\n\r\nDedicates to them\r\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\r\nA Grateful country\r\n\r\nUnder the dry grass stem\r\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\r\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\r\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\r\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\r\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\r\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\r\n\r\nThe living scatter, they run into houses, the wind\r\nIs trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again\r\nTrampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned\r\nSpurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,\r\nSeeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping\r\nBetween cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:\r\nThe earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,\r\nHe rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.\r\n\r\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\r\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\r\n\r\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\'s shade,\r\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,\r\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\r\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\r\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\r\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\r\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\r\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\r\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share,\r\n\r\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\r\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\r\nHow bow\'d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\r\n\r\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\r\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\r\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\r\nThe short and simple annals of the Poor.\r\n\r\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\r\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\r\nAwaits alike th\' inevitable hour:\r\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\r\n\r\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault\r\nIf Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise,\r\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\r\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\r\n\r\nCan storied urn or animated bust\r\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\nCan Honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\nOr Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\r\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\r\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\'d,\r\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\r\n\r\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\r\nRich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\r\nChill Penury repress\'d their noble rage,\r\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\r\n\r\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene\r\nThe dark unfathom\'d caves of ocean bear:\r\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\r\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,\r\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\r\nSome Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\r\n\r\nTh\' applause of list\'ning senates to command,\r\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\r\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\r\nAnd read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\r\n\r\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone\r\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\r\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\r\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\r\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\r\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\r\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\r\n\r\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\r\nTheir sober wishes never learn\'d to stray;\r\nAlong the cool sequester\'d vale of life\r\nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.\r\n\r\nYet e\'en these bones from insult to protect\r\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\r\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck\'d,\r\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\r\n\r\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th\' unletter\'d Muse,\r\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\r\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\r\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\r\n\r\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\r\nThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resign\'d,\r\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\r\nNor cast one longing lingering look behind?\r\n\r\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\r\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\r\nE\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\r\n\r\nFor thee, who, mindful of th\' unhonour\'d dead,\r\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\r\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\r\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\r\n\r\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\r\nOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\r\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,\r\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn;\r\n\r\n\'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\r\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.\r\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\r\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\r\n\r\n\'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\r\nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;\r\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\r\nOr crazed with care, or cross\'d in hopeless love.\r\n\r\n\'One morn I miss\'d him on the custom\'d hill,\r\nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;\r\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\r\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\r\n\r\n\'The next with dirges due in sad array\r\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\r\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\r\nGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\'\r\n\r\nThe Epitaph\r\n\r\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\r\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\r\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\r\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own.\r\n\r\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\r\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\r\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\r\nHe gained from Heaven (\'twas all he wish\'d) a friend.\r\n\r\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\r\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode\r\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\r\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\r\n\r\nChurch Going\r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nOnce I am sure there\'s nothing going on\r\nI step inside, letting the door thud shut.\r\nAnother church: matting, seats, and stone,\r\nAnd little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut\r\nFor Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff\r\nUp at the holy end; the small neat organ;\r\nAnd a tense, musty, unignorable silence,\r\nBrewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off\r\nMy cycle-clips in awkward reverence,\r\n\r\nMove forward, run my hand around the font.\r\nFrom where I stand, the roof looks almost new\r\nCleaned or restored? Someone would know: I don\'t.\r\nMounting the lectern, I peruse a few\r\nHectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce\r\nHere endeth much more loudly than I\'d meant.\r\nThe echoes snigger briefly. Back at the door\r\nI sign the book, donate an Irish sixpence,\r\nReflect the place was not worth stopping for.\r\n\r\nYet stop I did: in fact I often do,\r\nAnd always end much at a loss like this,\r\nWondering what to look for; wondering, too,\r\nWhen churches fall completely out of use\r\nWhat we shall turn them into, if we shall keep\r\nA few cathedrals chronically on show,\r\nTheir parchment, plate, and pyx in locked cases,\r\nAnd let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.\r\nShall we avoid them as unlucky places?\r\n\r\nOr, after dark, will dubious women come\r\nTo make their children touch a particular stone;\r\nPick simples for a cancer; or on some\r\nAdvised night see walking a dead one?\r\nPower of some sort or other will go on\r\nIn games, in riddles, seemingly at random;\r\nBut superstition, like belief, must die,\r\nAnd what remains when disbelief has gone?\r\nGrass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,\r\n\r\nA shape less recognizable each week,\r\nA purpose more obscure. I wonder who\r\nWill be the last, the very last, to seek\r\nThis place for what it was; one of the crew\r\nThat tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were?\r\nSome ruin-bibber, randy for antique,\r\nOr Christmas-addict, counting on a whiff\r\nOf gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh?\r\nOr will he be my representative,\r\n\r\nBored, uninformed, knowing the ghostly silt\r\nDispersed, yet tending to this cross of ground\r\nThrough suburb scrub because it held unspilt\r\nSo long and equably what since is found\r\nOnly in separation  marriage, and birth,\r\nAnd death, and thoughts of these  for whom was built\r\nThis special shell? For, though I\'ve no idea\r\nWhat this accoutred frowsty barn is worth,\r\nIt pleases me to stand in silence here;\r\n\r\nA serious house on serious earth it is,\r\nIn whose blent air all our compulsions meet,\r\nAre recognised, and robed as destinies.\r\nAnd that much never can be obsolete,\r\nSince someone will forever be surprising\r\nA hunger in himself to be more serious,\r\nAnd gravitating with it to this ground,\r\nWhich, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,\r\nIf only that so many dead lie round.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
