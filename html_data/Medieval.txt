To critics who object to variations from the original \r\ntexts, my response is that there are often substantial disagreements among even \r\nthe most accomplished translators. Variations begin with the \r\nreadings because different people receive different things from \r\ndifferent poems. And a strict word-for-word translation will seldom, if ever, \r\nresult in poetry. In my opinion translation is much closer to an art than a \r\nperfect science and I side with Rabindranath Tagore, who said he needed some \r\nleeway in order to produce poetry in another language when he translated his \r\nHindi \r\npoems into English.MRB\r\n\r\nHow Long the Night (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa early \r\n13th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant, indeed, while the summer lasts\r\nwith the mild pheasants\' song ...\r\nbut now I feel the northern wind\'s blast\r\nits severe weather strong.\r\nAlas! Alas! This night seems so long!\r\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\r\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\r\n\r\nThree Roundels by Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nI. Merciles Beaute \r\n(Merciless Beauty)\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen. \r\nUnless your words heal me hastily,\r\nmy heart\'s wound will remain green;\r\nfor your eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain. \r\nBy all truth, I tell you faithfully\r\nthat you are of life and death my queen;\r\nfor at my death this truth shall be seen:\r\nyour eyes slay me suddenly;\r\ntheir beauty I cannot sustain,\r\nthey wound me so, through my heart keen.\r\nOriginal text: \r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly,\r\nI may the beaute of hem not sustene,\r\nSo woundeth hit through-out my herte kene. \r\nAnd but your word wol helen hastily\r\nMy hertes wounde, whyl that hit is grene,\r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly; \r\nmay the beaute of hem not sustene. \r\nUpon my trouthe I sey yow feithfully,\r\nThat ye ben of my lyf and deth the quene;\r\nFor with my deth the trouthe shal be sene.\r\nYour y\xebn two wol sle me sodenly,\r\nI may the beaute of hem not sustene,\r\nSo woundeth hit through-out my herte kene. \r\n\r\nII. Rejection\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain.\r\nI\'m guiltless, yet my sentence has been cast.\r\nI tell you truly, needless now to feign,\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain.\r\nAlas, that Nature in your face compassed\r\nSuch beauty, that no man may hope attain\r\nTo mercy, though he perish from the pain;\r\nYour beauty from your heart has so erased\r\nPity, that its useless to complain;\r\nFor Pride now holds your mercy by a chain. \r\nOriginal text:\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herte chaced\r\nPitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;\r\nFor Daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.\r\nGiltles my deth thus han ye me purchaced;\r\nI sey yow soth, me nedeth not to feyne;\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herle chaced\r\nPilee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne\r\nAllas! that nature hath in yow compassed\r\nSo gret beaute, that no man may atteyne\r\nTo mercy, though he sterve for the peyne.\r\nSo hath your beaute fro your herte chaced\r\nPitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;\r\nFor daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne. \r\n\r\nIII. Escape\r\nby Geoffrey Chaucer\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean.\r\nHe may question me and counter this and that;\r\nI care not: I will answer just as I mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean. \r\nLove strikes me from his roster, short and flat,\r\nAnd he is struck from my books, just as clean,\r\nForevermore; there is no other mean.\r\nSince Im escaped from Love and yet still fat,\r\nI never plan to be in his prison lean;\r\nSince I am free, I count it not a bean. \r\n\r\nOriginal text:\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene;\r\nSin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.\r\nHe may answere, and seye this or that;\r\nI do no fors, I speke right as I mene.\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene.\r\nLove hath my name y-strike out of his sclat,\r\nAnd he is strike out of my bokes clene\r\nFor ever-mo; [ther] is non other mene.\r\nSin I fro love escaped am so fat,\r\nI never thenk to ben in his prison lene;\r\nSin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.\r\nExplicit.\r\n\r\nRondel: Your Smiling Mouth\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains,\r\nYour hands so smooth, each finger straight and plain, \r\nYour little feetplease, what more can I say?\r\n\r\nIt is my fetish when youre far away\r\nTo muse on these and thus to soothe my pain\r\nYour smiling mouth and laughing eyes, bright gray, \r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains.\r\n\r\nSo would I beg you, if I only may, \r\nTo see such sights as I before have seen, \r\nBecause my fetish pleases me. Obscene?\r\nIll be obsessed until my dying day\r\nBy your sweet smiling mouth and eyes, bright gray,\r\nYour ample breasts and slender arms twin chains!\r\nSpring\r\nby Charles dOrleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\nYoung lovers, \r\ngreeting the spring\r\nfling themselves downhill,\r\nmaking cobblestones ring\r\nwith their wild leaps and arcs,\r\nlike ecstatic sparks \r\nstruck from coal. \r\nWhat is their brazen goal?\r\n\r\nThey grab at whatever passes,\r\nso we can only hazard guesses.\r\nBut they rear like prancing steeds\r\nraked by brilliant spurs of need,\r\nYoung lovers. \r\nThe original French poem:\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx\r\nEn la nouvelle saison,\r\nPar les rues, sans raison,\r\nChevauchent, faisans les saulx.\r\nEt font saillir des carreaulx\r\nLe feu, comme de cherbon,\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx.\r\nJe ne s\xe7ay se leurs travaulx\r\nIlz emploient bien ou non,\r\nMais piqu\xe9s de lesperon\r\nSont autant que leurs chevaulx\r\nJeunes amoureux nouveaulx.\r\n\r\nOft in My Thought\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\r\n Around the advent of the fledgling year,\r\nFor something pretty that I really ought\r\n To give my lady dear;\r\n But that sweet thought\'s been wrested from me, clear,\r\n Since death, alas, has sealed her under clay\r\n And robbed the world of all that\'s precious here\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\r\n Acceptable, as suits my age\'s hour?\r\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\r\n Her worth? It tests my power!\r\n I serve her now with masses and with prayer;\r\n For it would be \r\na shame for me to stray\r\n Far from my faith, when my time\'s drawing near\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\r\n And the cost of everything became \r\nso dear;\r\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\r\n Take my good deeds, as many as there are,\r\n And crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\r\n As heaven\'s truest maid! And may I \r\nsay:\r\n Most good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\n\r\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\r\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\r\n Then my heart floods like an overflowing bay\r\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier\r\n God keep her soul, I can no better say.\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nby Charles d\'Orleans (c. 1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away\r\nof wind and cold and chilling rain\r\nto dress in embroidered light again:\r\nthe light of daybright, festive, gay!\r\nEach bird and beast, without delay,\r\nin its own tongue, sings this refrain:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away!\r\nBrooks, fountains, rivers, streams at play,\r\nwear, with their summer livery,\r\nbright beads of silver jewelry.\r\nAll the Earth has a new and fresh display:\r\nWinter has cast his cloak away! \r\nNote: This rondeau was set to music by Debussy in his Trois chansons de \r\nFrance. \r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nby Charles dOrleans (1394-1465)\r\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold\r\nof wind, chill rain and bitter air,\r\nand now goes clad in clothes of gold\r\nof smiling suns and seasons fair,\r\nwhile birds and beasts of wood and fold\r\nnow with each cry and song declare:\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold!\r\nAll brooks, springs, rivers, seaward rolled,\r\nnow pleasant summer livery wear\r\nwith silver beads embroidered where\r\nthe world puts off its raiment old.\r\nThe year lays down his mantle cold.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (Old English circa 960-990 AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy people pursue him like crippled prey.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different!\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere, bloodthirsty curs roam this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different!\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained, as I wept,\r\nthe bold warrior came; he took me in his arms:\r\ngood feelings for him, but their end loathsome!\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat!\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? Watchdog! \r\nA wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nWhat an earthy, dirty, brutally honest poem written from a female perspective about \r\nwhat sounds like war, a family being split apart, and perhaps rape, sex slavery \r\nand child abduction and/or infanticide. Much remains in doubt: did Wulf abduct \r\nthe child, perhaps thinking the child was his, or did the the mother, the rapist or perhaps the rapist\'s \r\nwife get rid of the child? In my opinion the original poem is one of the truly \r\ngreat poems in the English language, so my translation seems like a worthwhile \r\nendeavor, especially if other people like what I\'ve done.\r\n\r\nThere was another \r\npoem that also vexed me because I didn\'t really care for the translations of it \r\nthat I had read, and it was perhaps the first poem to be written in the \r\nthen-fledgling English language:\r\n\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn (Old English circa 658-680 AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nCome, let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the Everlasting Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the Primeval Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, Holy Creator,\r\nMaker of mankind. Then he, the Eternal Entity,\r\nafterwards made men middle-earth: Master Almighty!\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD and may \r\nbe the oldest extant poem in the English language. According to the \r\nVenerable Bede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who was given the \r\ngift of poetic composition by an angel. In the original poem, hardly a word is \r\nrecognizable as English because C\xe6dmon was writing in a somewhat Anglicized form of \r\nancient German. The word England harkens back to Angle-land; the Angles were a \r\nGermanic tribe. Nevertheless, by C\xe6dmon\'s time the foundations of English poetry \r\nwere being laid, particularly in the areas of accentual meter and alliteration. \r\nPoets were considered to be Makers (as in William Dunbar\'s Lament for the \r\nMakaris), and poetry was considered to have a divine origin, so the poem may \r\nexpress a sort of affinity between the poet and his Creator.\r\n\r\nNow here are four \r\nsplendid but little-known poems from the early 13th century that may predate Chaucer. Please \r\nnote the introduction of end rhyme ...\r\n\r\nWestron Wynde (anonymous Middle English lyric, found in a partbook circa 1530 AD, \r\nbut perhaps written much earlier)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWestern wind, when will you blow,\r\nbringing the drizzling rain?\r\nChrist, that my love were in my arms,\r\nand I in my bed again!\r\n\r\nNOTE: The original poem has the smalle rayne down can rayne which suggests a \r\ndrizzle or mist, either of which would suggest a dismal day. \r\n\r\nThis World\'s Joy  (anonymous \r\nMiddle English lyric, circa early \r\n14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWinter awakens all my care\r\nas leafless trees grow bare.\r\nFor now my sighs are fraught\r\nwhenever it enters my thought:\r\nregarding this world\'s joy,\r\nhow everything comes to naught.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. 2253. f. 49r]\r\n\r\nWynter wakeneth al my care,\r\nNou this leves waxeth bare.\r\nOfte y sike ant mourne sare\r\nWhen hit cometh in my thoht\r\nOf this worldes joie, hou hit goth al to noht.\r\n\r\nPity Mary (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa early 13th \r\ncentury AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow the sun passes under the wood:\r\nI rue, Mary, thy facefair, good.\r\nNow the sun passes under the tree:\r\nI rue, Mary, thy son and thee.\r\n\r\nIn the poem above, note how wood and tree invoke the cross while sun and \r\nson seem to invoke each other. Sun-day is also Son-day, to Christians.The \r\nanonymous poet who wrote the poem above may have been been punning the \r\nwords sun and son. The poem is also known as Now Goeth \r\nSun Under Wood and Now Go\'th Sun Under Wood. Here\'s another poem from the same \r\nera:\r\n\r\nFowles in the Frith (anonymous Middle English lyric, circa \r\n13th-14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe fowls in the forest,\r\nthe fishes in the flood\r\nand I must go mad:\r\nsuch sorrow I\'ve had\r\nfor beasts of bone and blood!\r\n\r\nSounds like an early animal rights activist! The use of and is intriguing ... \r\nis the poet saying that his walks in the wood drive him mad because he is also a \r\nbeast of bone and blood, facing a similar fate?\r\n\r\nI am of Ireland (anonymous Medieval Irish lyric, circa \r\n13th-14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI am of Ireland,\r\nand of the holy realm of Ireland.\r\nGentlefolk, I pray thee:\r\nfor the sake of saintly charity,\r\ncome dance with me\r\nin Ireland!\r\n\r\nIch am of Irlaunde,\r\nAnt of the holy londe\r\nOf Irlande.\r\nGode sire, pray ich the,\r\nFor of saynte charit\xe9,\r\nCome ant daunce wyth me\r\nIn Irlaunde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poem above still smacks of German, with Ich for I. But a metamorphosis was \r\nclearly in progress: English poetry was evolving to employ meter and rhyme, as \r\nwell as Anglo-Saxon alliteration. And it\'s interesting to note that ballad, \r\nballet and ball all have the same root: the Latin ballare (to \r\ndance) and the Italian ballo/balleto (a dance). Think of a farm \r\ncommunity assembling for a hoe-down, then dancing a two-step to music with lyrics. \r\nThat is apparently how many early English poems originated. And the more regular \r\nmeter of the evolving poems would suit music well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this the oldest carpe diem poem in the English language? \r\nWhan the turuf is thy tour\r\n(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa the 13th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n1.\r\nWhen the turf is your tower\r\nand the pit is your bower,\r\nyour pale white skin and throat\r\nshall be sullen worms to note.\r\nWhat help to you, then,\r\nwas all your worldly hope? \r\n\r\n2.\r\nWhen the turf is your tower\r\nand the grave is your bower,\r\nyour pale white throat and skin\r\nworm-eaten from within ...\r\nwhat hope of my help then?\r\n\r\nNOTE: The second translation leans more to the lover\'s complaint and carpe \r\ndiem genres, with the poet pointing out to his prospective lover that by \r\ndenying him her favors she make take her virtue to the grave where worms will \r\nend her virginity in macabre fashion. This poem may be an ancient precursor of \r\npoems like Andrew Marvell\'s To His Coy Mistress. \r\n\r\nWhan the turuf is thy tour,\r\nAnd thy pit is thy bour,\r\nThy fel and thy whit\xeb throt\xeb\r\nShullen worm\xebs to not\xeb.\r\nWhat help\xebth thee thenn\xeb\r\nAl the worild\xeb wenn\xeb?\r\n\r\n\r\nEch day me com\xebth tydinges thre\r\n(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa the 13th to 14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\nEach day Im plagued by three doles,\r\nThese gargantuan weights on my soul:\r\nFirst, that I must somehow exit this fen.\r\nSecond, that I cannot know when.\r\nAnd yet its the third that torments me so,\r\nBecause I don\'t know where the hell I will go! \r\nEch day me com\xebth tydinges thre,\r\nFor wel swith\xeb sore ben he:\r\nThe on is that Ich shal henn\xeb,\r\nThat other that Ich not whenn\xeb,\r\nThe thridd\xeb is my mest\xeb car\xeb,\r\nThat Ich not whider Ich shal far\xeb.\r\n\r\nIch have y-don al myn youth\r\n(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa the 13th to 14th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\nI have done it all my youth:\r\nOften, often, and often!\r\nI have loved long and yearned zealously ...\r\nAnd oh what grief it has brought me! \r\nIch have y-don al myn youth,\r\nOft\xeb, ofte, and ofte;\r\nLonge y-loved and yerne y-beden \r\nFul dere it is y-bought!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my translation of a wonderful poem by an early Scottish \r\nmaster, William Dunbar. Sweet Rose of Virtue has been one of my favorite poems \r\nsince I first read it. I decided to translate it myself, to make it \r\nmore accessible to modern readers:\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\nThe original poem by William Dunbar:\r\n\r\nSweit rois of vertew and of gentilnes,\r\nDelytsum lyllie of everie lustynes,\r\nRichest in bontie and in bewtie cleir\r\nAnd everie vertew that is deir,\r\nExcept onlie that ye are mercyles.\r\n\r\nInto your garthe this day I did persew.\r\nThair saw I flowris that fresche wer of hew,\r\nBaithe quhyte and rid, moist lusty wer to seyne,\r\nAnd halsum herbis upone stalkis grene,\r\nYit leif nor flour fynd could I nane of rew.\r\n\r\nI dout that Merche with his caild blastis keyne\r\nHes slane this gentill herbe that I of mene,\r\nQuhois petewous deithe dois to my hart sic pane\r\nThat I wald mak to plant his rute agane,\r\nSo that confortand his levis unto me bene.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow skruketh rose and lylie flour \r\n(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa \r\n11th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow skruketh rose and lylie flour, \r\nNow skyward the rose and the lily flower, \r\nskruketh = break forth, burst open\r\nThat whilen ber that suete savour \r\nThat will bear for awhile that sweet savor:\r\nIn somer, that suete tyde; \r\nIn summer, that sweet tide;\r\nNe is no quene so stark ne stour, \r\nThere is no queen so stark in her power stour = strong, stern, hardy\r\nNe no luedy so bryht in bour \r\nNor no lady so bright in her bower\r\nThat ded ne shal by glyde: \r\nThat dead shall not glide by:\r\nWhoso wol fleshye lust for-gon and hevene-blisse abyde \r\nWhoever will forgo lust, in heavenly bliss will abide\r\nOn Jhesu be is thoht anon, that tharled was ys side. \r\nWith his thoughts on Jesus anon, thralled at his \r\nside. tharled = thralled?, made a serf?, bound?\r\n\r\nA similar poem to the one above, in time and language, is\r\nBlow Northerne Wynd, which has been called the most ancient love \r\npoem in the English language, perhaps composed during the reign of King John. \r\nBut I prefer the lovely poem above, if not the Christian sentiments of the \r\nclosing couplet.\r\n\r\nAdam Lay Ybounden\r\n(anonymous Medieval English Lyric, circa \r\nearly 15th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAdam lay bound, bound in a bond;\r\nFour thousand winters, he thought, were not too long.\r\nAnd all was for an apple, an apple that he took,\r\nAs clerics now find written in their book.\r\nBut had the apple not been taken, or had it never been,\r\nWe\'d never have had our Lady, heaven\'s queen.\r\nSo bless\xe9d be the time the apple was taken thus;\r\nTherefore we sing, God is gracious!\r\n\r\nThe poem has also been rendered as Adam lay i-bounden and Adam lay i-bowndyn. \r\nHere is the original poem in one of its ancient forms:\r\n\r\nAdam lay i-bounden, bounden in a bond;\r\nFoure thousand winter thought he not too long.\r\nAnd all was for an apple, an apple that he took,\r\nAs clerkes finden written in theire book.\r\nNe hadde the apple taken been, the apple taken been,\r\nNe hadde never our Lady aye been heavene queen.\r\nBlessed be the time that apple taken was,\r\nTherefore we moun singen, Deo gracias!\r\n\r\nI Sing of a Maiden\r\n(anonymous Medieval English Lyric, circa \r\nearly 15th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI sing of a maiden \r\nThat is matchless.\r\nThe\r\nKing of all Kings \r\nFor her son she chose.\r\nHe came also as still\r\nTo his mother\'s breast\r\nAs April dew\r\nFalling on the grass.\r\nHe came also as still\r\nTo his mother\'s bower\r\nAs April dew \r\nFalling on the flower.\r\nHe came also as still\r\nTo where his mother lay\r\nAs April dew\r\nFalling on the spray.\r\nMother and maiden?\r\nNever one, but she!\r\nWell may such a lady\r\nGod\'s mother be!\r\n\r\nHere is the original poem in one of its ancient forms:\r\n\r\nI sing of a maiden (virgin)\r\nThat is makeles: (matchless / mateless / spotless)\r\nKing of alle kinges \r\nTo her sone she chees. (for her son she chose) \r\nHe cam also stille (He came as silently)\r\nTher his moder was (where his mother was)\r\nAs dewe in Aprille \r\nThat falleth on the gras. \r\nHe cam also stille \r\nTo his modres bowr (mother\'s bower, perhaps meaning both bedroom and leafy nest)\r\nAs dewe in Aprille \r\nThat falleth on the flowr.\r\nHe cam also stille \r\nTher his moder lay \r\nAs dewe in Aprille \r\nThat falleth on the spray (blossom and/or budding twig)\r\nModer and maiden (Mother and virgin) \r\nWas nevere noon but she: \r\nWell may swich a lady (such a lady)\r\nGodes moder be. \r\n\r\n\r\nIN LIBRARIOS\r\nby Thomas Campion\r\n\r\nImpressionum plurium librum laudat\r\nLibrarius; scortum nec non minus leno.\r\n\r\nNovelties\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBooksellers laud authors for novel editions\r\nas pimps praise their whores for exotic positions.\r\n\r\n Brut (circa 1100 AD, \r\nwritten by Layamon, an excerpt)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n Now he stands on a hill overlooking the Avon,\r\nseeing steel fishes girded with swords in the stream,\r\ntheir swimming days done,\r\ntheir scales a-gleam like gold-plated shields,\r\ntheir fish-spines floating like shattered spears.\r\n\r\nLayamon\'s Brut is a 32,000-line poem composed \r\nin Middle English that shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence and contains the \r\nfirst known reference to King Arthur in English. The passage above is a good \r\nexample of Layamon\'s gift for imagery. It\'s interesting, I think, that a \r\nthousand years ago a poet was dabbling in surrealism, with dead warriors being \r\ndescribed as if they were both men and fish. \r\n\r\nNow here\'s a poem whose second line enthralled C. S. Lewis. I\'m not sure about \r\nthe source of the original poem, but my translation is based on a poem of the \r\nsame name by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ...\r\n\r\nTegner\'s Drapa\r\n\r\nloose translation/interpretation by  \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI heard a voice, that cried,\r\nBalder the beautiful lies dead, lies dead . . .\r\na voice like the flight of white cranes\r\nintent on a sun sailing high overhead\r\nbut a sun now irretrievably setting.\r\n\r\nThen I saw the suns corpse\r\ndead beyond all begetting\r\nborne through disconsolate skies\r\nas blasts from the Nifel-heim rang out with dread,\r\nBalder lies dead, our fair Balder lies dead! . . .\r\n\r\nLostthe sweet runes of his tongue,\r\nso sweet every lark hushed its singing!\r\nLost, lost foreverhis beautiful face,\r\nthe grace of his smile, all the girls hearts wild-winging!\r\nO, who ever thought such strange words might be said, \r\n\r\nas Balder lies dead, gentle Balder lies dead! . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\'s one of the first Old English/Anglo-Saxon poems to employ a refrain:\r\n\r\nDeor\'s Lament (Anglo Saxon poem, circa 10th century AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWeland knew the agony of exile.\r\nThat indomitable smith was wracked by grief.\r\nHe endured countless troubles:\r\nsorrows were his only companions\r\nin his frozen island dungeon\r\nafter Nithad had fettered him,\r\nmany strong-but-supple sinew-bonds\r\nbinding the better man.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nBeadohild mourned her brothers\' deaths\r\nbut even more, her own sad state\r\nonce she discovered herself with child.\r\nShe predicted nothing good could come of it.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that the Geat\'s moans for Matilda,\r\nhis lady, were limitless,\r\nthat his sorrowful love for her\r\nrobbed him of regretless sleep.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nFor thirty winters Theodric ruled\r\nthe M\xe6ring stronghold with an iron hand;\r\nmany knew this and moaned.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nWe have also heard of Ermanaric\'s wolfish ways,\r\nof how he held wide sway in the realm of the Goths.\r\nHe was a grim king! Many a warrior sat,\r\nfull of cares and maladies of the mind,\r\nwishing constantly that his kingdom might be overthrown.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nIf a man sits long enough, sorrowful and anxious,\r\nbereft of joy, his mind constantly darkening,\r\nsoon it seems to him that his troubles are endless.\r\nThen he must consider that the wise Lord\r\noften moves through the earth\r\ngranting some men honor, glory and fame,\r\nbut others only shame and hardship.\r\nThis I will say for myself:\r\nthat for awhile I was the Heodeninga\'s scop,\r\ndear to my lord. My name was Deor.\r\nFor many winters I held a fine office,\r\nfaithfully serving a just lord. But now Heorrenda\r\na man skilful in songs, has received the estate\r\nthe protector of warriors gave me.\r\nThat passed away; this also may.\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament or The Wife\'s Complaint is an Old English (Anglo Saxon) \r\npoem found in the Exeter Book which is generally considered to be an elegy in the \r\nmanner of the German frauenlied, or woman\'s song, although there are \r\nother interpretations of the poem\'s genre and purpose. The Exeter Book has been \r\ndated to 960-990 AD, but of course the poem may have been written earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI draw these words from deep wells of my grief,\r\ncare-worn, unutterably sad.\r\nI can recount woes I\'ve borne since birth,\r\npresent and past, never more than now.\r\nI have won, from my exile-paths, only pain.\r\n\r\nFirst, my lord forsook his folk, left,\r\ncrossed the seas\' tumult, far from our people.\r\nSince then, I\'ve known\r\nwrenching dawn-griefs, dark mournings ... oh where,\r\nwhere can he be?\r\n\r\nThen I, too, lefta lonely, lordless refugee,\r\nfull of unaccountable desires!\r\nBut the man\'s kinsmen schemed secretly\r\nto estrange us, divide us, keep us apart,\r\nacross earth\'s wide kingdom, and my heart broke.\r\n\r\nThen my lord spoke:\r\nTake up residence here.\r\nI had few friends in this unknown, cheerless\r\nregion, none close.\r\nChrist, I felt lost!\r\n\r\nThen I thought I had found a well-matched man \r\none meant for me,\r\nbut unfortunately he\r\nwas ill-starred and blind, with a devious mind,\r\nfull of murderous intentions, plotting some crime!\r\n\r\nBefore God we\r\nvowed never to part, not till kingdom come, never!\r\nBut now that\'s all changed, forever \r\nour friendship done, severed.\r\nI must hear, far and near, contempt for my husband.\r\n\r\nSo other men bade me, Go, live in the grove,\r\nbeneath the great oaks, in an earth-cave, alone.\r\nIn this ancient cave-dwelling I am lost and oppressed \r\nthe valleys are dark, the hills immense,\r\nand this cruel-briared enclosurean arid abode!\r\n\r\nThe injustice assails memy lord\'s absence!\r\nOn earth there are lovers who share the same bed\r\nwhile I pass through life dead in this dark abscess\r\nwhere I wilt, summer days unable to rest\r\nor forget the sorrows of my life\'s hard lot.\r\n\r\nA young woman must always be\r\nstern, hard-of-heart, unmoved,\r\nopposing breast-cares and her heartaches\' legions.\r\nShe must appear cheerful\r\neven in a tumult of grief.\r\n\r\nLike a criminal exiled to a far-off land,\r\nmoaning beneath insurmountable cliffs,\r\nmy weary-minded love, drenched by wild storms\r\nand caught in the clutches of anguish,\r\nis reminded constantly of our former happiness.\r\n\r\nWoe be it to them who abide in longing.\r\n\r\nNow here\'s my translation of a another poem by an early Scottish master, William \r\nDunbar.

Burch\r\n\r\n. . . qui laetificat juventutem meam . . .\r\nShe was the joy of my youth,\r\nand now she is gone.\r\n. . . requiescat in pace . . .\r\nMay she rest in peace.\r\n. . . amen . . .\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I was touched by this Latin prayer, which I discovered in a novel I \r\nread as a teenager. I later decided to incorporate it into a poem. \r\nFrom what I now understand, ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam means to \r\nthe God who gives joy to my youth, but I am sticking with my original \r\ninterpretation: a lament for a little girl at her funeral. The phrase can be \r\ntraced back to Saint Jerome\'s translation of Psalm 42 in the\r\nVulgate Latin Bible (circa 385 AD).\r\n\r\nWhew ... that\'s quite a bit of work for someone who was damn sure he\'d never translate a line of poetry in his life!
