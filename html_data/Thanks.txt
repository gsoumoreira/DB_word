Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am with you, we stay up all night. \r\nWhen you\'re not here, I can\'t go to sleep. \r\nPraise God for these two insomnias! \r\nAnd the difference between them.\r\nJalaluddin Rumi, translation by Coleman Barks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI became infected with happiness tonight \r\nas I wandered idly, singing in the starlight. \r\nNow\r\nI\'m wonderfully contagious\r\nso kiss me!\r\nHafiz, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest Old English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn, \r\na lyric of praise, gratitude and thanksgiving which was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the scholar \r\nBede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who worked at the monastery of \r\nWhitby, a small English fishing village. C\xe6dmon, according to the Venerable Bede, was given the gift of poetic composition by an angel.\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn \r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow we must honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the eternal Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the first Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\r\nGuardian of mankind. Then he,\r\nthe eternal Lord,\r\nafterwards made the middle earth for men, Master almighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\npass into nothingness ...\r\nJohn Keats\r\n\r\n\r\ndont forget ...\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\ndont forget to remember \r\nthat Space is curved \r\n(like your Heart) \r\nand that even Light is bent \r\nby your Gravity.\r\n\r\nI dedicated this poem to the love of my life, but you are welcome to dedicate it \r\nto the love of yours, if you like it. The opening lines were\r\ninspired by a famous love poem by e. e. cummings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking into Heaven\r\nwith\r\nLove and Gratitude\r\non Thanksgiving Day November 23, 2006\r\n\r\nby\r\nHiroshima survivor Takashi Thomas Tanemori\r\n\r\nTurning my face to Heaven\r\nI sense rather than see\r\nthe endless blue.\r\nBeyond the dancing leaves and soaring hawk,\r\nits immeasurable stillness\r\nreflects the wonder of all Creation.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nMorning dew glittering in the dawn,\r\nlike precious jewels;\r\nand twinkling stars echoing in the silent night,\r\nlike the songs of angels,\r\nWe gather the fruits of the earth,\r\ntill the barn is overflowing with bounty.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nMy heart fills with countless blessings:\r\nfood, shelter, clothing and friends to be encircled.\r\nLooking back, I see how\r\nmy stumbling steps have become a path\r\nand how, on this lonely road,\r\nI have never been alone.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe kindness of many has been\r\nlike a spring rain,\r\nbringing new life to my heart,\r\nas a Blade of Grass ever emerging\r\nfrom the ashes of the Past,\r\nI stand, Amazed at my blessings,\r\ngrateful for His Wonders!\r\n\r\n\r\nHighway Apple Trees\r\nby Rhina P. Espaillat\r\n\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows,\r\nmiraculous, above old caps and cans.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows\r\nIf they were meant to ripen under those\r\nslow summer clouds, cooled by their small green fans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows,\r\nnodding assent to every wind that blows,\r\nuselessly safe, far from our knives and pans.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows\r\nwhat future orchards live in cores one throws\r\nfrom glossy limousines or battered vans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest; it just grows,\r\ndenied the gift of purpose we suppose\r\nwould give it worth, conferred by human hands.\r\nThese apples, maybe sweet (nobody knows),\r\nsoften and fall, as autumn comes and goes,\r\ninto a sleep well-earned as any mans.\r\nNobody seeds this harvest, it just grows.\r\nThese apples may be sweet. Nobody knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne apple, alone\r\nin the abandoned orchard\r\nreddens for winter\r\n\r\n \r\nPatrick Blanche, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... you are whatever a moon has always meant \r\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you ...\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\n\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite plum blossoms\r\nthough the hour is late,\r\na glimpse of dawn\r\n\r\n \r\nYosa \r\nBuson, loose translation by Michael R. Burch; this is believed to be Buson\'s \r\ndeath poem and he is said to have died before dawn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf fields of autumn flowers\r\ncan shed their blossoms, shameless,\r\nwhy cant I also frolic here  \r\nas fearless, and as blameless?\r\n\x97Ono no Komachi, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Clear Midnight\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nThis is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,\r\nAway from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,\r\nThee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou lovest \r\nbest.\r\nNight, sleep, death and the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhistle on, twilight whippoorwill,\r\nsolemn evangelist\r\nof loneliness\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope Is A Thing With Feathersby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nHope is a thing with feathers\r\nThat perches in the soul\r\nAnd sings a tune without words\r\nAnd never stops at all.\r\n\r\nAnd sweetest, in the gale, is heard\r\nAnd sore must be the storm\r\nThat could abash the little bird\r\nThat keeps so many warm.\r\n\r\nIve heard it in the chilliest land\r\nAnd on the strangest sea\r\nYet, never, in extremity\r\nIt ask a crumb of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first morning of autumn:\r\nthe mirror I investigate\r\nreflects my fathers face\r\n\r\n \r\nShiki Masaoka, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning My Studies \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\'d me so much,\r\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\r\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\r\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\'d me so much,\r\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\'d to go any farther,\r\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWild geese pass\r\n\tleaving the emptiness of heaven\r\nrevealed \r\n\r\n \r\nTakaha Shugyo, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament\r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh butterfly,\r\nwhat dreams do you ply\r\nwith your beautiful wings?\r\n\r\n \r\nChiyo-ni, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease\r\nby R. S. Sam Gwynn\r\n\r\nSlow for the sake of flowers as they turn\r\n Toward sunlight, graceful as a line of sail\r\n Coming into \r\nthe wind. Slow for the mill\r\nWheel\'s heft and plummet, for the chug and churn\r\n Of water as it gathers, for the frail\r\n Half-life of \r\nspraylets as they toss and spill.\r\n\r\nFor all that lags and eases, all that shows\r\n The winding-downward and diminished scale\r\n Of days \r\ndeclining to a twilit chill,\r\nBreathe quietly, release into repose:\r\n\r\n \r\nBe still.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatching wan moonlight\r\nilluminate trees,\r\nmy heart also brims,\r\noverflowing\r\nwith autumn.\r\n\x97Ono no Komachi, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first soft snow:\r\n\tleaves of the awed jonquil \r\nbow low\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poem of Poems\r\nby Greg Alan Brownderville\r\n\r\nA boy passes ghost-like through a curtain of weeping willow.\r\nIn rainbow-stained apparel, birds are singing a cappella.\r\nSuddenly I sense it, in the birds and in the child:\r\nThe world is a poem growing wild.\r\n\r\nA dewdrop on a blade of grass soon slips from where it clung\r\nLike a perfect word that gathers on the tip of a poet\'s tongue.\r\nAnd men are merely characters to love and be defiled.\r\nGod is a poem growing wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, investigate loneliness!\r\na solitary leaf\r\nclings to the Kiri tree\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had thought to pluck\r\nthe flower of forgetfulness\r\nonly to find it \r\nalready blossoming in his heart.\r\n\x97Ono no Komachi, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate autumn; now all \r\nthe golden leaves turn black underfoot:\r\nsoot\r\n\r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEndymion\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\r\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\r\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\r\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\r\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\r\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\r\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\r\nOf all the unhealthy and o\'er-darkn\'d ways\r\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\r\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\r\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\r\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\r\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\r\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\r\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\r\n\'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,\r\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\r\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\r\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\r\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\r\nPouring unto us from the heaven\'s brink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn empty road\r\nlonelier than abandonment:\r\nthis autumn evening\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm And Free\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nIt is a beauteous evening, calm and free,\r\nThe holy time is quiet as a Nun\r\nBreathless with adoration; the broad sun\r\nIs sinking down in its tranquillity;\r\nThe gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the Sea:\r\nListen! the mighty Being is awake,\r\nAnd doth with his eternal motion make\r\nA sound like thundereverlastingly.\r\nDear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,\r\nIf thou appear untouched by solemn thought,\r\nThy nature is not therefore less divine:\r\nThou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year;\r\nAnd worship\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine,\r\nGod being with thee when we know it not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis darkening autumn night:\r\nmy neighbor, \r\nhow does he continue?\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowlyEden\r\nLips unused to thee\r\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\r\nAs the fainting bee\r\n\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums\r\nCounts his nectarsalights\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasses wilt:\r\nthe braking locomotive\r\ngrinds to a halt\r\n\r\n \r\nYamaguchi Seishi, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Is Just to Say\r\nby William Carlos Williams\r\n\r\nI have eaten\r\nthe plums\r\nthat were in\r\nthe icebox\r\n\r\nand which\r\nyou were probably\r\nsaving\r\nfor breakfast\r\n\r\nForgive me\r\nthey were delicious\r\nso sweet\r\nand so cold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first chill rain:\r\npoor monkey, you too could use\r\na woven cape of straw\r\n\r\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers. Dont cry\r\nthe best gesture of my brain is less than\r\nyour eyelids flutter which says\r\n\r\nwe are for each other: then\r\nlaugh, leaning back in my arms\r\nfor lifes not a paragraph\r\n\r\nAnd death i think is no parenthesis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\r\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\r\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\r\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\r\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\r\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\r\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\r\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\r\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\r\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\r\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\r\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\r\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOde to Autumn\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness, \r\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun; \r\nConspiring with him how to load and bless \r\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run; \r\nTo bend with apples the moss\'d cottage-trees,\r\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; \r\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells \r\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more, \r\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees, \r\nUntil they think warm days will never cease;\r\nFor Summer has o\'erbrimm\'d their clammy cells. \r\n\r\nWho hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? \r\nSometimes whoever seeks abroad may find \r\nThee sitting careless on a granary floor, \r\nThy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\r\nOr on a half-reap\'d furrow sound asleep, \r\nDrowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook \r\nSpares the next swath and all its twin\xe8d flowers: \r\nAnd sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep \r\nSteady thy laden head across a brook;\r\nOr by a cyder-press, with patient look, \r\nThou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours. \r\n\r\nWhere are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they? \r\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too,\x97 \r\nWhile barr\xe8d clouds bloom the soft-dying day\r\nAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; \r\nThen in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn \r\nAmong the river-sallows, borne aloft \r\nOr sinking as the light wind lives or dies; \r\nAnd full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\r\nHedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft \r\nThe redbreast whistles from a garden-croft; \r\nAnd gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To )\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 73\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou see\x92st the twilight of such day\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west;\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\r\nDeath\x92s second self, that seals up all in rest.\r\nIn me thou see\x92st the glowing of such fire,\r\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\r\nAs the deathbed whereon it must expire,\r\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\r\nThis thou perceiv\x92st, which makes thy love more strong,\r\nTo love that well which thou must leave ere long.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
