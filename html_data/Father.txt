No one ever thanked him.\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\nwho had driven out the cold\nand polished my good shoes as well.\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAn excerpt from My Father was a Farmer: a Ballad\nby Robert Burns\nMyfather \nwas a farmer upon the Carrick border, O,\nAnd carefully he bred me in decency and order, O;\nHe bade me act a manly part, though I had neer a farthing, O;\nFor without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O.\nAn excerpt from "The Gift" \nby Li-Young Lee\n\nTo pull the metal splinter from my palm\nmy father recited a story in a low voice.\nI watched his lovely face and not the blade.\nBefore the story ended, he\'d removed \nthe iron sliver I thought I\'d die from.\nI can\'t remember the tale, \nbut hear his voice still, a well \nof dark water, a prayer. \nAnd I recall his hands, \ntwo measures of tenderness \nhe laid against my face ...\n\n\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\nby William Wordsworth\n\n\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\n A rainbow in the sky:\nSo was it when my life began;\nSo is it now I am a man;\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\n Or let me die!\nThe Child is father of the Man;\nI could wish my days to be\nBound each to each by natural piety.\n\nFull Fathom Five\nby William Shakespeare\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n Of his bones are coral made;\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n Nothing of him that doth fade\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\n Ding-dong.\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\n\nTo Her Father with Some Verses\nby Anne Bradstreet\n\nMost truly honoured, and as truly dear,\nIf worth in me or ought I do appear,\nWho can of right better demand the same\nThan may your worthy self from whom it came?\nThe principal might yield a greater sum,\nYet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb;\nMy stock\'s so small I know not how to pay,\nMy bond remains in force unto this day;\nYet for part payment take this simple mite,\nWhere nothing\'s to be had, kings loose their right.\nSuch is my debt I may not say forgive,\nBut as I can, I\'ll pay it while I live;\nSuch is my bond, none can discharge but I,\nYet paying is not paid until I die.\n\nTo My Dear and Loving Husband\nby Anne Bradstreet\n\nIf ever two were one, then surely we.\nIf ever man were loved by wife, then thee;\nIf ever wife was happy in a man,\nCompare with me ye women if you can.\nI prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,\nOr all the riches that the East doth hold.\nMy love is such that rivers cannot quench,\nNor ought but love from thee give recompense.\nThy love is such I can no way repay;\nThe heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.\nThen while we live, in love let\'s so persever,\nThat when we live no more we may live ever.\n\nAn excerpt from my father moved through dooms of love\nby e. e. cummings\n\nmy father moved through dooms of love\nthrough sames of am through haves of give,\nsinging each morning out of each night\nmy father moved through depths of height ...\n\nWorking Late\nby Louis Simpson\n\nA light is on in my father\'s study.\nStill up? he says, and we are silent,\nlooking at the harbor lights,\nlistening to the surf\nand the creak of coconut boughs.\n\nHe is working late on cases.\nNo impassioned speech! He argues from evidence,\nactually pacing out and measuring,\nwhile the fans revolving on the ceiling\nwinnow the true from the false.\n\nOnce he passed a brass curtain rod\nthrough a head made out of plaster\nand showed the jury the angle of fire\nwhere the murderer must have stood.\nFor years, all through my childhood,\nif I opened a closet . . . bang!\nThere would be the dead man\'s head\nwith a black hole in the forehead.\n\nAll the arguing in the world\nwill not stay the moon.\nShe has come all the way from Russia\nto gaze for a while in a mango tree\nand light the wall of a veranda,\nbefore resuming her interrupted journey\nbeyond the harbor and the lighthouse\nat Port Royal, turning away\nfrom land to the open sea.\n\nYet, nothing in nature changes, from that day to this,\nshe is still the mother of us all.\nI can see the drifting offshore lights,\nblack posts where the pelicans brood.\n\nAnd the light that used to shine\nat night in my father\'s study\nnow shines as late in mine.\n\nLay Back the Darkness\nby Edward Hirsch\n\nMy father in the night shuffling from room to room\non an obscure mission through the hallway.\n\nHelp me, spirits, to penetrate his dream\nand ease his restless passage.\n\nLay back the darkness for a salesman\nwho could charm everything but the shadows,\n\nan immigrant who stands on the threshold\nof a vast night\n\nwithout his walker or his cane\nand cannot remember what he meant to say,\n\nthough his right arm is raised, as if in prophecy,\nwhile his left shakes uselessly in warning.\n\nMy father in the night shuffling from room to room\nis no longer a father or a husband or a son,\n\nbut a boy standing on the edge of a forest\nlistening to the distant cry of wolves,\n\nto wild dogs,\nto primitive wingbeats shuddering in the treetops.\n\nRequiescat\nby Oscar Wilde\n\nTread lightly, she is near\nUnder the snow,\nSpeak gently, she can hear\nThe daisies grow.\n\nAll her bright golden hair\nTarnished with rust,\nShe that was young and fair\nFallen to dust.\n\nLily-like, white as snow,\nShe hardly knew\nShe was a woman, so\nSweetly she grew.\n\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\nLie on her breast,\nI vex my heart alone,\nShe is at rest.\n\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\nLyre or sonnet,\nAll my life\'s buried here,\nHeap earth upon it.\n\nBread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\n\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nCradle Song\nby William Blake\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n\nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n\nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\nLullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n     \n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n     \n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n     \n\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\nShine, Perishing Republic\nby Robinson Jeffers\n\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\n\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\n\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\n\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\n\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\n\nThe Forge\nby Seamus Heaney\n\nAll I know is a door into the dark.\nOutside, old axles and iron hoops rusting;\nInside, the hammered anvils short-pitched ring,\nThe unpredictable fantail of sparks\nOr hiss when a new shoe toughens in water.\nThe anvil must be somewhere in the centre,\nHorned as a unicorn, at one end and square,\nSet there immoveable: an altar\nWhere he expends himself in shape and music.\nSometimes, leather-aproned, hairs in his nose,\nHe leans out on the jamb, recalls a clatter\nOf hoofs where traffic is flashing in rows;\nThen grunts and goes in, with a slam and flick\nTo beat real iron out, to work the bellows.\nThe Divine Image\nby William BlakeTo Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nAll pray in their distress;\nAnd to these virtues of delight\nReturn their thankfulness.For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs God, our father dear,\nAnd Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs Man, his child and care.For Mercy has a human heart,\nPity a human face,\nAnd Love, the human form divine,\nAnd Peace, the human dress.Then every man, of every clime,\nThat prays in his distress,\nPrays to the human form divine,\nLove, Mercy, Pity, Peace.And all must love the human form,\nIn heathen, Turk, or Jew;\nWhere Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell\nThere God is dwelling too.\n\n\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \n\n\n\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\nThose that I guard I do not love;\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\nNo likely end could bring them loss\nOr leave them happier than before.\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\nA lonely impulse of delight\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\nA waste of breath the years behind\nIn balance with this life, this death.\n\n \n\nOn My First Son\nby Ben Jonson\n\n      Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\n    My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\n    Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\n    Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\n    O, could I lose all father now! For why\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\n    As what he loves may never like too much.\n    \n\nThe earliest Old English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn, \nwhich was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the scholar \nBede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who worked at the monastery of \nWhitby, a small English fishing village.  \nC\xe6dmon, as Bede\'s story goes, was given the gift of poetic composition by an \nangel.\n\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn \n\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNow we must honourheaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\nthe work of the Glory-Father.     First he, the eternal Lord,\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\nThen he, the first Poet, created heaven as a roof\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\nGuardian of mankind. Then he,\nthe eternal Lord,\nafterwards made the middle earth for men, Master almighty.\n\nLines from C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn are reminiscent of the much later work of Gerard Manley \nHopkins. For instance, compare the first line above to certain lines from this \npoem by Hopkins:\n\n\nA Red, Red Rose\nby Robert Burns\n\n\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\n   \nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\n   \nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\n   \nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\n\n\nThe Garden Of Love\n  by William Blake\n\n    I laid me down upon a bank,\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\nI heard among the rushes dank\nWeeping, weeping.\n \nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\n \nI went to the Garden of Love,\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\nWhere I used to play on the green.\n \nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\n \nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\n\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\nby Walter Savage Landor\n\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\n\n\nMethought I Saw\nby John Milton\n\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\n Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\n\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\n\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\n\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\n\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\n\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\n Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\n\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\n\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\n I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\n\n\nOne Art\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\nso many things seem filled with the intent\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\n\nLose something every day.  Accept the fluster\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\n\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \nto travel.  None of these will bring disaster.\n\nI lost my mother\'s watch.  And look! my last, or\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\n\nI lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\n\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.  It\'s evident\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\n\nTo Earthwardby Robert Frost\n\nLove at the lips was touch\nAs sweet as I could bear;\nAnd once that seemed too much;\nI lived on air\n\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\nThe flow of  was it musk\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\nDownhill at dusk?\n\nI had the swirl and ache\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\nThat when theyre gathered shake\nDew on the knuckle.\n\nI craved strong sweets, but those\nSeemed strong when I was young:\nThe petal of the rose\nIt was that stung.\n\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\nThat is not dashed with pain\nAnd weariness and fault;\nI crave the stain\n\nOf tears, the aftermark\nOf almost too much love,\nThe sweet of bitter bark\nAnd burning clove.\n\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\nI take away my hand\nFrom leaning on it hard\nIn grass or sand,\n\nThe hurt is not enough:\nI long for weight and strength\nTo feel the earth as rough\nTo all my length.\n\n\nAs the Ruin Falls\nby C. S. Lewis\n\nAll this is flashy rhetoric about loving you \nI never had a selfless thought since I was born.\nI am mercenary and self-seeking through and through;\nI want God, you, all friends merely to serve my turn.\n\nPeace, re-assurance, pleasure are the goals I seek;\nI cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin;\nI talk of love  a scholar\'s parrot may talk Greek,\nBut self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.\n\nOnly that you now have taught me (but how late!) my lack,\nI see the chasm; and everything you are was making\nMy heart into a bridge by which I might get back\nFrom exile and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.\nFor this I bless you as the ruin falls. The pains\nYou give me are more precious than all other gains.\n\n\nRequiem\nby Robert L. Stevenson\n\nUnder the wide and starry sky\nDig the grave and let me lie.\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\n\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\nHere he lies where he longed to be,\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\nAnd the hunter home from the hill.\n\n\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving\nby George Gordon, Lord \nByron\n\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\n So late into the night,\nThough the heart be still as loving,\n And the moon be still as bright.\n\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\n And the soul outwears the breast,\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\n And love itself have rest.\n\nThough the night was made for loving,\n And the day returns too soon,\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\n By the light of the moon.\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
