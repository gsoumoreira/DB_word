Burch, editor, The HyperTexts\n\n\nFor what it\'s worth, these are my top ten poems, hymns and songs of \nconsolation:\n\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water by Paul Simon\nIt is Well with My Soul by Horatio G. Spafford \nDo Not Stand at My Grave and Weep by Mary Elizabeth Frye\nA Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever by John Keats\nIf I Speak with the Tongues of Men and of Angels by Saint Paul \nMusic When Soft Voices Die by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nA Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London\nby Dylan Thomas\nDeath Shall Have No Dominion\nby Dylan Thomas\nImagine by John Lennon\nA Change is Gonna Come by Sam Cooke \n\nHonorable Mention: Let It Be by Paul McCartney, Here Comes the Sun by George \nHarrison, You\'ve Got a Friend by Carole King, Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen, \nYou\x92ll Never Walk Alone by Richard Rodgers  Oscar Hammerstein II, since feeling is first \nby\ne. e. cummings, A Blessing by James Wright, Lullaby by W. H. Auden, The \nDivine Image by William Blake,\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold by William Wordsworth, \nHope Is A Thing With Feathers by Emily Dickinson, Peace by Sara Teasdale, \nCredo by Edward Arlington Robinson, Heaven-Haven\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins, Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer\'s Day?\nby William Shakespeare, 23rd Psalm by King David\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\n\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep,\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\nI am the swift uplifting rush\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\nI am the soft star-shine at night.\nDo not stand at my grave and cry,\nI am not there; I did not die.\n\nThe poem above is sometimes called \nI Am due to its repetition of the phrase. Was \nthe poem inspired? The Hebrew name for God, \nYHWH, means I am or I am that I am. And there does seem to be \nsomething magical about the poem, as it was written by a woman who, to our \nknowledge, had never written a poem before. Mary Elizabeth Frye was an orphan with no \nformal education. In 1932 she and her husband hosted a young Jewish woman, \nMargaret Schwarzkopf, who was fleeing the Holocaust. When she received news that \nher mother had died in Germany, the heartbroken houseguest\ntold Frye in despair that she had never had the chance to stand by my \nmother\'s grave and shed a tear. Frye found herself composing the poem above on \na ripped-off section of a brown paper shopping bag. She said the words just \ncame to her. In a 1996 Bookworm poll, Do Not Stand at My Grave and \nWeep was voted one of Great Britain\'s most popular poems despite not even being \nnominated by critics for the list. There were around 30,000 write-in votes for \nthe mysterious elegy. \n\n\n\nThe first soft snow:\nleaves of the awed jonquil \nbow low\n\n Matsuo Basho, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\npass into nothingness ...\nJohn Keats\n\n\n\nHappiness is like a butterfly: \nthe more you chase it, the more it will elude \nyou. \nBut if you turn your attention to other things, \nit will come and sit softly \non your shoulder.\nHenry David Thoreau\n\n\n\n\nI like not only to be loved but also to be told that I am loved. \nThe realm \nof silence is large enough beyond the grave. \nThis is the world of light and \nspeech. \nAnd I shall take leave to tell you that you are very dear.\n\x97George Eliot\n\n\n\nI expect to pass this way but once; \nany good therefore that I can do, \nor any \nkindness that I can show to any fellow creature, \nlet me do it now. \nLet me \nnot defer or neglect it, \nfor I shall not pass this way again.\nEtienne Griellet\n\n\n\n\nIt takes courage to push yourself to places that you have never been before, \nto test your limits, \nto break through barriers. \nAnd the day came \nwhen the risk it took to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.\nAna\xefs Nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh God of dust and rainbows, help us see \n\nthat without dust the rainbow would \nnot be.\nLangston Hughes\n\n\n\nLove calls, everywhere and always.\nWe\'re sky bound. \nAre you coming?\nRumi\n\n\n\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\nby William Wordsworth\n\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\n A rainbow in the sky:\nSo was it when my life began;\nSo is it now I am a man;\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\n Or let me die!\nThe Child is father of the Man;\nI could wish my days to be\nBound each to each by natural piety.\n\n\n\nCredo\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\n\nI cannot find my way: there is no star\nIn all the shrouded heavens anywhere;\nAnd there is not a whisper in the air\nOf any living voice but one so far\nThat I can hear it only as a bar\nOf lost, imperial music, played when fair\nAnd angel fingers wove, and unaware,\nDead leaves to garlands where no roses are.\n\nNo, there is not a glimmer, nor a call,\nFor one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears,\nThe black and awful chaos of the night;\nFor through it allabove, beyond it all\nI know the far sent message of the years,\nI feel the coming glory of the light.\n\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \n)\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a prayer-poem that I wrote in a burst of compassion during a very dark \ntime in my life:\n\n\nI Pray Tonight\nby Michael R.

They love each other.\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\nAt home once more,\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\nFor she has walked over to me\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\nShe is black and white,\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\nSuddenly I realize\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\nInto blossom.\n\n\n\nWe shall find peace. We shall hear the angels sing. We shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.\nAnton Chekov\n\n\n\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\nby e. e. cummings\n\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\n\n\n\nThe mountain violets have broken the rocks.\nTennessee Williams \n(slightly paraphrased)\n\n\n\nHere are my translations of Cherokee blessings, which I gave to my father when \nhe chose to enter hospice and end his life by refusing dialysis:\n\n\n\nCherokee Travelers\' Blessing I\nloose\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\nI will extract the thorns from your feet.\nFor a little while, let us walk life\'s sun-lit paths together.\nI will love you like my own blood, my dear brother.\nWhen you are disconsolate, I will wipe the tears from your eyes.\nAnd when you are too sad to live, I will put your aching heart to rest.\n\nCherokee Travelers\' Blessing II\ntranslation by Michael R.

Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\n\nShall I Compare Thee to a Summer\'s Day?\nby William Shakespeare\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer\'s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer\'s lease hath all too short a date.\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature\'s changing course untrimmed.\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wand\'rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\'st,\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\n\n\nHeaven-Haven\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\nI have desired to go\nWhere springs not fail,\nTo fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,\nAnd a few lilies blow.\n\nAnd I have asked to be\nWhere no storms come,\nWhere the green swell is in the havens dumb,\nAnd out of the swing of the sea.\n\n\n\nHere\'s poem I wrote for my mother, Christine Ena Burch:\n\n\nMothers Smile\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere never was a fonder smile\nthan mothers smile, no softer touch\nthan mothers touch. So sleep awhile\nand know she loves you more than much.\n\nSo more than much, much more than all.\nThough tender words, these do not speak\nof love at all, nor how we fall\nand mothers there, nor how we reach\nfrom nightmares in the ticking night\nand she is there to hold us tight.\n\nThere never was a stronger back\nthan fathers back, that held our weight\nand lifted us, when we were small,\nand bore us till we reached the gate,\nthen held our hands that first bright mile\ntill we could run, and did, and flew.\nBut, oh, a mothers tender smile\nwill leap and follow after you!\n\n\n\nThe Divine Image\nby William BlakeTo Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nAll pray in their distress;\nAnd to these virtues of delight\nReturn their thankfulness.For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs God, our father dear,\nAnd Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs Man, his child and care.For Mercy has a human heart,\nPity a human face,\nAnd Love, the human form divine,\nAnd Peace, the human dress.Then every man, of every clime,\nThat prays in his distress,\nPrays to the human form divine,\nLove, Mercy, Pity, Peace.And all must love the human form,\nIn heathen, Turk, or Jew;\nWhere Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell\nThere God is dwelling too.\n\n\n\nSee\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSee how her hair has thinned: it doesn\'t seem\nlike hair at all, but like the airy moult\nof emus who outraced the wind and left\nsoft plumage in their wake. See how her eyes\nare gentler now; see how each wrinkle laughs,\nand deepens on itself, as though mirth took\nsome comfort there and burrowed deeply in,\noutlasting winter. See how very thin\nher features arethat time has made more spare,\nso that each bone shows, elegant and rare.\n\nFor loveliness remains in her grave eyes,\nand courage in her still-delighted looks:\neach face presented like a picture book\'s.\nBemused, she blows us undismayed goodbyes.\n\nOriginally published by Writer\'s Digest\'sThe Year\'s Best Writing 2003\n\n\n\n\nHe did not say: You will not be troubled, you will not be belabored, you will \nnot be afflicted; but he said: You will not be overcome.\n~Mother Julian of Norwich\n\nAll shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.\n~Mother Julian of Norwich\n\n\n\nThe 23rd Psalm\nattributed to King David\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures,\nHe leadeth me beside the still waters,\nHe restoreth my soul.\nHe leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\'s sake.\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\nI will fear no evil:\nFor thou art with me.\nThy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,\nand I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\n\n\nAll is well\nby Henry Scott Holland (1847-1918)\nCanon of St. Paul\'s Cathedral\n\nDeath is nothing at all.\nI have only slipped away into the next room.\nI am I, and you are you.\nWhatever we were to each other, that we still are.\nCall me by my old familiar name,\nspeak to me in the easy way which you always used.\nPut no difference in your tone,\nwear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.\nLaugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we enjoyed together.\nPray, smile, think of me, pray for me.\nLet my name be ever the household word that it always was,\nlet it be spoken without effect,\nwithout the trace of a shadow on it.\nLife means all that it ever meant.\nIt is the same as it ever was;\nthere is unbroken continuity.\nWhy should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?\nI am waiting for you,\nfor an interval,\nsomewhere very near,\njust round the corner.\nAll is well.\n\n\n\nSanskrit Proverb\nLook to this day,\nFor yesterday is but a dream,\nAnd tomorrow is only a vision,\nBut today, well lived,\nMakes every yesterday a dream of happiness,\nAnd every tomorrow a vision of hope.\nLook well, therefore, to this day.\n\n\n\nChild of 9-11\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na poem for Christina-Taylor Green, who was born\non September 11, 2001 and died at the age of nine, \nshot to death ...\n\nChild of 9-11, beloved, \nI bring this lily, lay it down\nhere at your feet, and eiderdown,\nand all soft things, for your gentle spirit. \nI bring this psalm  I hope you hear it.\n\nMuch love I bring  I lay it down\nhere by your form, which is not you,\nbut what you left this shell-shocked world\nto help us learn what we must do\nto save another child like you.\n\nChild of 9-11, I know\nyou are not here, but watch, afar\nfrom distant stars, where angels rue\nthe vicious things some mortals do.\nI also watch; I also rue.\n\nAnd so I make this pledge and vow:\nthough I may weep, I will not rest\nnor will my pen fail heaven\'s test\ntill guns and wars and hate are banned\nfrom every shore, from every land.\n\nChild of 9-11, I grieve\nyour tender life, cut short ... bereaved,\nwhat can I do, but pledge my life\nto saving lives like yours? Belief\nin your sweet worth has led me here ...\n\nI give my all: my pen, this tear,\nthis lily and this eiderdown,\nand all soft things my heart can bear;\nI bear them to your final bier,\nand leave them with my promise, here.\n\n\n\nJust Smile\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWed like to think some angel smiling down\nwill watch him as his arm bleeds in the yard,\nripped off by dogs, will guide his tipsy steps,\nhis doddering progress through the scarlet house\nto tell his mommy boo-boo!, only two.\n\nWed like to think his reconstructed face\nwill be as good as new, will often smile,\nthat baseballs just as fun with just one arm,\nthat God is always Just, that girls will smile,\nnot frown down at his thousand livid scars,\nthat Life is always Just, that Love is Just.\n\nWe do not want to hear that he will shave\nat six, to raze the leg hairs from his cheeks,\nthat lips arent easily fashioned, that his smiles\nlopsided, oafish, snaggle-toothed, that each\nnew operation costs a billion tears,\nwhen tears are out of fashion.\n O, beseech\nsome poet with more skill with words than tears\nto find some happy ending, to believe\nthat God is Just, that Love is Just, that these\nare Parables we live, Lifes Mysteries ...\n\nOr look inside his courage, as he ties\nhis shoelaces one-handed, as he throws\nno-hitters on the first-place team, and goes\non dates, looks in the mirror undeceived\nand smiling says, Its me I see. Just me.\n\nHe smiles, if life is Just, or lacking cures.\nYour pity is the worst cut he endures.\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
