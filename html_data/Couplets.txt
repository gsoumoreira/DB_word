Burch \r\n\r\n\r\nLet\'s begin our investigation \r\nof the best couplets in the English language with some\r\nquick definitions and sterling examples ... \r\n\r\nCouplet Definition: Two lines of poetic verse, usually but not always in the \r\nsame meter and of about the same length that are often (but not always) joined by rhyme and form a unit (i.e., that go together and/or stand alone).\r\n\r\nCouplets do not have to rhyme ...\r\n\r\nLightning\r\nshatters the darkness:\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek.\r\nMatsuo Basho, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n... but in formal/traditional English poetry they usually do ...\r\n\r\nRhymed Couplet Examples\r\n\r\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\r\nIn the forests of the night ...\r\nWilliam Blake, The Tyger\r\n\r\nDouble, double, toil and trouble; \r\nFire burn and cauldron bubble.\r\nWilliam Shakespeare, Macbeth\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nbut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\nattributed to Plato, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gulls in their high, lonely circuits may tell.\r\nGlaucus, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere he lies in state tonight: great is his Monument!\r\nYet Ares cares not, neither does War relent.\r\nAnacreon, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBlame not the gale, or the inhospitable sea-gulf, or friends tardiness,\r\nmariner! Just mans foolhardiness.\r\nLeonidas of Tarentum, translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHeroic Couplet Definition: When rhyming couplets are written in iambic \r\npentameter they are called heroic couplets or heroic verse. Especially a stanza consisting of two rhyming lines \r\nof iambic \r\npentameter which form a rhetorical unit and are written in an elevated \r\nstyle, as in the poems of Geoffrey Chaucer and Alexander Pope. Entire longer \r\npoems have been written in heroic couplets, such as Chaucer\'s Canterbury Tales \r\nand Pope\'s The Rape of the Lock, Essay on Man and Essay on Criticism.\r\n\r\nHeroic Couplet Example\r\n\r\nTrue ease in writing comes from art, not chance, \r\nAs those move easiest who have learnd to dance. \r\nAlexander Pope\r\n\r\nBlank Verse Couplet Definition: Two lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter used, \r\nfor example, toward the end of speeches in Christopher Marlowe\'s Tamburlaine. \r\n\r\nBlank Verse Couplet Example\r\n\r\nAnd sooner shall the sun fall from his sphere\r\nThan Tamburlaine be slain or overcome. \r\nChristopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nUnrhymed Couplet Definition: Two lines of poetic verse, usually either blank \r\nverse or free verse, that form a unit but do not rhyme. \r\n\r\nUnrhymed Couplet Example\r\n\r\n... you are whatever a moon has always meant \r\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you ...\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nFree Verse Couplet Example\r\n\r\nI celebrate myself, and sing myself, \r\nAnd what I assume you shall assume ...\r\nWalt Whitman\r\n\r\nClosed Couplet Definition: Two end-stopped lines of verse which form a complete \r\nbounded thought that is logically or grammatically complete, such as a \r\nsentence or independent clause. A closed couplet can stand apart from the rest \r\nof the poem it appears in. \r\n\r\n\r\nComplete Poem Rhymed Couplets\r\n\r\nA couplet can comprise a complete poem, as in the following examples: \r\n\r\nForgive, O Lordby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\nEpigram Engraved on the Collar of a Dog Which I Gave to His Royal \r\nHighness\r\nby Alexander Pope\r\n\r\nI am his highness\'s dog at Kew; \r\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you? \r\n\r\n(Alexander Pope, a poet famous for his satires such as The Dunciad and\r\nThe Rape of the Lock, wrote this epigram in the 1730s and had it \r\nengraved on the collar of one of his puppies, which he gave to Frederick, Prince \r\nof Wales.)\r\n\r\nThe Cow\r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe cow is of the bovine ilk;\r\nOne end is moo, the other, milk.\r\n\r\nPoets\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nPoets aren\'t very useful \r\nBecause they aren\'t consumeful or produceful. \r\nStyx\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBlack waters,\r\ndeep and dark and still . . .\r\nall men have passed this way, or will.\r\n\r\nI wrote the poem above as a teenager in high school. The lines started out as \r\npart of a longer poem, but I thought these were the two best lines and decided \r\nto let them stand alone on the principle that discretion is the better part of \r\nvalor.\r\n\r\nChinese Couplet Definition: Chinese couplets have two lines with\r\nthe same metrical length; the two lines must be contextually related. \r\nFurthermore, the pattern of tones in the first line must be inverted in the \r\nsecond line. Thus, Chinese couplets are similar to \r\nthe chiasmus.  \r\n\r\nChinese Couplet Example\r\n\r\nSea wide allows fish to jump\r\nSky high enables birds to fly\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes\r\n\r\nElegiac Couplet Definition: One hexameter line with six poetic feet, followed by \r\none pentameter line with five poetic feet.\r\nOpen Couplet Definition: A couplet that cannot stand on its own as a complete \r\nthought and thus depends on other parts of the poem in which it appears.\r\nShakespearean sonnets end with a couplet whereas some other sonnet forms do not.\r\n\r\nWhen multiple rhymed couplets appear in a poem they typically have the rhyme scheme AA BB CC DD \r\netc. \r\n\r\nUnrhymed Free Verse Couplets\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI love you as certain dark things are to be loved,\r\nin secret, between the shadow and the soul.\r\nPablo Neruda\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLove calls, everywhere and always.\r\nWe\'re sky bound. \r\nAre you coming?\r\nRumi\r\n\r\n\r\nHaiku and Haiku-Like Poems Recast as Couplets\r\n\r\n\r\nLightning\r\nshatters the darkness:\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek.\r\nMatsuo Basho, loose translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAn ancient pond,\r\nthe frog leaps:\r\nthe silver plop and gurgle of water.\r\n\r\nMatsuo Basho, loose \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn a misty rain a butterfly is riding \r\nthe tail of a cow.\r\nRichard Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\nSappho of Lesbos, loose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho is the first great lyric that poet that we know by name today. The \r\nterm lyric \r\nderives from the lyre, a harp-like musical instrument. Sappho is thus the \r\noriginal singer-songwriter, and the artistic mother not only of lyric poets like \r\nEdmund Spenser, William Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson, but also of singer-songwriters like Woody \r\nGuthrie, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Sam Cooke and Carole King. Basho \r\nis one of the world\'s greatest poets, in my opinion. Richard Wright was one of \r\nthe better Western poets to write haiku.\r\n\r\nVillanelles\r\n\r\nThe Villanelle is a unique form in which two lines repeat, either in whole or in \r\npart, until they combine to form a closing couplet. To make the repetition \r\neasier to see, the repeating lines have been italicized below. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditional Sonnets \r\n\r\nThe traditional English sonnet typically ends with a rhymed couplet that wraps \r\nthings up. The most common English forms of the sonnet are the Spenserian \r\nsonnet (rhyme schemeabab bcbc cdcd ee), the Shakespearean sonnet \r\n(rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg) and the Petrarchan sonnet (rhyme \r\nscheme abba abba cdecde), although there are other variations. \r\n\r\nShakespearean Sonnets (rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg)\r\n\r\nSonnet 147: My Love is as a Fever\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still [a]\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease, [b]\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill, [a]\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please. [b]\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love, [c]\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept, [d]\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve [c]\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except. [d]\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care, [e]\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest. [f]\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are, [e]\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed, [f]\r\nFor I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, [g]\r\nWho art as black as Hell, as dark as night. [g]\r\n\r\nSonnet 73: That Time of Year\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold [a]\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang [b]\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold, [a]\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. [b]\r\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day [c]\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west; [d]\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away, [c]\r\nDeaths second self, that seals up all in rest. [d]\r\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire, [e]\r\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie, [f]\r\nAs the deathbed whereon it must expire, [e]\r\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by. [f]\r\nThis thou perceivst, which makes thy love more strong, [g]\r\nTo love that well which thou must leave ere long. [g]\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art [a]\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night, [b]\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart, [a]\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite, [b]\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task [c]\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores, [d]\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask [c]\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors; [d]\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable, [e]\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast, [f]\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell, [e]\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest, [f]\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath, [g]\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death. [g]\r\n\r\nSpenserian Sonnet (rhyme schemeabab bcbc cdcd ee)\r\n\r\nSonnet LXXV\r\nby Edmund Spenser \r\n\r\nOne day I wrote her name upon the strand, [a]\r\nBut came the waves and washed it away; [b]\r\nAgain I wrote it with a second hand, [a]\r\nBut came the tide and made my pains his prey. [b]\r\nVain man, said she, that dost in vain assay [b]\r\nA mortal thing so to immortalize, [c]\r\nFor I myself shall like to this decay, [b]\r\nAnd eke my name be wiped out likewise [c]\r\nNot so. quod I, Let baser thing devise [c]\r\nTo die in dust, but you shall live by fame; [d]\r\nMy verse your virtues rare shall eternize [c]\r\nAnd in the heavens write your glorious name, [d]\r\nWhere, when as death shall all the world subdue, [e]\r\nOur love shall live, and later life renew. [e]\r\n\r\nPetrarchan Sonnets (rhyme scheme abba abba cdecde/cdcdcd/cddcdd)\r\n\r\nCredo\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nI cannot find my way: there is no star [a]\r\nIn all the shrouded heavens anywhere; [b]\r\nAnd there is not a whisper in the air [b]\r\nOf any living voice but one so far [a]\r\nThat I can hear it only as a bar [a]\r\nOf lost, imperial music, played when fair [b]\r\nAnd angel fingers wove, and unaware, [b]\r\nDead leaves to garlands where no roses are. [a]\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a glimmer, nor a call, [c]\r\nFor one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears, [d]\r\nThe black and awful chaos of the night; [e]\r\nFor through it allabove, beyond it all [c]\r\nI know the far sent message of the years, [d]\r\nI feel the coming glory of the light. [e]\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, [a]\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain [b]\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain [b]\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh [a]\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply, [a]\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain [b]\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again [b]\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry. [a]\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree, [c]\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one, [d]\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before: [e]\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone, [d]\r\nI only know that summer sang in me [c]\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more. [e]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand; [a]\r\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown; [b]\r\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown; [b]\r\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land, [a]\r\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand [a]\r\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known [b]\r\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone [b]\r\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band. [a]\r\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold, [c]\r\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust [d]\r\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old, [c]\r\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust. [d]\r\nTwine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold [c]\r\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust. [d]\r\n\r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind, [a]\r\nBut as for me, alas!, I may no more. [b]\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore, [b]\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind. [a]\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind [a]\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore [b]\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore, [b]\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind. [a]\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt, [c]\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain. [d]\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain [d]\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about: [c]\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am, [d]\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. [d]\r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. In May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly \r\ncommitting adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released from the Tower later that \r\nyear, thanks to his friendship and his father\'s friendship with Thomas Cromwell. But during his stay in the Tower, \r\nWyatt may have \r\nwitnessed the execution of Anne Boleyn from his cell window, and the executions of the five other men with whom she was accused of committing \r\nadultery. A common interpretation of this poem is that the deer (dear) is Anne \r\nBoleyn, and that Caesar is King Henry VIII, who had her and her lovers beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nComposed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802by\r\nWilliam Wordsworth\r\n\r\nEarth has not anything to show more fair: [a]\r\nDull would he be of soul who could pass by [b]\r\nA sight so touching in its majesty: [b]\r\nThis City now doth, like a garment, wear [a]\r\nThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare, [a]\r\nShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie [b]\r\nOpen unto the fields, and to the sky; [b]\r\nAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air. [a]\r\nNever did sun more beautifully steep [c]\r\nIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill; [d]\r\nNe\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! [c]\r\nThe river glideth at his own sweet will: [d]\r\nDear God! the very houses seem asleep; [c]\r\nAnd all that mighty heart is lying still! [d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled [a]\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled. [b]\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled [b]\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world. [a]\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke. [c]\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called. [a]\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled, [a]\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke. [c]\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn [d]\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds, [e]\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained. [f]\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn, [d]\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds, [e]\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained. [f]\r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint [a]\r\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave, [b]\r\n\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave, [b]\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint. [a]\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint [a]\r\n\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save, [b]\r\n\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have [b]\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint, [a]\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind. [c]\r\nHer face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight [d]\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined [c]\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight. [d]\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined, [c]\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night. [d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountain Of Blood\r\n\r\nby Charles Baudelaire, translated by Rachel Hadas\r\n\r\n\r\nA fountain\'s pulsing sobslike this my blood [a]\r\nMeasures its flowing, so it sometimes seems. [b]\r\nI hear a gentle murmur as it streams; [b]\r\nWhere the wound lies I\'ve never understood. [a]\r\n\r\nLike water meadows, boulevards are flooded. [c]\r\nCobblestones, crisscrossed by scarlet rills, [d]\r\nAre islands; creatures come and drink their fill. [d]\r\nNothing in nature now remains unblooded. [c]\r\n\r\nI used to hope that wine could bring me ease, [e]\r\nCould lull asleep my deeply gnawing mind. [f]\r\nI was a fool: the senses clear with wine. [f]\r\n\r\nI looked to Love to cure my old disease. [e]\r\nLove led me to a thicket of IVs [e]\r\nWhere bristling needles thirsted for each vein. [f]\r\n\r\nSpring and Fall, to a Young Child\r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret, are you grieving [a]\r\nOver Goldengrove unleaving? [a]\r\nLeaves, like the things of man, you [b]\r\nWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you? [b]\r\nAh! as the heart grows older [c]\r\nIt will come to such sights colder [c]\r\nBy and by, nor spare a sigh [d]\r\nThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie; [d]\r\nAnd yet you will weep and know why. [d]\r\nNow no matter, child, the name: [e]\r\nSorrow\'s springs are the same. [e]\r\nNor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed [f]\r\nWhat h\xe9art h\xe9ard of, gh\xf3st gu\xe9ssed: [f]\r\nIt is the blight man was born for, [g]\r\nIt is Margaret you mourn for. [g] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda and the Swan\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still [a]\r\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed [b]\r\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, [a]\r\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast. [b]\r\n\r\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push [c]\r\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs? [d]\r\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush, [c]\r\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies? [d]\r\n\r\nA shudder in the loins engenders there [e]\r\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower [f]\r\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\r\n Being so caught up, \r\n[g]\r\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air, [e]\r\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power [f]\r\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop? [g]\r\n\r\nBlank Verse Sonnets and Free Verse Sonnets\r\n\r\nA blank verse sonnet abandons rhyme but maintains iambic meter (ta TUM ta TUM ta \r\nTUM etc.) perhaps with some degree of metrical variation, while a free verse \r\nsonnet does not employ regular meter. \r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nLonger Poems with Strong Closing Couplets\r\n\r\nA couplet can be used to end a longer poem that may, or may not, be \r\nwritten in couplets. \r\n\r\nBarren Woman\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nEmpty, I echo to the least footfall,\r\nMuseum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.\r\nIn my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,\r\nNun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies\r\nExhale their pallor like scent.\r\n\r\nI imagine myself with a great public,\r\nMother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.\r\nInstead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.\r\nThe moon lays a hand on my forehead,\r\nBlank-faced and mum as a nurse.\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nRequiescat is the first word in the Latin prayer Requiescat in pace \r\n(meaning Rest in peace). Oscar \r\nWilde wrote the poem for his beloved sister Isola, who died at age nine. I believe \r\nWilde\'s poem may have been influenced by an elder poet, Robert Herrick ...\r\n\r\nAnother: Upon a Child\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nHere a pretty baby lies\r\nSung asleep with lullabies:\r\nPray be silent, and not stir\r\nTh\' easy earth that covers her.\r\n\r\nRefugee \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThese Strangers, in a foreign World, \r\nProtection asked of me\r\nBefriend them, lest Yourself in Heaven \r\nBe found a Refugee\r\n\r\nThis poem by one of the first great female American poets still speaks \r\neloquently, passionately and powerfully to the modern world. \r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrel Man\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nAnd my throat\r\nIs deep with song,\r\nYou did not think\r\nI suffer after\r\nI\'ve held my pain\r\nSo long.\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nYou do not hear\r\nMy inner cry:\r\nBecause my feet\r\nAre gay with dancing,\r\nYou do not know\r\nI die.\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes was one of the first American poets to create a fusion between \r\nthe blues, jazz and modern poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nmysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. Frye, who had never written a poem before, composed the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t even visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle\r\nby Alfred, Lord Tennyson\r\n\r\nHe clasps the crag with crooked hands;\r\nClose to the sun in lonely lands,\r\nRing\'d with the azure world, he stands.\r\n\r\nThe wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;\r\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\r\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the first poems that really grabbed me when I started reading \r\npoetryvoluntarily at first, soon avidlyas a high school student. Pretty soon, \r\nI was hooked and started writing poems of my own. I included Tennyson\'s The \r\nEagle in my first serious notebook of poems.Michael R. Burch, editor, The HyperTexts\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake may have been the most influential poet/artist of all time. If \r\nyou\'re interested to know why, you can click here:\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake the World\'s Most Influential Poet/Artist. Blake was a mystic \r\nwho said that he communicated with angels and saints on a daily basis. In \r\naddition to being one of England\'s greatest poets, he may have been its greatest \r\npainter and engraver as well. \r\n\r\nIf Bees Are Few\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, \r\nOne clover, and a bee, \r\nAnd revery. \r\nThe revery alone will do, \r\nIf bees are few.\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon ballad, circa 990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nhuge, battle-strong arms grabbed and engulfed me.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s Notes: This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a \r\nwild lament, a lover\'s lament, a passion play, a riddle, a song, or an early \r\nballad (it may be the earliest English poem with a refrain). However, most scholars place it within the genre of the frauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\nextant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage; it seems likely that the poet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of \r\nancient scops pretending to be women. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called \r\nthe first English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and \r\nmocking the man who has been raping and impregnating her. And the poem\'s closing \r\nmetaphor of a loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never \r\nharmonized remains one of the strongest in the English language, or any \r\nlanguage.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n)\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\nLost\r\n\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLost on a fogbound spit of sand\r\nin shoes that pinch me, close at hand\r\nI hear the splash of Charon\'s oar\r\nthat ferries no one to a happy shore.\r\n\r\nThis Be The Verse \r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nThey fuck you up, your mum and dad. \r\nThey may not mean to, but they do. \r\nThey fill you with the faults they had \r\nAnd add some extra, just for you. \r\n\r\nBut they were fucked up in their turn \r\nBy fools in old-style hats and coats, \r\nWho half the time were soppy-stern \r\nAnd half at one another\'s throats. \r\n\r\nMan hands on misery to man. \r\nIt deepens like a coastal shelf. \r\nGet out as early as you can, \r\nAnd don\'t have any kids yourself. \r\n\r\nServitude\r\nby Anne Reeve Aldrich\r\n\r\nThe church was dim at vespers.\r\nMy eyes were on the Rood.\r\nBut yet I felt thee near me,\r\nIn every drop of blood.\r\n\r\nIn helpless, trembling bondage\r\nMy soul\'s weight lies on thee,\r\nO call me not at dead of night,\r\nLest I should come to thee!\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers. Dont cry\r\nthe best gesture of my brain is less than\r\nyour eyelids flutter which says\r\n\r\nwe are for each other: then\r\nlaugh, leaning back in my arms\r\nfor lifes not a paragraph\r\n\r\nAnd death i think is no parenthesis\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCradle Songby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stayby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\nWild Asters\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nIn the spring I asked the daisies\r\n If his words were true,\r\nAnd the clever, clear-eyed daisies\r\n Always knew.\r\n\r\nNow the fields are brown and barren,\r\n Bitter autumn blows,\r\nAnd of all the stupid asters\r\n Not one knows.\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nOn My First Daughter\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nHere lies, to each her parents\' ruth, \r\nMary, the daughter of their youth; \r\nYet all heaven\'s gifts being heaven\'s due, \r\nIt makes the father less to rue.\r\n\r\nAt six months\' end, she parted hence \r\nWith safety of her innocence; \r\nWhose soul heaven\'s queen, whose name she bears, \r\nIn comfort of her mother\'s tears, \r\nHath placed amongst her virgin-train: \r\nWhere, while that severed doth remain, \r\nThis grave partakes the fleshly birth; \r\nWhich cover lightly, gentle earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A.

Tyger! burning bright\r\nIn the forests of the night\r\nWhat immortal hand or eye\r\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\nIn what distant deeps or skies\r\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\r\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\r\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\r\n\r\nAnd what shoulder,  what art,\r\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\r\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\r\nWhat dread hand?  what dread feet?\r\n\r\nWhat the hammer? what the chain?\r\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\r\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp\r\nDare its deadly terrors clasp?\r\n\r\nWhen the stars threw down their spears,\r\nAnd water\'d heaven with their tears,\r\nDid he smile his work to see?\r\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\r\n\r\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\r\nIn the forests of the night,\r\nWhat immortal hand or eye\r\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose\r\nby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving\r\nby George Gordon, Lord \r\nByron\r\n\r\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\nSo late into the night,\r\nThough the heart be still as loving,\r\nAnd the moon be still as bright.\r\n\r\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\r\nAnd the soul outwears the breast,\r\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\r\nAnd love itself have rest.\r\n\r\nThough the night was made for loving,\r\nAnd the day returns too soon,\r\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\nBy the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\r\nby T.

Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive \r\npigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\r\nAplolgia Pro Vita Sua\r\n\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nThe poet in his lone yet genial hour\r\nGives to his eyes a magnifying power:\r\nOr rather he emancipates his eyes\r\nFrom the black shapeless accidents of size\r\nIn unctuous cones of kindling coal,\r\nOr smoke upwreathing from the pipe\'s trim bole,\r\n His gifted ken can see\r\n Phantoms of sublimity.\r\n\r\nTo Helen \r\nby Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\nHelen, thy beauty is to me\r\nLike those Nicean barks of yore,\r\nThat gently, o\'er a perfumed sea,\r\nThe weary, wayworn wanderer bore\r\nTo his own native shore.\r\n\r\nOn desperate seas long wont to roam,\r\nThy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,\r\nThy Naiad airs have brought me home\r\nTo the glory that was Greece\r\nAnd the grandeur that was Rome.\r\n\r\nLo! in yon brilliant window-niche\r\nHow statue-like I see thee stand,\r\nThe agate lamp within thy hand!\r\nAh, Psyche, from the regions which\r\nAre Holy Land!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tDream Variations\r\n\t\r\n\tby Langston Hughes\r\nTo fling my arms wide\r\nIn some place of the sun,\r\nTo whirl and to dance\r\nTill the white day is done.\r\nThen rest at cool evening\r\nBeneath a tall tree\r\nWhile night comes on gently,\r\nDark like me\r\nThat is my dream!\r\nTo fling my arms wide\r\nIn the face of the sun,\r\nDance! Whirl! Whirl!\r\nTill the quick day is done.\r\nRest at pale evening . . .\r\nA tall, slim tree . . .\r\nNight coming tenderly\r\nBlack like me.\r\n\r\nWho ever loved\r\nby Christopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is overruled by fate.\r\nWhen two are stripped, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should love, the other win;\r\n\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows; let it suffice\r\nWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever loved, that loved not at first sight?\r\n\r\nWe Wear the Mask\r\nby Paul Laurence Dunbar\r\n\r\nWe wear the mask that grins and lies,\r\nIt hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,\r\nThis debt we pay to human guile;\r\nWith torn and bleeding hearts we smile,\r\nAnd mouth with myriad subtleties.\r\n\r\nWhy should the world be overwise,\r\nIn counting all our tears and sighs?\r\nNay, let them only see us, while\r\nWe wear the mask.\r\n\r\nWe smile, but, O great Christ, our cries\r\nTo thee from tortured souls arise.\r\nWe sing, but oh the clay is vile\r\nBeneath our feet, and long the mile;\r\nBut let the world dream otherwise,\r\nWe wear the mask!\r\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best couplets ever, according to me. I\'m sure every \r\nreader\'s choices will be different, but if you added a poem or three to yours, \r\nhaving read mine, hopefully you will consider your time here well spent.\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Best Sonnets,\r\nThe Best Villanelles,\r\nThe Best Sestinas,\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels,\r\n\r\nThe Best Kyrielles,\r\nThe Best Couplets,\r\nThe Best Haiku,\r\n\r\nThe Best Poem of All Time,\r\n\r\nThe Best Limericks,\r\n\r\nThe Best Nonsense Verse,\r\n\r\nThe Best \r\nLight Verse,\r\nThe Best Poems Ever Written, \r\nThe Best Poets,\r\nThe Best of the Masters,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Poems in the English Language,\r\nThe Most Popular Poems of All Time,\r\nThe Best American Poetry,\r\nThe Best Poetry Translations,\r\nThe Best Ancient Greek Epigrams and Epitaphs,\r\nThe Best Anglo-Saxon Riddles and Kennings,\r\nThe Best Old English Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Lyric Poetry,\r\nThe Best Free Verse, \r\nThe Best Story Poems,\r\nThe Best Narrative Poems,\r\nThe Best Epic Poems,\r\nThe Best Epigrams,\r\nThe Best Poems for Kids,\r\n\r\nThe Most Beautiful Lines in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Quatrains Ever,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Sonnets in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments,\r\nThe Best Holocaust Poetry,\r\nThe Best Hiroshima Poetry,\r\nThe Best Anti-War Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Religious Poetry,\r\nThe Best Spiritual Poetry, \r\nThe Best Heretical Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Thanksgiving Poems,\r\nThe Best Autumnal Poems,\r\nThe Best Fall/Autumn Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Vampire Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Love Poems,\r\nThe Best Urdu Love Poetry, \r\nThe Best Erotic Poems,\r\nThe Best Romantic Poetry,\r\nThe Best Love Songs Ever,\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Movies of All Time,\r\nVisions of Beauty,\r\nThe Best Poems about Death and Loss,\r\nWhat is \r\nPoetry?, \r\nThe Best Antinatalist Poems and Prose,\r\nEngland\'s Greatest Artists\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
