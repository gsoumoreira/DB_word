Its purpose is to present poems about the Holocaust and give \r\nbackground information about the poets and the horrifying circumstances under which their \r\npoems were written. The Hebrew word for the Holocaust is Shoah (Catastrophe); \r\nthus poems written by Jewish Holocaust poets may also be called Shoah poetry. We \r\nhave also published Holocaust writings by Germans who opposed the Nazis, a \r\nRomani Gypsy, an Estonian, even Pope John Paul II. You can also find an extensive \r\nindex of writings by victims and survivors of the Holocaust below, along with \r\npoems that oppose racism, intolerance, war, genocide and ethnic cleansing. The \r\npoems and essays that follow include the Holocaust-related writings of\r\nMikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti, Martin Niem\xf6ller,\r\nBertolt Brecht, \r\nPaul Celan, \r\nAnita Dorn,\r\nPrimo Levi, \r\nChaya Feldman, Anthony Hecht, \r\n\r\nBer Horvitz, Mary Elizabeth Frye, Carl Sandburg,\r\nAlbert Einstein, \r\nElie Wiesel, Czeslaw Milosz, \r\nMargaret \r\nAtwood,\r\nJanusz Korczak,\r\nJerzy Ficowski,\r\nYala Korwin, Samuel Menashe, \r\n\r\nChaim Nachman Bialik,\r\nWladyslaw Szlengel \r\nand\r\nBronislawa Wajs.\r\n\r\nintro by Michael R. Burch, editor, The HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Auschwitz now the reddening sunset settles;\r\nthey sleep alikediminutive and tall,\r\nthe innocent, the surgeons.\r\n Sleeping, all ...\r\n\r\nThe poem Auschwitz Rose is dedicated to all \r\nvictims and survivors of the Holocaust. To read the full poem, please click the picture above. In Mary Rae\'s painting, the Rose is thornless, \r\nrepresenting women and children who are defenseless unless we choose to protect them. As we read the Witnesses who follow, let\'s all \r\nsay Never again! and pledge to protect all women and all children from all such atrocities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most famous Holocaust poem of all time, First They Came for the Jews, was written by Martin Niem\xf6ller, a Lutheran pastor and \r\ntheologian who was born in Germany in 1892. At one time a supporter of Hitlers policies, he eventually \r\nrecanted and as a result \r\nwas arrested and confined to the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps from 1938 to 1945. After narrowly avoiding execution at the \r\nhands of the Nazis, he was liberated by the Allies in 1945 and continued his career in Germany as a clergyman, pacifist and anti-war activist.\r\n\r\nFirst They Came For The Jews\r\nby Martin Niem\xf6ller\r\n\r\nFirst they came for the Jews\r\nand I did not speak out\r\nbecause I was not a Jew.\r\n\r\nThen they came for the Communists\r\nand I did not speak out\r\nbecause I was not a Communist.\r\n\r\nThen they came for the trade unionists\r\nand I did not speak out\r\nbecause I was not a trade unionist.\r\n\r\nThen they came for me\r\nand there was no one left\r\nto speak out for me.\r\n\r\nMikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti [1909-1944], a Hungarian Jew and a fierce anti-fascist, is perhaps the greatest of the Holocaust poets. He was born in Budapest \r\nin 1909. In 1930, at the age of 21, he published his first collection of poems, Pog\xe1ny k\xf6sz\xf6nto (Pagan Salute). His next book, \xdajm\xf3di \r\np\xe1sztorok \xe9neke (Modern Shepherd\'s Song) was confiscated on grounds of "indecency," earning him a light jail sentence. In 1931 he spent two \r\nmonths in Paris, where he visited the Exposition coloniale and began translating African poems and folk tales into Hungarian. In \r\n1934 he obtained his Ph.D. in Hungarian literature. The following year he married Fanni (Fifi) Gyarmati; they settled in Budapest. His book \r\nJ\xe1rk\xe1lj csa, hal\xe1lra\xedt\xe9lt! (Walk On, Condemned!) won the prestigious Baumgarten Prize in 1937. Also in 1937 he wrote his Cartes \r\nPostales (Postcards from France), which were precurors to his darker images of war, Razglednicas (Picture Postcards). During World \r\nWar II, Radn\xf3ti published translations of Virgil, Rimbaud, Mallarm\xe9, Eluard, Apollinare and Blaise Cendras in Orpheus nyom\xe1ban. From \r\n1940 on, he was forced to serve on forced labor battalions, at times arming and disarming explosives on the Ukrainian front. In 1944 he was \r\ndeported to a compulsory labor camp near Bor, Yugoslavia. As the Nazis retreated from the approaching Russian army, the Bor concentration \r\ncamp was evacuated and its internees were led on a forced march through Yugoslavia and Hungary. During what became his death march, Radn\xf3ti \r\nrecorded poetic images of what he saw and experienced. After writing his fourth and final "Postcard," Radn\xf3ti was badly beaten by a soldier \r\nannoyed by his scribblings. Soon thereafter, the weakened poet was shot to death, on November 9, 1944, along with 21 other prisoners who unable \r\nto walk. Their mass grave was exhumed after the war and Radn\xf3ti\'s poems were found on his body by his wife, inscribed in pencil in a small \r\nSerbian exercise book. Radn\xf3ti\'s posthumous collection, Tajt\xe9kos \xe9g (Clouded Sky, or Foaming Sky) contains odes to his wife, letters, \r\npoetic fragments and his final Postcards. Unlike his murderers, Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti never lost his humanity, and his empathy continues to live on \r\nand shine through his work.\r\n\r\nPostcard 1\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten August 30, 1944\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOut of Bulgaria, the great wild roar of the artillery thunders,\r\nresounds on the mountain ridges, rebounds, then ebbs into silence\r\nwhile here men, beasts, wagons and imagination all steadily increase;\r\nthe road whinnies and bucks, neighing; the maned sky gallops;\r\nand you are eternally with me, love, constant amid all the chaos,\r\nglowing within my conscience  incandescent, intense.\r\nSomewhere within me, dear, you abide forever \r\nstill, motionless, mute, like an angel stunned to silence by death\r\nor a beetle hiding in the heart of a rotting tree.\r\n\r\nPostcard 2\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten October 6, 1944 near Crvenka, Serbia\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA few miles away they\'re incinerating\r\nthe haystacks and the houses,\r\nwhile squatting here on the fringe of this pleasant meadow,\r\nthe shell-shocked peasants quietly smoke their pipes.\r\nNow, here, stepping into this still pond, the little shepherd girl\r\nsets the silver water a-ripple\r\nwhile, leaning over to drink, her flocculent sheep\r\nseem to swim like drifting clouds.\r\n\r\nPostcard 3\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nwritten October 24, 1944 near Moh\xe1cs, Hungary\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe oxen dribble bloody spittle;\r\nthe\r\nmen pass blood in their piss.\r\nOur stinking regiment halts, a horde of perspiring savages,\r\nadding our aroma to death\'s repulsive stench.\r\n\r\nPostcard 4\r\nby Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti\r\nhis final poem, written October 31, 1944 near Szentkir\xe1lyszabadja, Hungary\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI toppled beside him  his body already taut,\r\ntight as a string just before it snaps,\r\nshot in the back of the head.\r\n"This is how youll end too; just lie quietly here,"\r\nI whispered to myself, patience blossoming from dread.\r\n"Der springt noch auf, the voice above me jeered;\r\nI could only dimly hear\r\nthrough the congealing blood slowly sealing my ear.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s note:\r\n"Der springt noch auf" means something like "That one is still twitching."\r\n\r\nFor many years now I have been editing, publishing and translating Holocaust poetry. In my opinion Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti is the \r\ngreatest of the Holocaust poets. But this truly great poet became a victim of ethic cleansing, genocide and war. Unfortunately, ethnic \r\ncleansing, genocide and war still continue to this day. If you are a student, teacher, educator, peace activist or just someone who cares and \r\nwants to help, please consider doing everything you can to help end such atrocities forever. Doing all you can will help make the world a safer, happier \r\nplace for people of all races and creeds.\r\n\r\nIt seems the fourth and final Postcard poem above was the last poem written by Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti. Here are some additional biographic notes, \r\nprovided by two of his translators, Peter Czipott and John Ridland: "In a small cross-ruled notebook, procured during his labor in Bor, Serbia, \r\nhe continued to write poems. As the Allies approached the mine where he was interned, he and his brigade were led on a forced march toward \r\nnorthwest Hungary. Laborers who straggledfrom illness, injury or exhaustionwere shot by the roadside and buried in mass graves. \r\nNumber 4 of the Razglednicak poems was written on October 31, the day that Radn\xf3ti\'s friend, the violinist Mikl\xf3s Lovsi, suffered \r\nthat fate. It is the last poem Radn\xf3ti wrote. On November 9, 1944, near the village of Abda, he too was shot on the roadside by guards who were \r\nanxious to reach their camp by nightfall. Buried in a mass grave, his body was exhumed over a year later, and the coroner\'s report mentions \r\nfinding the Bor Notebook in the back pocket of his trousers. Radn\xf3ti had made fair copies of all but five poems while in Bor, and \r\nthose had been smuggled out by a survivor. When his widow Fanni received the notebook, most of the poems had been rendered illegible, saturated \r\nby the liquids of decaying flesh. However, the only poems not smuggled outthe four Razglednicas and one otherhappened to be the only \r\nones still decipherable in their entirety in the notebook. In late summer 1937, Radn\xf3ti had made his second visit to France, accompanied \r\nby Fanni. Although this was a year before Kristallnacht, Hitler\'s move into Czechoslovakia, and the first discriminatory Jewish Law \r\nin Hungary, there was plenty of terrible news in the papers, as mentioned in Place de Notre Dame: the Spanish Civil \r\nWar, the Japanese invasion of China, and of course the increasing threats from Hitler\'s Germany. Nevertheless, most of these poems, at \r\nleast on the surface, are innocent snapshots that justify their French title, referring to picture postcards such as tourists mail home. \r\nRadn\xf3ti was likely alluding ironically to this earlier set with his final four poems, which have the Serbian word for postcardin a Hungarian \r\nplural formas their title. Reading the two sets together darkens the tones of the five earlier poems, and makes the later four all the more \r\npoignant."\r\n\r\nAs Camille Martin wrote, "These last poems, written under the pressure of the most degrading and desperate \r\ncircumstances imaginable, unfurl visions of delicate pastoral beauty next to images of extreme degradation and wild, filthy despair. They give \r\nvoice to the last vestiges of hope, as Radn\xf3ti fantasizes being home once more with his beloved Fanny, as well as to the grim premonition of \r\nhis own fate. This impossibly stark contrast blossoms into paradox: Radn\xf3tis poetry embraces humanity and inhumanity with an urgent desire to \r\nbear witness to both. Yet even at the moment when he is most certain of his imminent death, he never abandons the condensed and intricate \r\nlanguage of his poetry. And pushed to the limits of human endurance and sanity, he never loses his capacity for empathy."\r\nSpeechless\r\nby Ko Un\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nAt Auschwitz\r\npiles of glasses\r\nmountains of shoes\r\nreturning, we stared out different windows.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most powerful and disturbing Holocaust poems ...\r\n\r\nDeath Fugue\r\nby Paul Celan\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nBlack milk of daybreak, we drink you come dusk;\r\nwe drink you come midday, come morning, come night;\r\nwe drink you and drink you.\r\nWere digging a grave like a hole in the sky; \r\ntheres sufficient room to lie there.\r\nThe man of the house plays with vipers; he writes\r\nin the Teutonic darkness, Your golden hair Margarete ...\r\nHe composes by starlight, whistles hounds to stand by,\r\nwhistles Jews to dig graves, where together theyll lie.\r\nHe commands us to strike up bright tunes for the dance! \r\nBlack milk of daybreak, we drink you come dusk;\r\nwe drink you come dawn, come midday, come night;\r\nwe drink you and drink you.\r\nThe man of the house plays with serpents; he writes ...\r\nhe writes as the night falls, Your golden hair Margarete ...\r\nYour ashen hair Shulamith ... \r\nWe are digging dark graves where theres more room, on high.\r\nHis screams, Hey you, dig there! and Hey you, sing and dance! \r\nHe grabs his black nightstick, his eyes pallid blue,\r\nscreaming, Hey youdig deeper! You otherssing, dance! \r\nBlack milk of daybreak, we drink you come dusk;\r\nwe drink you come midday, come morning, come night;\r\nwe drink you and drink you.\r\nThe man of the house writes, Your golden hair Margarete ...\r\nYour ashen hair Shulamith ... as he cultivates snakes.\r\nHe screams, Play Death more sweetly! Deaths the master of Germany!\r\nHe cries, Scrape those dark strings, soon like black smoke youll rise\r\nto your graves in the skies; theres sufficient room for Jews there! \r\nBlack milk of daybreak, we drink you come midnight;\r\nwe drink you come midday; Deaths the master of Germany!\r\nWe drink you come dusk; we drink you and drink you ...\r\nHes a master of Death, his pale eyes deathly blue.\r\nHe fires leaden slugs, his aim level and true.\r\nHe writes as the night falls, Your golden hair Margarete ...\r\nHe unleashes his hounds, grants us graves in the skies.\r\nHe plays with his serpents; Deaths the master of Germany ... \r\nYour golden hair Margarete ...\r\nyour ashen hair Shulamith ...\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep is a Holocaust poem and elegy with a very \r\ninteresting genesis, written \r\nin 1932 by Mary Elizabeth Frye (1905-2004). Although the origin of the poem was disputed \r\nfor some time, Mary Frye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after research by Abigail Van Buren, \r\nthe newspaper columnist better known as "Dear Abby." The version below was published by \r\nThe Times and The Sunday Times in \r\nFrye\'s obituary on November 5, 2004. Frye wrote the poem in 1932. As far as we know, she \r\nhad never written any poetry before, but the plight of a young German Jewish woman, \r\nMargaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband at the time, inspired the \r\npoem. Schwarzkopf had \r\nbeen concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, but she had been warned \r\nnot to return because of increasing anti-Semitic unrest that was erupting into \r\nwhat later became known as the Holocaust. \r\nWhen her mother \r\ndied, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to \r\nstand by my mother\'s grave and shed a tear. Frye found herself composing a \r\npiece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words \r\njust came to her and expressed what she felt about life and death. \r\n\r\n\r\nNinety-Three Daughters of Israel  \na Holocaust poem\nby Chaya Feldman\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe washed our bodies\nand cleansed ourselves;\nwe purified our souls\nand became clean.\n\nDeath does not terrify us;\nwe are ready to confront him.\n\nWhile alive we served God\nand now we can best serve our people\nby refusing to be taken prisoner.\n\nWe have made a covenant of the heart,\nall ninety-three of us;\ntogether we lived and learned,\nand now together we choose to depart.\n\nThe hour is upon us\nas I write these words;\nthere is\nbarely enough time to transcribe this prayer ...\n\nBrethren, wherever you may be,\nhonor the Torah we lived by\nand the Psalms we loved.\n\nRead them for us, as well as for yourselves,\nand someday when the Beast\nhas devoured his last prey,\nwe hope someone will say Kaddish for us:\nwe\nninety-three daughters of Israel. \n\nAmen\n\n\nIn 1943 Meir Shenkolevsky, the secretary of the world Bais Yaakov movement and a \nmember of the Central Committee of Agudas Israel in New York, received a letter \nfrom Chaya Feldman: "I don\'t know when you will \nget this letter and if you still will remember me. When this letter arrives, I \nwill no longer be alive. In a few hours, everything will be past. We are here in \nfour rooms, 93 girls ages 14 to 22, all of us Bais Yaakov teachers. On July 27, \nGestapo agents came, took us out of our apartment and threw us into a dark room. \nWe only have water to drink. The younger girls are very frightened, but I comfort \nthem that in a short while, we will be together with our mother Sara [Sara Shnirer, the founder of the Bais Yaakov Seminary]. Yesterday they took us out, \nwashed us and took all our clothes. They left us only shirts and said that \ntoday, German soldiers will come to visit us. We all swore to ourselves that we \nwill die together. The Germans don\'t know that the bath they gave us was the \nimmersion before our deaths: we all prepared poison. When the soldiers come, we \nwill drink the poison. We are all saying Viduy throughout the day. We are not \nafraid of anything. We only have one request from you: Say Kaddish for 93 bnos \nYisroel! Soon we will be with our mother Sara. Signed, Chaya Feldman from \nCracow."\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep,\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft star-shine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry,\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nCarl Sandburg is one of America\'s best-known penners of free verse. \r\nHere grass may refer to Walt Whitman\'s Leaves of Grass, in which the \r\nfirst great American free verse poet suggests that, if we want to find him after his \r\ndeath, we can look for him under our boot soles!\r\n\r\nGrass\r\n\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\nPile the bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. \r\nShovel them under and let me work\r\nI am the grass; I cover all.\r\n\r\nAnd pile them high at Gettysburg\r\nAnd pile them high at Ypres and Verdun.\r\nShovel them under and let me work.\r\nTwo years, ten years, and the passengers ask the conductor:\r\nWhat place is this?\r\nWhere are we now?\r\n\r\nI am the grass.\r\nLet me work. \r\n\r\nPity Us\r\nby Samuel Menashe\r\n\r\nPity us\r\nBeside the sea\r\nOn the sands\r\nSo briefly\r\n\r\nO Lady\r\nby Samuel Menashe\r\n\r\nO Lady lonely as a stone\r\nEven here moss has grown\r\n\r\nSurvival \r\nby Samuel Menashe\r\n\r\nI stand on this stump\r\nTo knock on wood\r\nFor the good I once\r\nMisunderstood\r\n\r\nCut down, yes\r\nBut rooted still\r\nWhat stumps compress\r\nNo axe can kill\r\n\r\nDaily Bread\r\nby Samuel Menashe\r\n\r\nI knead the dough \r\nWhose oven you stoke \r\nWe consume each loaf \r\nWrapped in smoke \r\n\r\nThe Family Silver \r\nby Samuel Menashe\r\n\r\nThat spoon fell out \r\nOf my mother\'s mouth \r\nBefore I was born, \r\nBut I was endowed \r\nWith a tuning fork \r\n\r\nSamuel Menashe was born Samuel Menashe Weisberg, the child of persecuted Ukrainian Jews who \r\nemigrated to \r\nNew York, living in Brooklyn and Queens. His first language was Yiddish. Menashe served in the military during World War II, \r\nwhere he experienced and survived brutal combat, including the Battle of the Bulge, \r\nwhich affected his worldview forever: For the first few years after the war, \r\neach day was the last day. And then it changed. Each day was the only day. I\'m not sure if \r\nall the poems above are specifically about the Holocaust, per se, but I think \r\nthey serve well whatever their roots. \r\n\r\nSomething\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the children of the Holocaust and the Nakba\r\n\r\nSomething inescapable is lost\r\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\r\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\r\nimmeasurable and void.\r\n\r\nSomething uncapturable is gone\r\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\r\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\r\nand remembrance.\r\n\r\nSomething unforgettable is past\r\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\r\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\r\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary cruelty and brutality are horrible enough, but when \r\ninnocent children are the victims, words begin to fail us. The poem Something tries to capture something of the heartbreaking loss of young \r\nlives cut short, even as the poet admits his inability to do anything more than preserve a \r\nbrief flicker of remembrance, an increasingly ethereal memory. What happened to millions of children during \r\nthe Holocaust was a horror beyond imagining. Children who had been born wrong \r\naccording to the Naziswhether Jewish, Polish, Gypsy, Slavic, Russian or otherwise \r\ninferiorwere either killed outright or stripped of their human rights and \r\nconsigned to abysmal conditions in concentration camps and walled ghettoes. But \r\nas the poem below points out, even to this day completely innocent \r\nchildren continue to be stripped of their human rights and consigned to \r\nabysmal, terrifying conditions in refugee camps \r\nand walled ghettoes, while the world watches and does little or nothing \r\nto help them.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Christian, or have an interest in such things, you may want to read\r\nDid a \r\nMisinterpretation of the Bible lead to the Trail of Tears, American Slavery and \r\nthe Holocaust? \r\n\r\nEpitaph for a Child of the Nakba\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word for the Holocaust is Shoah; it means Catastrophe. The Arabic \r\nword Nakba also means Catastrophe. Today millions of completely innocent \r\nPalestinian children and their mothers and grandparents languish within the walled ghetto of Gaza, the walled \r\nbantustans of Occupied Palestine (the West Bank) and refugee camps across the \r\nMiddle East. Why are people who are obviously not terrorists being \r\ncollectively punished for the crime of having been born wrong, just as Jews were once collectively punished by the Nazis? If it concerns you that such things continue to happen today, \r\nand in this case are being funded and supported by the government of the United \r\nStates, please visit our \r\nNakba Index and read what great humanitarians and Nobel Peace Prize winners \r\nlike Albert Einstein, Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Jimmy \r\nCarter have said on the subject. The most \r\nadmired Jewish intellectual of all time, the man most responsible for the advent \r\nof modern nonviolent resistance, the two men best known for ending South African \r\napartheid, and the president who helped negotiate peace between Israel and \r\nPalestinians have all spoken firmly and eloquently against the racism and \r\ninjustices that resulted in this new catastrophe, \r\nthe Nakba.\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers.\r\n\r\nCleansings\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWalk here among the walking specters. Learn\r\ninhuman patience. Flesh can only cleave\r\nto bone this tightly if their hearts believe\r\nthat God is good, and never mind the Urn.\r\n\r\nA lentil and a bean might plump their skin\r\nwith mothers bounteous, soft-dimpled fat\r\n(and call it health), might quickly build again\r\nthe muscles of dead menfolk. Dream, like that,\r\n\r\nand call it courage. Cry, and be deceived,\r\nand so endure. Or burn, made wholly pure.\r\nOnes prayer is answered,\r\n god thus unbelieved.\r\n\r\nNo holy pyre thisdeaths hissing chamber.\r\nTwo thousand years agoa starlit manger,\r\nweird Herods cries for vengeance on the meek,\r\nthe children slaughtered. Fear, when angels speak,\r\n\r\nthe prophesies of man.\r\n  Do what you "can,"\r\nnot what you must, or should.\r\n  They call you good,\r\n\r\ndead eyes devoid of tears; how shall they speak\r\nexcept in blankness? Fear, then, how they weep.\r\nEscape the gentle clutching stickfolk. Creep\r\naway in shame to retch and flush away\r\n\r\nyour vomit from their ashes. Learn to pray.\r\n\r\nOther Holocaust Poets\r\n\r\nJewish ghetto poets who wrote Holocaust poems include\r\n\r\nHershele Danielovitch, Mordecai Gebirtig, Hirsh Glik, Chaim Grade, Ber \r\nHorowitz, Shmerke Kaczerginski, Chaim Kaplan, Itzhak Katzenelson,\r\nMoishe (Moshe) Kaufman,\r\n\r\nJanusz Korczak, Henryka azowert\xf3wna,\r\nKalman Lis, \r\nItzik Manger,\r\nPeretz\r\nOpochinski, Simkha-Bunim Shayevitch, Yisroel Shtern, Isaiah Spiegel, Abraham \r\nSutzkever,\r\n\r\nWladyslaw Szlengel,\r\nMiryam \r\n(Miriam) Ulinover,\r\nItzhak (Yitzkhak) Viner \r\nand Leyzer Volf, among others. Unfortunately in other cases the poems survived \r\nbut the poets and their names did not.\r\n\r\nPoets, songwriters and bands who opposed racism, fascism and horrors like \r\nthe Holocaust include Joan Baez, William Blake, Robert Burns, Jimmy Cliff, Sam \r\nCooke (A Change is Gonna Come), Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye, Woody Guthrie (who \r\ninscribed This machine kills fascists on his guitar), George Harrison, Joe \r\nHill, Billie Holliday (Strange Fruit), Langston Hughes, Janis Ian, Michael \r\nJackson (Man in the Mirror), Billy Joel (Saigon), Dr. Martin Luther King \r\nJr., Paul McCartney, Robinson Jeffers, John Lennon (who wrote Imagine and \r\nRevolution), Melanie Safka, Phil Ochs, Midnight Oil (Beds Are Burning), Paul \r\nRobeson, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Sly  the Family Stone, Bruce Springsteen, \r\nEdwin Starr (War), Cat Stevens (Peace Train), Sting (Russians), U2, Tom \r\nWaits, Walt Whitman, Stevie Wonder and Neil Young (Let\'s Impeach the \r\nPresident)\r\n\r\nHolocaust Poetry, Testimonies and Essays by Holocaust Victims and Survivors, \r\nand Great Humanitarians \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiklos Radnoti \r\n(translations of a Hungarian Jewish poet; perhaps the greatest of the Holocaust \r\npoets)\r\nTerez\xedn Children\'s Holocaust Poems \r\n(poems by child poets of a Nazi concentration camp)\r\nMartin Niem\xf6ller (he \r\nwrote the most famous of all Holocaust poems: First they came for the \r\nJews ...)\r\n\r\nEinstein \r\non Palestine\r\n\r\n(Albert Einstein was both a victim and survivor of the \r\nHolocaust)\r\nMahmoud Darwish \r\n(the preeminent Palestinian Holocaust poet of his day)\r\n\r\nKarol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) (poetry by Pope John \r\nPaul II, a Holocaust victim and survivor)\r\nPaul Celan \r\n(translations of a German Jewish poet, including his famous poem Todesfuge \r\nor Death Fugue)\r\nThe Ghetto \r\nPoets (translations of Polish Jewish ghetto poets by Yala Korwin)\r\n\r\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. (revisit the ringing words of the man whose \r\nimpossible dream of equality became a reality)\r\n\r\nMohandas Gandhi (please read and consider what the great advocate of non-violent \r\nresistance had to say about the Nakba)\r\n\r\nAs you explore these pages, please keep in mind that if Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, \r\nhomosexuals and other people deemed inferior by the Nazis had not been denied \r\naccess to fair laws and courts, the Holocaust could never have happened. The Holocaust was, essentially, a \r\nfailure of justice that led to the disintegration of the moral foundations of \r\nsociety. In order to prevent other Holocausts, we must ensure that every \r\nchild is protected by fair laws and courts. There can be no \r\nexceptions, because every exception begins life as a \r\ndefenseless \r\nbaby. And so please pay particular attention to our\r\nNakba pages, because \r\nwhile the Nazi Holocaust has thankfully ended, multitudes of innocent \r\nchildren are now suffering and dying in this new Holocaust. \r\nNow is the time to ensure that all  \r\nchildren are protected by equal rights, fair laws and fair courts. Then we can \r\nwrite celebratory poetry, rather than mournful laments and dirges.\r\n\r\n\r\nReuven Moskovitz (a Jewish Holocaust survivor who received the Mount Zion \r\nAward and the Aachen Peace Prize)\r\nBertolt Brecht \r\n(a German poet who opposed the Nazis)\r\nAvraham Burg: the \r\nProphet-Poet of Judaism (Holocaust writings by a Jewish politician and peace \r\nactivist)\r\n\r\nDahlia Ravikovitch (Holocaust poetry by one of Israel\'s foremost poets)\r\n\r\nWhat I learned from Elie Wiesel and other Jewish Holocaust Survivors (an essay by Michael R.
