We \r\ndedicate this page to the children of Gaza and their families; they are \r\nunconvicted inmates of the world\'s largest walled ghetto and prison. Refugees of Israel\'s relentless\r\nhome demolitions, apartheid and\r\nethnic cleansing, they have been denied basic human rights, dignity, freedom and justice for more than sixty \r\nyears. Nor should we ever forget the Palestinian children who live under a \r\nbrutal, racist military occupation in the West Bank that is funded by American \r\ntaxpayer dollars.Michael R. Burch, an editor of Holocaust and Nakba poetry\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to be a sponsor of\r\n\r\n\r\nVoice of Gaza, \r\na school for gifted Palestinian writers who live in Gaza. \r\nWe \r\nhope you will donate to this very worthy cause \r\nby clicking the hyperlinked name \r\nof the school.  \r\n\r\nWe call on everyone who believes in equality and justice for all people to \r\nsupport the Palestinian people in their quest to obtain equality and justice. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRelated pages: \r\n\r\nNakba Poems,\r\nGaza \r\nPoems, The \r\nChildren of Gaza: a Musical, Holocaust Poems,\r\nDarfur \r\nPoems,\r\n\r\nHaiti Poems, Hiroshima \r\nPoems,\r\n\r\n9-11 Poems,\r\nTrail \r\nof Tears Poems, \r\nSandy Hook Poems, Aurora Poetry,\r\nColumbine Poems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur prayers are with the children of Gaza who suffered and died \r\nduring Israel\'s Operation Cast Lead and Operation Pillar of Fire (also known \r\neuphemistically as Pillar of Clouds and Pillar of Defense). I was communicating with a young Gazan \r\ngirl during the early stages of Operation Pillar of Fire and she became so \r\nterrified of the thunderous explosions that she was unable to speak. \r\nIsrael\'s Pillar of Fire left Gaza in flames, and many babies and children \r\ncharred corpses. Now Israel\'s latest offensive, dubbed Operation Protective \r\nEdge or Defensive Edge, threatens Gaza with more collective punishment, carnage, suffering and \r\ndeath. More than half of Gaza\'s 1.8 \r\nmillion residents are children, so military operations there are bound to end in \r\nthe deaths of innocents.\r\n\r\nPalestinian poets and other Arab poets of the Nakba include Taha Muhammad Ali, \r\nHanan Ashrawi, Mourid Barghouti, Mahmoud Darwish (called the Poet Laureate of \r\nthe Palestinians), Najwan Darwish, Khalil Gibran, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, Fady \r\nJoudah, Walid Khazindar, Kamal Nasser (known as The Conscience), Khaled \r\nNusseibeh, Naomi Shihab Nye, Abu Salma, Edmon Shehadeh, Iqbal Tamimi, Daud Turki, \r\nIbrahim Tuqan, Fadwa Tuqan (known as the Grande Dame of Palestinian Letters), \r\nTawfiq Zayyad and May Ziade.
