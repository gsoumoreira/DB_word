In this introduction, you\'ll learn many earthshakingly \r\nimportant things, such as the history of the ah! in stars.\r\n\r\ncompiled by  Michael R. Burch \r\nwith the help of a number of credited contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\npass into nothingness ...\r\nJohn Keats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... you are whatever a moon has always meant\r\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you ...\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not love you like coral or topaz, \r\nor the blazing hearths incandescent white flame;\r\nI love you as obscure things are embraced in the dark ...\r\nsecretly, in shadows, unnamed  untamed.\r\nPablo Neruda, loose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove calls, everywhere and always.\r\nWe\'re sky bound.\r\nAre you coming?\r\nRumi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart is\r\nThe thousand-stringed instrument\r\nThat can only be tuned with\r\nLove.\r\nHafiz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\nSappho of Lesbos, loose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho is the first great lyric poet that we know by name today. The term \r\nlyric derives from the lyre, a harp-like musical instrument. Sappho is thus \r\nthe original singer-songwriter, and the artistic mother not only of lyric poets \r\nlike Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson, but also of \r\nsinger-songwriters like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Sam \r\nCooke and Carole King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefugee\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThese Strangers, in a foreign World,\r\nProtection asked of me\r\nBefriend them, lest Yourself in Heaven\r\nBe found a Refugee\r\n\r\nThis poem by one of the first great female American poets still speaks \r\neloquently, passionately and powerfully to the modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lady I Know\r\nby Countee Cullen\r\n\r\nShe thinks that even up in heaven\r\nHer class lies late and snores,\r\nWhile poor black cherubs rise at seven\r\nTo do celestial chores.\r\n\r\nCountee Cullen questions racism on earth and in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf You Should Go\r\nby Countee Cullen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove, leave me like the light, \r\nThe gently passing day; \r\nWe would not know, but for the night, \r\nWhen it has slipped away. \r\n\r\nSo many hopes have fled, \r\nHave left me but the name \r\nOf what they were. When love is dead, \r\nGo thou, beloved, the same. \r\n\r\nGo quietly; a dream \r\nWhen done, should leave no trace \r\nThat it has lived, except a gleam \r\nAcross the dreamers face. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDispensing Keys\r\nby Hafiz\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages\r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head\r\nwhenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys\r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\n\r\nI just love the wisdom and spirit of Hafiz in this subversive (pardon the pun) \r\nlittle poem. I can see jailers putting refugees in cages, while Hafiz goes around \r\nletting them out for a moondance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWild Swans\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nI looked in my heart while the wild swans went over.\r\nAnd what did I see I had not seen before?\r\nOnly a question less or a question more;\r\nNothing to match the flight of wild birds flying.\r\nTiresome heart, forever living and dying.\r\nHouse without air, I leave you and lock your door.\r\nWild swans, come over the town, come over\r\nThe town again, trailing your legs and flying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle\r\nby Alfred, Lord Tennyson\r\n\r\nHe clasps the crag with crooked hands;\r\nClose to the sun in lonely lands,\r\nRing\'d with the azure world, he stands.\r\n\r\nThe wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;\r\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\r\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell\r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State,\r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.\r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,\r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.\r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell worked as a control tower \r\noperator during World War II, an experience which influenced and provided \r\nmaterial for his poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaedmon\'s Hymn\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHumbly we honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe Measurer\'s might and his mind-plans,\r\nthe goals of the Glory-Father. First he, the Everlasting Lord,\r\nestablished Earth\'s fearful foundations.\r\nThen he, the Primeval Poet, hoisted heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\r\nMaker of mankind. Then he,\r\nthe Ever-Living Lord,\r\nafterwards made men middle earth, Master almighty!\r\n\r\nThe earliest Old English poem still extant today is probably C\xe6dmon\'s Hymn, \r\nwhich was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the scholar \r\nBede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who worked at the monastery of \r\nWhitby, a small English fishing village. C\xe6dmon, as Bede\'s story goes, was given \r\nthe gift of poetic composition by an angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarren Woman\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nEmpty, I echo to the least footfall,\r\nMuseum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.\r\nIn my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,\r\nNun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies\r\nExhale their pallor like scent.\r\n\r\nI imagine myself with a great public,\r\nMother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.\r\nInstead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.\r\nThe moon lays a hand on my forehead,\r\nBlank-faced and mum as a nurse.\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first modern confessional poets. When we hear songwriters like Janis Ian, Madonna and Taylor \r\nSwift telling us their inmost secrets, they are following in the footsteps of \r\nthe confessional poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nRequiescat is the first word in the Latin prayer Requiescat in pace \r\n(meaning Rest in peace). Oscar \r\nWilde wrote this poem for his beloved sister Isola, who died young. I believe \r\nWilde\'s poem may have been influenced by an elder poet, Robert Herrick ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother: Upon a Child\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nHere a pretty baby lies\r\nSung asleep with lullabies:\r\nPray be silent, and not stir\r\nTh\' easy earth that covers her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRondel\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting poem, not only because it\'s sad and lovely, but because \r\nthe poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne! And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to English \r\npoetry, adapting it from the French rondeau.

Leigh Hunt later recollected \r\nhow Keats would often look at his hand and remark with dismay that it was the \r\nhand of a fifty-year-old, even though he was only half that age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrel Man\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nAnd my throat\r\nIs deep with song,\r\nYou did not think\r\nI suffer after\r\nI\'ve held my pain\r\nSo long.\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nYou do not hear\r\nMy inner cry:\r\nBecause my feet\r\nAre gay with dancing,\r\nYou do not know\r\nI die.\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes was one of the first American poets to create a fusion between \r\nthe blues, jazz and modern poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpasse\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nI could tell you\r\nIf I wanted to,\r\nWhat makes me\r\nWhat I am.\r\n\r\nBut I don\'t \r\n\r\nReally want to\r\nAnd you don\'t\r\nGive a damn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiet Girl\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nI would liken you\r\nTo a night without stars\r\nWere it not for your eyes.\r\nI would liken you\r\nTo a sleep without dreams\r\nWere it not for your songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpigram Engraved on the Collar of a Dog Which I Gave to His Royal \r\nHighness\r\nby Alexander Pope\r\n\r\nI am his highness\'s dog at Kew;\r\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope, a poet famous for his satires such as The Dunciad and\r\nThe Rape of the Lock, wrote this satirical epigram in the 1730s and had it \r\nengraved on the collar of one of his puppies, which he gave to Frederick, Prince \r\nof Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bean Eaters\r\nby Gwendolyn Brooks\r\n\r\nThey eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair.\r\nDinner is a casual affair.\r\nPlain chipware on a plain and creaking wood.\r\nTin flatware.\r\n\r\nTwo who are Mostly Good.\r\nTwo who have lived their day,\r\nBut keep putting on their clothes\r\nAnd putting things away.\r\n\r\nAnd remembering...\r\nRemembering, with twinklings and twinges\r\nAs they lean over the beans in their rented back room that is full of beads and \r\nreceipts and dolls and clothes, tobacco crumbs, vases and fringes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nmysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. Frye, who had never written a poem before to our knowledge, composed the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' nominations, an \r\nunlettered orphan girl had joined the immortal poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaiku and Haiku-Like Poems \r\n\r\nLightning\r\nshatters the darkness:\r\nthe night heron\'s shriek.\r\nMatsuo Basho, loose translation \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPetals I amass\r\nwith such tenderness\r\nprick me to the quick.\r\nKobayashi Issa, loose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn a misty rain\r\nA butterfly is riding\r\nThe tail of a cow.\r\nRichard Wright\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moth\r\nby Walter de la Mare\r\n\r\nIsled in the midnight air,\r\nMusked with the dark\'s faint bloom,\r\nOut into glooming and secret haunts\r\nThe flame cries, \'Come!\'\r\n\r\nLovely in dye and fan,\r\nA-tremble in shimmering grace,\r\nA moth from her winter swoon\r\nUplifts her face:\r\n\r\nStares from her glamorous eyes;\r\nWafts her on plumes like mist;\r\nIn ecstasy swirls and sways\r\nTo her strange tryst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Aylmer\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nAh what avails the sceptred race,\r\nAh what the form divine!\r\nWhat every virtue, every grace!\r\nRose Aylmer, all were thine.\r\n\r\nRose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes\r\nMay weep, but never see,\r\nA night of memories and of sighs\r\nI consecrate to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDying Speech of an Old Philosopher\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\r\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\r\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake may have been the most influential poet/artist of all time. If \r\nyou want to know why, please click here:\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake the World\'s Most Influential Poet/Artist. Blake was a mystic \r\nwho said that he communicated with angels and saints on a daily basis. In \r\naddition to being one of England\'s greatest poets, he may have been its greatest \r\npainter and engraver as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowlyEden\r\nLips unused to thee\r\nBashfulsip thy jasmines\r\nAs the fainting bee\r\n\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums\r\nCounts his nectarsalights\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Bees Are Few\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,\r\nOne clover, and a bee,\r\nAnd revery.\r\nThe revery alone will do,\r\nIf bees are few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Charm Invests a Face\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nA Charm invests a face\r\nImperfectly beheld\r\nThe Lady dare not lift her Veil\r\nFor fear it be dispelled\r\n\r\nBut peers beyond her mesh\r\nAnd wishesand denies\r\nLest Interviewannul a want\r\nThat Imagesatisfies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Is Just to Say\r\nby William Carlos Williams\r\n\r\nI have eaten\r\nthe plums\r\nthat were in\r\nthe icebox\r\n\r\nand which\r\nyou were probably\r\nsaving\r\nfor breakfast\r\n\r\nForgive me\r\nthey were delicious\r\nso sweet\r\nand so cold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (anonymous Anglo-Saxon ballad, circa 990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nHere bloodthirsty men howl for sacrifice.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nWe are so different.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nhuge, battle-strong arms grabbed and engulfed me.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, oh, my Wulf! My desire for you\r\nhas made me sick; your seldom-comings\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Heaven-Watcher? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nTranslator\'s Notes: This ancient poem has been characterized as an elegy, a \r\nwild lament, a lover\'s lament, a passion play, a riddle, a song, or an early \r\nballad (it may be the earliest English poem with a refrain). However, most scholars place it within the genre of the frauenlied, or woman\'s song. It may be the first \r\nextant poem authored by a woman in the fledgling English \r\nlanguage; it seems likely that the poet was a woman because we don\'t usually think of \r\nancient scops pretending to be women. Wulf and Eadwacer might also be called \r\nthe first English feminist text, as the speaker seems to be challenging and \r\nmocking a man who has been abusing her. And the poem\'s closing \r\nmetaphor of a loveless relationship being like a song in which two voices never \r\nharmonized remains one of the strongest in the English language, or any \r\nlanguage.Michael R.

Out, out, brief candle!\r\nLifes but a walking shadow, a poor player\r\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\r\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\nSignifying nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Be The Verse\r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nThey fuck you up, your mum and dad.\r\nThey may not mean to, but they do.\r\nThey fill you with the faults they had\r\nAnd add some extra, just for you.\r\n\r\nBut they were fucked up in their turn\r\nBy fools in old-style hats and coats,\r\nWho half the time were soppy-stern\r\nAnd half at one another\'s throats.\r\n\r\nMan hands on misery to man.\r\nIt deepens like a coastal shelf.\r\nGet out as early as you can,\r\nAnd don\'t have any kids yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet No Charitable Hope\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nNow let no charitable hope\r\nConfuse my mind with images\r\nOf eagle and of antelope:\r\nI am in nature none of these.\r\n\r\nI was, being human, born alone;\r\nI am, being woman, hard beset;\r\nI live by squeezing from a stone\r\nThe little nourishment I get.\r\n\r\nIn masks outrageous and austere\r\nThe years go by in single file;\r\nBut none has merited my fear,\r\nAnd none has quite escaped my smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOphelia\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nMy locks are shorn for sorrow\r\nOf love which may not be;\r\nTomorrow and tomorrow\r\nAre plotting cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe winter wind tangles\r\nThese ringlets half-grown,\r\nThe sun sprays with spangles\r\nAnd rays like his own.\r\n\r\nOh, quieter and colder\r\nIs the stream; he will wait;\r\nWhen my curls touch my shoulder\r\nHe will comb them straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nLight the first light of evening, as in a room\r\nIn which we rest and, for small reason, think\r\nThe world imagined is the ultimate good.\r\n\r\nThis is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous.\r\nIt is in that thought that we collect ourselves,\r\nOut of all the indifferences, into one thing:\r\n\r\nWithin a single thing, a single shawl\r\nWrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth,\r\nA light, a power, the miraculous influence.\r\n\r\nHere, now, we forget each other and ourselves.\r\nWe feel the obscurity of an order, a whole,\r\nA knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nWithin its vital boundary, in the mind.\r\nWe say God and the imagination are one ...\r\nHow high that highest candle lights the dark.\r\n\r\nOut of this same light, out of the central mind,\r\nWe make a dwelling in the evening air,\r\nIn which being there together is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Forge\r\nby Seamus Heaney\r\n\r\nAll I know is a door into the dark.\r\nOutside, old axles and iron hoops rusting;\r\nInside, the hammered anvils short-pitched ring,\r\nThe unpredictable fantail of sparks\r\nOr hiss when a new shoe toughens in water.\r\nThe anvil must be somewhere in the centre,\r\nHorned as a unicorn, at one end and square,\r\nSet there immoveable: an altar\r\nWhere he expends himself in shape and music.\r\nSometimes, leather-aproned, hairs in his nose,\r\nHe leans out on the jamb, recalls a clatter\r\nOf hoofs where traffic is flashing in rows;\r\nThen grunts and goes in, with a slam and flick\r\nTo beat real iron out, to work the bellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdlestrop\r\nby Edward Thomas\r\n\r\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\r\nThe name, because one afternoon\r\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\r\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\r\n\r\nThe steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\r\nNo one left and no one came\r\nOn the bare platform. What I saw\r\nWas Adlestroponly the name\r\n\r\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\r\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\r\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\r\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\r\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\r\nFarther and farther, all the birds\r\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nNever until the mankind making\r\nBird beast and flower\r\nFathering and all humbling darkness\r\nTells with silence the last light breaking\r\nAnd the still hour\r\nIs come of the sea tumbling in harness\r\n\r\nAnd I must enter again the round\r\nZion of the water bead\r\nAnd the synagogue of the ear of corn\r\nShall I let pray the shadow of a sound\r\nOr sow my salt seed\r\nIn the least valley of sackcloth to mourn\r\n\r\nThe majesty and burning of the child\'s death.\r\nI shall not murder\r\nThe mankind of her going with a grave truth\r\nNor blaspheme down the stations of the breath\r\nWith any further\r\nElegy of innocence and youth.\r\n\r\nDeep with the first dead lies London\'s daughter,\r\nRobed in the long friends,\r\nThe grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,\r\nSecret by the unmourning water\r\nOf the riding Thames.\r\nAfter the first death, there is no other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServitude\r\nby Anne Reeve Aldrich\r\n\r\nThe church was dim at vespers.\r\nMy eyes were on the Rood.\r\nBut yet I felt thee near me,\r\nIn every drop of blood.\r\n\r\nIn helpless, trembling bondage\r\nMy soul\'s weight lies on thee,\r\nO call me not at dead of night,\r\nLest I should come to thee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon Julia\'s Clothes\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nWhenas in silks my Julia goes,\r\nThen, then, methinks, how sweetly flows\r\nThe liquefaction of her clothes.\r\n\r\nNext, when I cast mine eyes and see\r\nThat brave vibration each way free,\r\nOh, how that glittering taketh me!\r\n\r\nDelight in Disorder\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nA sweet disorder in the dress\r\nKindles in clothes a wantonness:\r\nA lawn about the shoulders thrown\r\nInto a fine distraction\r\nAn erring lace, which here and there\r\nEnthrals the crimson stomacher\r\nA cuff neglectful, and thereby\r\nRibbands to flow confusedly\r\nA winning wave, deserving note,\r\nIn the tempestuous petticoat\r\nA careless shoe-string, in whose tie\r\nI see a wild civility\r\nDo more bewitch me than when art\r\nIs too precise in every part.\r\n\r\nUpon Julia\'s Breasts\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nDisplay thy breasts, my Julia, there let me\r\nBehold that circummortal purity;\r\nBetween whose glories, there my lips Ill lay,\r\nRavished in that fair Via Lactea.\r\n\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\ne. e. cummings\r\n\r\nsince feeling is first\r\nwho pays any attention\r\nto the syntax of things\r\nwill never wholly kiss you;\r\nwholly to be a fool\r\nwhile Spring is in the world\r\n\r\nmy blood approves,\r\nand kisses are a better fate\r\nthan wisdom\r\nlady i swear by all flowers.

Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of wanton loveliness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that men hold dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you\r\nthrough lustrous flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no leaf nor petal of rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair flower of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would plant love\'s tendrils again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\n\r\nI have been here before,\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\nThe sweet keen smell,\r\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore.\r\nYou have been mine before,\r\nHow long ago I may not know:\r\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\r\nYour neck turned so,\r\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore.\r\nHas this been thus before?\r\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\r\nStill with our lives our love restore\r\nIn death\'s despite,\r\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\n\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays\r\nby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nThe mill-stream, now that noises cease,\r\nIs all that does not hold its peace;\r\nUnder the bridge it murmurs by,\r\nAnd here are night and hell and I.\r\n\r\nWho made the world I cannot tell;\r\n\'Tis made, and here I am in hell.\r\nMy hand, though now my knuckles bleed,\r\nI never soiled with such a deed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, no doubt, in time gone by,\r\nSome have suffered more than I,\r\nWho only spend the night alone\r\nAnd strike my fist upon the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCradle Song\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W.

Auden\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdge\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe woman is perfected.\r\nHer dead\r\nBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\r\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\r\nFlows in the scrolls of her toga,\r\nHer bare\r\nFeet seem to be saying:\r\nWe have come so far, it is over.\r\nEach dead child coiled, a white serpent,\r\nOne at each little\r\nPitcher of milk, now empty.\r\nShe has folded\r\nThem back into her body as petals\r\nOf a rose close when the garden\r\nStiffens and odors bleed\r\nFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.\r\nThe moon has nothing to be sad about,\r\nStaring from her hood of bone.\r\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\r\nHer blacks crackle and drag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nThe world goes none the lamer\r\nFor ought that I can see,\r\nBecause this cursed trouble\r\nHas struck my days and me.\r\n\r\nThe stars of heaven are steady,\r\nThe founded hills remain,\r\nThough I to earth and darkness\r\nReturn in blood and pain.\r\n\r\nFarewell to all belongings\r\nI won or bought or stole;\r\nFarewell, my lusty carcase,\r\nFarewell, my aery soul.\r\n\r\nOh worse remains for others\r\nAnd worse to fear had I\r\nThan here at four-and-twenty\r\nTo lay me down and die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Death to Either Shall Come\r\nby Robert Bridges\r\n\r\nWhen Death to either shall come,\r\nI pray it be first to me,\r\nBe happy as ever at home,\r\nIf so, as I wish, it be.\r\n\r\nPossess thy heart, my own;\r\nAnd sing to the child on thy knee,\r\nOr read to thyself alone\r\nThe songs that I made for thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nCrossing alone the nighted ferry\r\n With the one coin for fee,\r\nWhom, on the wharf of Lethe waiting,\r\n Count you to find? Not me.\r\n\r\nThe brisk fond lackey to fetch and carry,\r\n The true, sick-hearted slave,\r\nExpect him not in the just city\r\n And free land of the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWild Asters\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nIn the spring I asked the daisies\r\n If his words were true,\r\nAnd the clever, clear-eyed daisies\r\n Always knew.\r\n\r\nNow the fields are brown and barren,\r\n Bitter autumn blows,\r\nAnd of all the stupid asters\r\n Not one knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nRemember\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nRemember me when I am gone away,\r\nGone far away into the silent land;\r\nWhen you can no more hold me by the hand,\r\nNor I half turn to go yet turning stay.\r\nRemember me when no more day by day\r\nYou tell me of our future that you plann\'d:\r\nOnly remember me; you understand\r\nIt will be late to counsel then or pray.\r\nYet if you should forget me for a while\r\nAnd afterwards remember, do not grieve:\r\nFor if the darkness and corruption leave\r\nA vestige of the thoughts that once I had,\r\nBetter by far you should forget and smile\r\nThan that you should remember and be sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from More Poems\r\nby A.

For why\r\nWill man lament the state he should envy?\r\nTo have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\r\nAnd, if no other misery, yet age?\r\nRest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\r\nBen Jonson his best piece of poetry,\r\nFor whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\r\nAs what he loves may never like too much.\r\n\r\nOn My First Daughter\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nHere lies, to each her parents\' ruth,\r\nMary, the daughter of their youth;\r\nYet all heaven\'s gifts being heaven\'s due,\r\nIt makes the father less to rue.\r\n\r\nAt six months\' end, she parted hence\r\nWith safety of her innocence;\r\nWhose soul heaven\'s queen, whose name she bears,\r\nIn comfort of her mother\'s tears,\r\nHath placed amongst her virgin-train:\r\nWhere, while that severed doth remain,\r\nThis grave partakes the fleshly birth;\r\nWhich cover lightly, gentle earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\r\nBut as for me, alas!, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame.\r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. A common interpretation of this poem is that its deer (dear) is Anne \r\nBoleyn and its Caesar is King Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmoretti, Sonnet #75\r\nby Edmund Spenser\r\n\r\nOne day I wrote her name upon the strand,\r\nBut came the waves and washed it away:\r\nAgain I wrote it with a second hand,\r\nBut came the tide, and made my pains his prey.\r\nVain man, said she, that doest in vain assay,\r\nA mortal thing so to immortalize,\r\nFor I myself shall like to this decay,\r\nAnd eke my name be wiped out likewise.\r\nNot so, quoth I, let baser things devise\r\nTo die in dust, but you shall live by fame:\r\nMy verse, your virtues rare shall eternize,\r\nAnd in the heavens write your glorious name.\r\nWhere when as death shall all the world subdue,\r\nOur love shall live, and later life renew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExile\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nMy hands have not touched pleasure since your hands,\r\nNo,nor my lips freed laughter since \'farewell\',\r\nAnd with the day, distance again expands\r\nVoiceless between us, as an uncoiled shell.\r\n\r\nYet love endures, though starving and alone.\r\nA dove\'s wings cling about my heart each night\r\nWith surging gentleness, and the blue stone\r\nSet in the tryst-ring has but worn more bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A.

Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains.

yet to my fancied sight\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Spell before Winter\r\nby Howard Nemerov\r\n\r\nAfter the red leaf and the gold have gone,\r\nBrought down by the wind, then by hammering rain\r\nBruised and discolored, when October\'s flame\r\nGoes blue to guttering in the cusp, this land\r\nSinks deeper into silence, darker into shade.\r\nThere is a knowledge in the look of things,\r\nThe old hills hunch before the north wind blows.\r\n\r\nNow I can see certain simplicities\r\nIn the darkening rust and tarnish of the time,\r\nAnd say over the certain simplicities,\r\nThe running water and the standing stone,\r\nThe yellow haze of the willow and the black\r\nSmoke of the elm, the silver, silent light\r\nWhere suddenly, readying toward nightfall,\r\nThe sumac\'s candelabrum darkly flames.\r\nAnd I speak to you now with the land\'s voice,\r\nIt is the cold, wild land that says to you\r\nA knowledge glimmers in the sleep of things:\r\nThe old hills hunch before the north wind blows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtue\r\nby George Herbert\r\n\r\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\r\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\r\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\nFor thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\nThy root is ever in its grave,\r\nAnd thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\r\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\r\nAnd all must die.\r\n\r\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\r\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\r\nThen chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Stealby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\r\nI had no human fears:\r\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\r\nThe touch of earthly years.\r\n\r\nNo motion has she now, no force;\r\nShe neither hears nor sees;\r\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\r\nWith rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.

Many had lost their boots\r\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.\r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling,\r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime...\r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace\r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin;\r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\r\nPro patria mori.\r\n\r\nNote: Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\nfrom Horace\'s Odes and means: It is sweet and fitting\r\nto die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long duration Horace\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\nLove and desire and hate:\r\nI think they have no portion in us after\r\nWe pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\nOut of a misty dream\r\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\r\nWithin a dream.\r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known\r\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\nTwine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s wife had waited long,\r\nThe tea was cold, the fire was dead;\r\nAnd there might yet be nothing wrong\r\nIn how he went and what he said:\r\nThere are no millers any more,\r\nWas all that she had heard him say;\r\nAnd he had lingered at the door\r\nSo long it seemed like yesterday.\r\nSick with a fear that had no form\r\nShe knew that she was there at last;\r\nAnd in the mill there was a warm\r\nAnd mealy fragrance of the past.\r\nWhat else there was would only seem\r\nTo say again what he had meant;\r\nAnd what was hanging from a beam\r\nWould not have heeded where she went.\r\nAnd if she thought it followed her,\r\nShe may have reasoned in the dark\r\nThat one way of the few there were\r\nWould hide her and would leave no mark:\r\nBlack water, smooth above the weir\r\nLike starry velvet in the night,\r\nThough ruffled once, would soon appear\r\nThe same as ever to the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bustle In A House\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThe bustle in a house\r\nThe morning after death\r\nIs solemnest of industries\r\nEnacted upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping up the heart\r\nAnd putting love away\r\nWe shall not want to use again\r\nUntil eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Turtle  by Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks\r\nWhich practically conceal its sex.\r\nI think it clever of the turtle\r\nIn such a fix to be so fertile.\r\n\r\nThe Cow\r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe cow is of the bovine ilk;\r\nOne end is moo, the other, milk.\r\n\r\nPoets\r\nby Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nPoets aren\'t very useful\r\nBecause they aren\'t consumeful or produceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maidens Song\r\nAnonymous Medieval Lyric\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maidens came when I was in my mothers bower.\r\nI had all that I would.\r\n\r\nThe bailey beareth the bell away;\r\nThe lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nThe silver is white, red is the gold;\r\nThe robes they lay in fold.\r\n\r\nThe bailey beareth the bell away;\r\nThe lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nAnd through the glass window shines the sun.\r\nHow should I love, and I so young?\r\n\r\nThe bailey beareth the bell away;\r\nThe lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Earthwardby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April\r\nShakes out her rain-drenched hair,\r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted,\r\nI shall not care.\r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful\r\nWhen rain bends down the bough;\r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted\r\nThan you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tyger\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nTyger!

Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?\r\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?\r\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.\r\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?\r\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)\r\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might.

The sea!) was the cry of the Greek mercenaries in \r\nXenophon\'s Anabasis when they saw the Black Sea, which told them they were \r\nnearing home after a failed march against the Persian Empire in 401 BC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho ever loved\r\nby Christopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is overruled by fate.\r\nWhen two are stripped, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should love, the other win;\r\n\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows; let it suffice\r\nWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever loved, that loved not at first sight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night,\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors;\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeaven-Haven\r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI have desired to go\r\nWhere springs not fail,\r\nTo fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,\r\nAnd a few lilies blow.\r\n\r\nAnd I have asked to be\r\nWhere no storms come,\r\nWhere the green swell is in the havens dumb,\r\nAnd out of the swing of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mistress Margaret Hussey\r\nby John Skelton\r\n\r\nMerry Margaret,\r\nAs midsummer flower,\r\nGentle as falcon\r\nOr hawk of the tower;\r\nWith solace and gladness,\r\nMuch mirth and no madness,\r\nAll good and no badness;\r\nSo joyously,\r\nSo maidenly,\r\nSo womanly\r\nHer demeaning\r\nIn every thing,\r\nFar, far passing\r\nThat I can endite,\r\nOr suffice to write\r\nOf merry Margaret,\r\nAs midsummer flower,\r\nGentle as falcon\r\nOr hawk of the tower.\r\nAs patient and as still\r\nAnd as full of good will\r\nAs fair Isaphill;\r\nColyander,\r\nSweet pomander,\r\nGood Cassander;\r\nSteadfast of thought,\r\nWell made, well wrought,\r\nFar may be sought\r\nEre that ye can find\r\nSo courteous, so kind\r\nAs merry Margaret,\r\nThis midsummer flower,\r\nGentle as falcon\r\nOr hawk of the tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Wear the Mask\r\nby Paul Laurence Dunbar\r\n\r\nWe wear the mask that grins and lies,\r\nIt hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,\r\nThis debt we pay to human guile;\r\nWith torn and bleeding hearts we smile,\r\nAnd mouth with myriad subtleties.\r\n\r\nWhy should the world be overwise,\r\nIn counting all our tears and sighs?\r\nNay, let them only see us, while\r\nWe wear the mask.\r\n\r\nWe smile, but, O great Christ, our cries\r\nTo thee from tortured souls arise.\r\nWe sing, but oh the clay is vile\r\nBeneath our feet, and long the mile;\r\nBut let the world dream otherwise,\r\nWe wear the mask!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Child\'s Amaze\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nSilent and amazed, even when a little boy,\r\nI remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,\r\nAs contending against some being or influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dreams of My Heart\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nThe dreams of my heart and my mind pass,\r\nNothing stays with me long,\r\nBut I have had from a child\r\nThe deep solace of song;\r\n\r\nIf that should ever leave me,\r\nLet me find death and stay\r\nWith things whose tunes are played out and forgotten\r\nLike the rain of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh! Sunflower\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAh! sunflower, weary of time,\r\nWho countest the steps of the sun,\r\nSeeking after that sweet golden clime\r\nWhere the travellers journey is done;\r\n\r\nWhere the youth pined away with desire,\r\nAnd the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\r\nArise from their graves and aspire;\r\nWhere my sunflower wishes to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Clear Midnight\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nThis is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,\r\nAway from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,\r\nThee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou lovest \r\nbest.\r\nNight, sleep, death and the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Am!\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\nI am: yet what I am none cares or knows,\r\nMy friends forsake me like a memory lost;\r\nI am the self-consumer of my woes,\r\nThey rise and vanish in oblivious host,\r\nLike shades in love and death\'s oblivion lost;\r\nAnd yet I am! and live with shadows tost\r\n\r\nInto the nothingness of scorn and noise,\r\nInto the living sea of waking dreams,\r\nWhere there is neither sense of life nor joys,\r\nBut the vast shipwreck of my life\'s esteems;\r\nAnd e\'en the dearestthat I loved the best\r\nAre strangenay, rather stranger than the rest.\r\n\r\nI long for scenes where man has never trod;\r\nA place where woman never smil\'d or wept;\r\nThere to abide with my creator, God,\r\nAnd sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:\r\nUntroubling and untroubled where I lie;\r\nThe grass belowabove the vaulted sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirge Without Music\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.\r\nSo it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:\r\nInto the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned\r\nWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.\r\n\r\nLovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.\r\nBe one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.\r\nA fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,\r\nA formula, a phrase remains,but the best is lost.\r\n\r\nThe answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\r\nThey are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled\r\nIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not \r\napprove.\r\nMore precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.\r\n\r\nDown, down, down into the darkness of the grave\r\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;\r\nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.\r\nI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poems listed below now appear on\r\nThe Masters of \r\nEnglish Poetry and Literature, Part \r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Funeral Blues" by W.
