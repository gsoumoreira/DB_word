Before we \nconsider that question, let\'s define what the term carpe diem means \nand examine the history of the genre briefly.\nThe words Carpe Diem begin the last line of a Latin poem by Quintus \nHoratius Flaccus (65 BC \x96 8 BC), who is better known today as Horace. The poem appears \nin Horace\'s Odes, book one, number eleven. Carpe Diem means something like seize the day or pluck the day, while it\'s still ripe. \nCarpe Diem poems consider time and its ravages, death and loss. Some of \nthe poems are of the eat, drink and make merry because tomorrow we die ilk. \nBut poets have found other approaches to the subject as well ...\n\ncompiled by Michael R.

Burch\n\nLord, it is time. Let the immense summer go.\nLay your long shadows over the sundials\nand over the meadows, let the free winds blow.\nCommand the late fruits to fatten and shine;\nO, grant them another Mediterranean hour!\nUrge them to completion, and with power\nconvey final sweetness to the heavy wine.\nWho has no house now, never will build one.\nWho\'s alone now, shall continue alone;\nhe\'ll wake, read, write long letters to friends,\nand pace the tree-lined pathways up and down,\nrestlessly, as autumn leaves drift and descend.\n\n\n\nArchaic Torso of Apollo\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\nloose translation by \nMichael R.

But still\nthe figure\'s trunk glows with the strange vitality\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\nnor the centering loins make us smile\nat the thought of their generative animus. \nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\nprojecting procreation\'s triangular spearhead upwards,\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\nlike an inchoate stardemanding our belief. \nYou must change your life.\n\n\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\nby William Dunbar\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\ndelightful lily of wanton loveliness,\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\nand in every virtue that men hold dear\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you\nthrough lustrous flowers of freshest hue,\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\nyet everywhere, no leaf nor petal of rue. \n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\nhas slain my fair flower of pallid and gentle cast,\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\nthat, if I could, I would plant love\'s root again\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\n\n\nThis Living Hand\nby John Keats\n\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\nI hold it towards you.\n\n\n\nNothing Gold Can Stayby Robert Frost\n\nNature\'s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.\n\n\n\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\nby Ernest Dowson\n\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long duration Horace\n\nThey are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\nLove and desire and hate:\nI think they have no portion in us after\nWe pass the gate.\n\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\nOut of a misty dream\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\nWithin a dream.\n\n\n\nOn the Eve of His Execution\nby Chidiock Tichborne\n\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\n\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\n\n\nEternity\nby William Blake\n\nHe who binds to himself a joy,\nDoes the winged life destroy;\nHe who kisses the joy as it flies,\nLives in Eternity\'s sun rise.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I Was One-and-Twenty\nby A. E. Housman\n\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\nI heard a wise man say,\nGive crowns and pounds and guineas\nBut not your heart away;\nGive pearls away and rubies\nBut keep your fancy free.\nBut I was one-and-twenty,\nNo use to talk to me.\n\nWhen I was one-and-twenty\nI heard him say again,\nThe heart out of the bosom\nWas never given in vain;\n\'Tis paid with sighs a plenty\nAnd sold for endless rue.\nAnd I am two-and-twenty\nAnd oh, \'tis true, \'tis true.\n\n\n\n\nTo Daffodils\nby Robert Herrick\n\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\n You haste away so soon.\nAs yet the early-rising sun\n Hath not attained his noon.\n Stay, stay,\n Until the hasting day\n Has run\n But to the even-song;\nAnd, having prayed together, we\n Will go with you along.\n\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\n We have as short a spring;\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\n As you, or any thing.\n We die.\n As your hours do, and dry\n Away\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\n Ne\'er to be found again.\n\n\n\nGo, Lovely Rose\nby Edmund Waller\n\n\n Go, lovely Rose,\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\n That now she knows,\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\n\n Tell her that\'s young,\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\n That hadst thou sprung\nIn deserts where no men abide,\nThou must have uncommended died.\n\n Small is the worth\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\n Bid her come forth,\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\n\n Then die, that she\nThe common fate of all things rare\n May read in thee;\nHow small a part of time they share,\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Last Word\nby Ernest Dowson\n\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand;\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown;\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band.\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust.\nTwine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\n\n\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\nDylan Thomas\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n\n\nWild Asters\nby Sara Teasdale\n\nIn the spring I asked the daisies\nIf his words were true,\nAnd the clever, clear-eyed daisies\nAlways knew.\n\nNow the fields are brown and barren,\nBitter autumn blows,\nAnd of all the stupid asters\nNot one knows.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts from More Poems\n\nby A. E. Housman\n\nXXXVI\n\nHere dead we lie we because we did not choose\nTo live and shame the land from which we sprung.\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\nBut young men think it is, and we were young.\n\n\n\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \n\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\nThose that I guard I do not love;\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\nNo likely end could bring them loss\nOr leave them happier than before.\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\nA lonely impulse of delight\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\nA waste of breath the years behind\nIn balance with this life, this death.\n\n\n\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer\nby Walt Whitman\n\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\nlecture-room,\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\n\n\n\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\nby e. e. cummings\n\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\nThe woodland paths are dry,\nUnder the October twilight the water\nMirrors a still sky;\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\nSince I first made my count;\nI saw, before I had well finished,\nAll suddenly mount\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\nAnd now my heart is sore.\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\nThe first time on this shore,\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\nThey paddle in the cold,\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water\nMysterious, beautiful;\nAmong what rushes will they build,\nBy what lakes edge or pool\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\nTo find they have flown away?\n\n\n\nBread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\n\n\nThe Snow Man\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\n\n\nPiano\nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\n\n\nSong For The Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\n\n\nThe Death of a Toad\nby Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep monotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard daylight steer.\n\n\n\nAcquainted With The Night\nby Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\n\n\nWhen You Are Old\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOzymandias\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nI met a traveller from an antique land\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\n\n\nThe Bustle In A House\nby Emily Dickinson\n\nThe bustle in a house\nThe morning after death\nIs solemnest of industries\nEnacted upon earth.\n\nThe sweeping up the heart\nAnd putting love away\nWe shall not want to use again\nUntil eternity.\n\n\n\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\nby Robert Herrick\n\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\n Old Time is still a-flying:\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\n Tomorrow will be dying.\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\nThe sooner will his race be run,\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\nThat age is best which is the first,\n When youth and blood are warmer;\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\n Times still succeed the former.\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\n And while ye may, go marry:\nFor having lost but once your prime,\n You may for ever tarry.\n\n\n\nSong: To Celia\nby Ben Jonson\n\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\nDoth ask a drink divine:\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\nI would not change for thine.\n\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\nNot so much honouring thee,\nAs giving it a hope, that there\nIt could not withered be.\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\nNot of itself, but thee.\n\n\n\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\nby John Keats\n\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\nNever have relish in the faery power\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\n\n\n\nMore Carpe Diem Poems:\n\nArchaic Torso of Apollo by Rainer Maria Rilke\nDreams by Langston Hughes\nTo His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell\nAs You Like It, Act II, Scene VII [All the world\'s a stage] by William Shakespeare\nLoveliest of Trees by A.
