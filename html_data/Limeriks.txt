Which limericks are the \r\nraciest, the raunchiest, the weirdest, the zaniest, the coolest, the most \r\nheretical and irreverent? \r\n\r\nThis page attempts to answer such questions for students, educators and anyone \r\ninterested in the most entertaining and least-buttoned-down of the English \r\npoetic forms. Here you will find limericks by the expected masters of the form, \r\nincluding Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll and Ogden Nash. But you will also find \r\nlimericks by unexpected authors like Salman Rushdie and Dean Martin! If you like \r\na raunchy jokes, you have certainly found the right page. (However, children are \r\nadvised to stop reading after the four Ogden Nash limericks.)\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael \r\nR. Burch\r\n\r\nWe have a new page devoted to everyone\'s favorite coronavirus conqueror:\r\nDonald Trump Limericks\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this page reflects one person\'s opinion, for whatever \r\nthat\'s worth ...\r\n\r\nMy personal top ten limerick writers are: (#10) Rudyard \r\nKipling, (#9) Dr. Seuss (who employed anapestic limerick meter in much of his \r\nhumorous verse), (#8) Algernon Charles Swinburne, (#7) W. H. Auden, \r\n(#6) William Shakespeare, (#5) Hilaire Belloc, (#4) Lewis \r\nCarroll, (#3) Edward Lear, (#2) Anonymous, including the poets of Mother Goose \r\nfame, and (#1) Ogden Nash, my landslide winner. \r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: Thomas Aquinas, Isaac Asimov, Morris Bishop, Robert Conquest, Wendy Cope, T. \r\nS. Eliot, Elizabeth I, Eugene Field, W. S. Gilbert, Robert Herrick, Leigh Hunt, \r\nErica Jong, James Joyce, Spike Milligan, Dante Gabriel \r\nRossetti, Robert Louis Stevenson, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Mark Twain, John Updike, H. G. Wells, James \r\nWhistler\r\n\r\nMy top ten limericks and limerick-like poems: (#10) There Was a Young Lady of \r\nNiger, attributed to Edward Lear; (#9) the Nantucket limericks by various \r\nauthors; (#8) The Ant by Ogden Nash; (#7) The Bee by Edward Lear; (#6) a \r\nnumber of naughty limericks by various authors included here, (#5) the Mother Goose \r\nlimericks by various authors; (#4) The Pelican by Dixon Lanier Merritt; (#3) \r\nThe Hippopotamus by Hilaire Belloc; (#2) The Turtle by Ogden Nash; \r\n(#1) Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song written in limerick meter by Anonymous (or \r\nwas Shakespeare perhaps the author?)\r\n\r\nHarold Bloom suggested that Shakespeare may have been the author of Tom \r\nO\'Bedlam\'s Song. If so, that would move Shakespeare up to number one on my list \r\nof the top ten limerick writers. I will explore this intriguing idea when I \r\nget to the poem, later on this page. And what an amazing poem it is!\r\n\r\nConcise definition of the limerick: A typically humorous, bawdy and/or \r\nnonsensical, verse of three longer and two shorter lines that usually rhymeAABBA. There is \r\na more detailed definition later on this page which identifies a curious \r\ndifference between modern limericks and those of the father of the limerick, \r\nEdward Lear. (As you read his limericks on this page, please see if you can identify \r\nthe difference.) However, not all limericks are \r\nhumorous. Take, for instance, this inspirational limerick-like poem recited by \r\nYolanda Renee King, the 9-year-old granddaughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \r\nat the March for Our Lives event in Washington D.C., where student activists and \r\ntheir supporters rallied against gun violence:\r\n\r\nSpread the word!\r\nHave you heard? \r\nAll across the nation,\r\nWe are going to be\r\nA great generation!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a much more somber note, we have a page of poetic elegies from around the globe:\r\nPoems for the Victims and Survivors of the \r\nCoronavirus\r\n\r\nHere is brief history of the limerick, in the form of a Limerick Timeline. More detailed historical \r\ninformation appears later on this \r\npage. Some of the dates are approximations or educated guesses. \r\n\r\n561\x97The name Limerick dates back to at least 561 AD, but it is not clear when the Irish city and county became associated with the verse form.\r\n977\x97The last Norse (Viking) king of Limerick, known as Ivar of Limerick, dies in 977. \r\n1197\x97King Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart, grants the city of Limerick its first charter. \r\n1225\x97Saint Thomas Aquinas may have written the first limerick: a prayer in Latin! \r\n1300\x97The ancient Anglo-Saxon (Old English) poem Sumer is i-comen in, also known as the Cuckoo Song, is limerick-like. \r\n1322\x97A limerick-like poem The lion is wondirliche strong is one of the oldest such poems extant today.\r\n1533\x97Queen Elizabeth I has been credited with writing a limerick about a daughter of debate. \r\n1560\x97Shakespeare includes limericks and/or employs limerick meter in Othello, King Lear, The Tempest, Anthony and Cleopatra and Henry IV, Part II.\r\n1590\x97Edmund Spenser publishes Mother Hubbard\'s Tale, a precursor to Mother Goose poems and stories to come. \r\n1591\x97Robert Herrick writes a lovely limerick about a glow-worm. \r\n1615\x97The great anonymous poem about madness, Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song, is written in limerick meter. \r\n1626\x97The first texts containing the French terms mere l\x92oye or mere oye (Mother Goose). \r\n1697\x97Charles Perrault publishes the first Mother Goose collection of rhymes and folk tales in France, essentially creating the fairy tale genre of literature. \r\n\r\n1700\x97By the early 18th century, drinking songs and Gaelic minstrels insulting \r\neach other in verse have laid the foundation for the limerick form we know and \r\nlove.\r\n1706\x97The Maigue poets are the first Limerick-based poets known to have written limericks, led by Sean O\x92 Tuama (1706-1775) and Andrias MacCriath (1710-1793). \r\n1729\x97Robert Samber translates Perrault\'s fairy tales into English.\r\n1760\x97Limericks are published in Boston in the book Mother Goose\x92s Melody, \r\nwhich includes Jack and Jill, Seesaw Margery Daw and Hey Diddle Diddle.\r\n1821\x97John Marshall publishes the first English books with limericks: The History of Sixteen Wonderful Old Women and Anecdotes and Adventures of Fifteen Gentlemen.\r\n1830\x97Edward Lear, an artist and illustrator by trade, discovers and reads Marshall\'s books.\r\n1846\x97Edward Lear publishes A Book of Nonsense. He also gives drawing \r\nlessons to Queen Victoria. \r\n1863\x97Lear\'s book sells well and a third edition is published. Soon notable poets \r\nlike Algernon Charles Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti are employing the limerick form, often \r\nin naughty ways. Around this time Punch publishes limericks \r\nuntil they become too bawdy and sacrilegious for polite English society! But the \r\nform endures and thrives. \r\n1865\x97Inklings for Thinklings is published during the American Civil War. It contains 35 limericks with illustrations. \r\n\r\n1896\x97The first known use of the term limerick for the already-popular poetic \r\nform appears in a letter by artist Aubrey Beardsley to Leonard Smithers. \r\nPreviously, contemporaries of Edward Lear had called them learics (perhaps a \r\npun on his name and lyrics).\r\n1902\x97The first Nantucket limerick is published in the Princeton Tiger: The poem inspires a number of witty responses. \r\nAnd in an interesting synchronicity, Ogden Nash is born just in time for the \r\nlimerick boom. \r\n1907\x97The London Opinion sparks a limerick craze in England, which is \r\nsuddenly even more jolly. The New York Times reports that GREAT \r\nBRITAIN IS LIMERICK-CRAZY with Millions Competing for Prizes Offered by Almost \r\nEvery Popular Paper in England! The British post office struggles to keep up \r\nwith all the submissions. And the rest, as they say, is history \r\n...\r\n\r\nboth Limerick Timelines were\r\ncompiled \r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBefore I delve deeper into the definition and colorful history of the limerick, please allow me \r\nto share some examples in the form of personal favorites:\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady named Bright\r\nwho traveled much faster than light.\r\nShe set out one day\r\nin a relative way,\r\nand came back the previous night.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently learned that the limerick above was originally penned in a slightly \r\ndifferent version by Arthur Henry Reginald Buller; his limerick appeared in Punch (Dec. 19, 1923) \r\n\r\nI find it intriguing that one of the best revelations of the weirdness and \r\nzaniness of \r\nrelativity can be found in a limerick. Buller\'s limerick inspired me to pennot onebut two rejoinders:\r\n\r\nCosmological Constant\r\n\r\nEinstein, the frizzy-haired,\r\nsaid E equals MC squared.\r\nThus all mass decreases\r\nas activity ceases?\r\nNot my mass, my ass declared!\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nAss-tronomical \r\n\r\n\r\nRelativity, the theorists creed,\r\nsays mass increases with speed.\r\nMy (m)ass grows when I sit it.\r\nMr. Einstein, get with it;\r\nequate its deflation, I plead!\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s a scientific limerick that amuses me:\r\n\r\nA mosquito cried out in pain: \r\nA chemist has poisoned my brain! \r\nThe cause of his sorrow\r\nwas para-dichloro-\r\ndiphenyl-trichloroethane. \r\n\r\nFor our non-chemist readers, paraDichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane is the the full \r\nname for DDT.\r\n\r\nEdward Lear has been called the father and the poet laureate of the limerick because he \r\nhelped popularize the form. To be frank, I believe other poets, particularly Ogden \r\nNash, have penned better limericks, but I do admire this one, which has been \r\nattributed to Lear:\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady of Niger\r\nwho smiled as she rode on a tiger;\r\nThey returned from the ride\r\nwith the lady inside,\r\nand the smile on the face of the tiger.\r\n\x97attributed to Edward Lear and William Cosmo Monkhouse\r\n\r\nHere\'s another Lear limerick that I especially like and admire:\r\n\r\nThere was an Old Man in a tree, \r\nWho was horribly bored by a bee. \r\nWhen they said Does it buzz? \r\nHe replied Yes, it does! \r\nIt\'s a regular brute of a bee!\r\n\x97Edward Lear\r\n\r\nLear banked 125 pounds for his Book of Nonsense, a princely sum for a \r\nwriter in those days. And the title of his book may have inspired our term \r\nnonsense verse. There are more of his limericks later on this page.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a limerick-like poem that has long been a favorite of mine:\r\n\r\nI shoot the Hippopotamus\r\nWith bullets made of platinum,\r\nBecause if I use leaden ones\r\nHis hide is sure to flatten \'em.\r\n\x97Hilaire Belloc\r\n\r\nHere\'s another of my all-time favorites, which illustrates how punning wordplay \r\ncan spice up limericks:\r\n\r\nA wonderful bird is the pelican;\r\nHis beak can hold more than his belican.\r\nHe can hold in his beak\r\nEnough food for a week,\r\nThough Im damned if I know how the helican!\r\n\x97Dixon Lanier Merritt (often incorrectly \r\nascribed to Ogden Nash)\r\n\r\nThe limerick above reminds me of something Dorothy Parker once said about Oscar \r\nWilde: that when she discovered an especially good epigram, she always assumed that Wilde \r\nwas its author. Ogden Nash holds a similar place of distinction in the pantheon \r\nof limerick writers. One thing Nash did wonderfully well was ignore the rules that often result in \r\nstiffly-corseted formal poems. Nash\'s poems tend to be funny, irreverent, \r\nwhimsical and loosey-goosy. (Nash is to limericks as e. e. cummings is to sonnets.) Here are a few of Nash\'s best limericks and limerick-like poems:\r\n\r\nThere was a young belle of old Natchez\r\nWhose garments were always in patchez.\r\nWhen comments arose\r\nOn the state of her clothes,\r\nShe replied, When Ah itchez, Ah scratchez.\r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nA flea and a fly in a flue\r\nWere imprisoned, so what could they do?\r\nSaid the fly, let us flee!\r\nLet us fly! said the flea.\r\nSo they flew through a flaw in the flue.\r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks \r\nWhich practically conceal its sex. \r\nI think it clever of the turtle \r\nIn such a fix to be so fertile.\r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe ant has made himself illustrious\r\nThrough constant industry industrious.\r\nSo what?\r\nWould you be calm and placid\r\nIf you were full of formic acid?\r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThere are more poems by Nash later on this page. If we give credit to Lear for \r\npopularizing the form, shouldn\'t we give even more credit to Nash for perfecting \r\nit? \r\n\r\nWhile most limericks are humorous, the form has been adapted for more serious \r\npurposes. Here\'s a poem of mine that can be shared with anyone it might help . . \r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf Reflection\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor anyone struggling with self-image\r\n\r\nShe has a comely form \r\nand a smile that brightens her dorm . . .\r\nbut she\x92s grossly unthin \r\nwhen seen from within; \r\nsoon a griefstricken campus will mourn. \r\n\r\nYet she\x92d never once criticize \r\na friend for the size of her thighs. \r\nDo unto others\x97\r\nsisters and brothers? \r\nYes, but also ourselves, likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf Reflection analysis, theme and meaning.\r\n\r\nThis limerick-like poem of mine delves into literary criticism:\r\n\r\nCaveat Spender\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt\'s better not to speculate\r\ncontinually on who is great.\r\nThough relentless awe\'s\r\na C\xe9l\xe8bre Cause,\r\nplease reserve some time for the contemplation\r\nof the perils of\r\nExaggeration.\r\n\r\nMoving on, some of the best limericks are naughty poems \r\nwritten by the greatest and most prolific of all poets, Anonymous. (I  \r\ncaution children to stop reading at this point!)\r\n\r\nThere was a young man from Savannah\r\nWho died in a curious manner:\r\nHe whittled a hole\r\nIn a telephone pole\r\nAnd electrified his banana.\r\n\x97Anonymous\r\n\r\nThere once was a hermit named Dave\r\nWho kept a dead whore in his cave.\r\nI know it\'s a sin,\r\nHe said with a grin,\r\nBut just think of the money I save!\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nThere was a young gal name of Sally\r\nWho loved an occasional dally.\r\nShe sat on the lap\r\nOf a well-endowed chap\r\nCrying, Gee, Dick, you\'re right up my alley!\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nThere once was a man from Kent\r\nWhose drill was severely bent.\r\nTo save himself trouble, \r\nHe put it in double\r\nAnd while he was coming, he went.\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nWhile Titian was mixing rose madder, \r\nHis model reclined on a ladder. \r\nHer position to Titian \r\nSuggested coition, \r\nSo he leapt up the ladder and had \'er. \r\n\x97Anonymous\r\n\r\nA pious young lady of Chichester \r\nMade all the pale saints in their niches stir. \r\nAnd each morning at matin \r\nHer breast in pink satin \r\nMade the bishop of Chichester\'s breeches stir.\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nThere once was a man named O\'Doul\r\nWho found red spots dotting his tool.\r\nHis doctor (a cynic)\r\nRan him out of the clinic\r\nCrying, Wipe off that lipstick, you fool!\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nThere once was a lady of Totten\r\nWhose tastes grew perverted and rotten.\r\nShe cared not for steaks,\r\nNor for pastries, nor cakes,\r\nBut lived solely on penis au gratin.\r\n\x97Anonymous (I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nThere was a sweet girl of Decatur \r\nwho went to sea on a freighter. \r\nShe was screwed by the master\r\n\x97an utter disaster\x97\r\nbut the crew all made up for it later.\r\n\x97Isaac Asimov\r\n\r\nA man called Percival Lee \r\nGot up one night for a pee. \r\nWhen he got to the loo \r\nIt was quarter to two, \r\nAnd when he got back it was three. \r\n\x97Spike Milligan\r\n\r\nShotgun Bedding\r\n\r\nA pedestrian pediatrician \r\nset out on a dangerous mission;\r\nthough his child bride, Lolita, \r\nwas a sweet senorita, \r\nher pa\'s shotgun cut off his emissions.\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe have an intro to the next three limericks, provided by Tom Cushing: There \r\nwas a band traveling the college frat house circuit, many years ago, called Doug \r\nClark And The Hot Nuts. They did a bit called the Dirty Thirty in which the \r\nband vamped a swing beat while various members recited limericks in time. They\'d \r\nthen pass the microphone around to the party goers, and let them have a try.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Nuts are said to have been the inspiration for Otis Day and the Knights \r\nin the movie Animal House. They recorded My Ding-a-Ling in 1961, a \r\ndecade before Chuck Berry made it famous (or infamous). \r\n\r\nThere once was a couple named Kelly\r\nWho walked around belly to belly\r\nBecause, in their haste, \r\nThey used library paste\r\nInstead of petroleum jelly!\r\n\x97Anonymous (Suggested by Tom Cushing)\r\n\r\nA lovely young lady named Alice \r\nUsed a dynamite stick as a phallus.\r\nThey found her vagina\r\nIn North Carolina\r\nAnd bits of her titties in Dallas.\r\n\x97Anonymous (Suggested by Tom Cushing)\r\n\r\nThere once was a lovely young lass\r\nWho had a magnificent ass:\r\nNot smooth, round and pink\r\nAs you probably think,\r\nBut a rough, gray-maned cropper of grass.\r\n\x97Anonymous (Suggested by Tom Cushing; I touched this one up slightly)\r\n\r\nAs one critic put it, the limerick is the vehicle of cultivated, unrepressed sexual humor in \r\nthe English language. But while some experts claim that the only real limerick is an \r\nobscene or bawdy one, the form \r\nreally took off initially, in terms of popularity, as a vehicle for nonsense verse and children\'s poems, such as the \r\nMother Goose nursery rhymes:\r\n\r\nHickory dickory dock,\r\nthe mouse ran up the clock;\r\nthe clock struck one\r\nand down he run;\r\nhickory dickory dock. \r\n\x97Mother Goose, first published in 1744 in Tom Thumb\'s Pretty Songbook\r\n\r\nThere was an Old Man with a beard, \r\nWho said, It is just as I feared!\r\nTwo Owls and a Hen,\r\nFour Larks and a Wren,\r\nHave all built their nests in my beard!\r\n\x97Edward Lear\r\n\r\nThere was a Young Lady whose chin\r\nResembled the point of a pin:\r\nSo she had it made sharp,\r\nAnd purchased a harp,\r\nAnd played several tunes with her chin.\r\n\x97Edward Lear\r\n\r\nThere was an old man of the Cape \r\nWho made himself garments of crepe. \r\nWhen asked, Do they tear? \r\nHe replied, Here and there, \r\nBut they\'re perfectly splendid for shape!\r\n\x97Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\nKarma School\r\nNot everything lost will be found.\r\nI keep my high hopes on the ground. \r\nDespite what we\'re taught, \r\nMore often than not, \r\nWhat goes around just goes around. \r\n\x97O.V. Michaelsen\r\n\r\nA Postal Tip\r\n\r\nSome shippers are hard to out-fox,\r\nAnd books are as heavy as rocks. \r\nExpensive to mail? \r\nTry cheating the scale. \r\nPump helium into the box.\r\n\x97O.V. Michaelsen\r\n\r\nDot Spotted\r\n\r\nThere once was a leopardess, Dot,\r\nwho indignantly answered: I\x92ll not!\r\nThe gents are impressed\r\nwith the way that Im dressed.\r\nI wouldnt change even one spot!\r\n\x97Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBut rules are made to be broken, especially by rebellious, inventive poets. \r\nHere\'s one of my favorite rule-breakers, with the theme of breaking the rules:\r\n\r\nThis limerick goes in reverse \r\nUnless I\x92m remiss\r\nThe neat thing is this:\r\nIf you start from the bottom-most verse \r\nThis limerick\x92s not any worse.\r\n\x97Zach Weiner\r\n\r\nIf read from the top down, the limerick breaks the rules. If read from the \r\nlast line up, however, it obeys. Very clever! \r\n\r\nTo show the flexibility of the limerick form, it has often been used for political \r\npurposes, and to expose, satirize and savage charlatans. Here are are two such limericks of mine:\r\n\r\nBaked Alaskan\r\n\r\nThere is a strange yokel so flirty\r\nshe makes whores seem icons of purity.\r\nWith all her winkin and blinkin\r\nPalin seems to be "thinkin"\r\nAh culd save th free world cause ahm purty!\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 by Michael R. Burch\r\nfrom Signs of the Apocalypse\r\nall Rights and Violent Shudderings Reserved\r\n\r\nGoing Rogue in Rouge\r\n\r\nIt\'ll be hard to polish that apple\r\nenough to make her seem palatable.\r\nThough she\'s sweeter than Snapple\r\nhow can my mind grapple\r\nwith stupidity so nearly infallible?\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 by Michael R. Burch\r\nfrom Signs of the Apocalypse\r\nall Rights and Violent Shudderings Reserved\r\n\r\nExpanded\r\nLimerick Definition:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most common form of the limerick is a stanza of five lines, in which the first, \r\nsecond and fifth lines rhyme with each another and have three feet of three \r\nsyllables each, while the third and fourth lines rhyme with each \r\nother, but are shorter, having only two feet of three syllables each. The metrical foot \r\nemployed is usually the anapest, (ta-ta-TUM), but limericks can also be \r\namphibrachic (ta-TUM-ta). The syllable counts for long limericks are typically \r\n99669 while short limericks are usually 88558. However, as you can see from the last two poems by Nash and \r\nmy poems directly above, there are other variations of the form. While the vast \r\nmajority of limericks have the rhyme scheme AABBA, some have the scheme ABCCB \r\nand there are other variants. For instance, if you examine \r\nthe limericks of Edward Lear on this page, you will see that the \r\nfather of the limerick would use one rhyming word twice, so that rather \r\nthan having the rhyme pattern AABBA, his was either A*BB* or *ABB* (where the \r\nasterisk denotes a word used twice that rhymes with the ending word of line A). \r\nHowever, this repetition of one rhyme word is not common in modern \r\nlimericks.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a classic amphibrachic limerick:\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady of Lynn, \r\nWho was so uncommonly thin \r\nThat when she essayed \r\nTo drink lemonade \r\nShe slipped through the straw and fell in!\r\n\x97Anonymous\r\n\r\nExpanded History of the Limerick:\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name limerick for this humorous poetic form is still being debated. \r\nThe term was first officially documented in England in 1898, in the New \r\nEnglish Dictionary, but the form itself is much older. The name is generally \r\nconsidered to be a reference to the \r\ncity or county of Limerick, Ireland, and may derive from a parlor game that \r\nincluded a refrain such as Will [or won\'t] you come (up) to \r\nLimerick? The earliest known use of the name limerick for a \r\nshort, humorous lyric is an 1880 reference in a New Brunswick \r\nnewspaper to a tune apparently well-known at the time, Won\x92t you come to Limerick? That article included this verse:\r\n\r\nThere was a young rustic named Mallory,\r\nwho drew but a very small salary.\r\nWhen he went to the show,\r\nhis purse made him go\r\nto a seat in the uppermost gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest published American limerick appeared in 1902 in the Princeton Tiger:\r\n\r\nThere once was a man from Nantucket\r\nWho kept all his cash in a bucket.\r\nBut his daughter, named Nan,\r\nRan away with a man\r\nAnd as for the bucket, Nantucket.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated sequels were soon published. \r\nOf these, two of the most famous appeared, respectively, in the Chicago \r\nTribune and the New York Press:\r\n\r\nBut he followed the pair to Pawtucket,\r\nThe man and the girl with the bucket;\r\nAnd he said to the man,\r\nHe was welcome to Nan,\r\nBut as for the bucket, Pawtucket.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the pair followed Pa to Manhasset,\r\nWhere he still held the cash as an asset;\r\nBut Nan and the man\r\nStole the money and ran,\r\nAnd as for the bucket, Manhasset.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere continue to be modern sequels, including this bawdy one of mine:\r\n\r\nThere was a lewd whore from Nantucket\r\nwho intended to pee in a bucket;\r\nbut being a man\r\nshe missed the damn can\r\nand her rattled johns fled, crying: Fuck it!\r\n\x97Variation on a classic limerick by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere\'s another bawdy Nantucket limerick, author unknown:\r\n\r\nThere once was a man from Nantucket\r\nWhose schlong was so long he could sucket\r\nHe said with a grin\r\nWiping spunk off his chin\r\nIf my ear were a cunt I could fucket!\r\n\x97Anonymous \r\n\r\nHere are three linked Nantucket limericks of mine:\r\n\r\nThere was a coarse whore of Nantucket \r\nwhose bush needed someone to pluck it \r\n\x92cause it looked like a chimp\x92s \r\nand her johns were limp gimps \r\nwho refused to touch, suck it or fuck it. \r\n\r\nSo that coarse, canny whore of Nantucket,\r\nonce muff-shaved, decided to shuck it \r\n\x97that thick, wiry pelt \r\nthat smelled like wet felt\x97 \r\nand made it a toupee for Luckett. \r\n\r\nNow Luckett, once bald as an eagle, \r\nlike Samson stands handsome and regal \r\nwith hair to his ass \r\nthat smells like his lass, \r\nbut still comes when she calls, like a beagle. \r\n\x97a triple limerick by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLimericks are often associated historically with Edward Lear, whose first published limericks appeared in A Book of Nonsense in 1846, \r\nalthough his poems were not called limericks at the time. \r\nBut Lear didn\x92t invent the form. It appears that during \r\nhis stays at Knowsley Hall in the 1830s, he discovered a book, Anecdotes and Adventures of Fifteen Gentlemen, which contained limericks \r\npublished by John Marshall in 1822. Two similar books had \r\nbeen published around the same time: Anecdotes and Adventures of Fifteen Young Ladies and The \r\nHistory of Sixteen Wonderful Old Women. It seems likely that these books \r\nemployed a form that was already popular at the time, and that Lear liked the \r\nform and began using it himself.\r\n\r\nBut limericks had already been published in Boston in the 1760 book \r\nMother Goose\x92s Melody, which included still-popular poems like Jack and \r\nJill, Seesaw Margery Daw and Hey Diddle Diddle.\r\nFurthermore, we can trace the limerick back to \r\nthe eighteenth-century Fil\xed na M\xe1ighe, or Gaelic poets of the Maigue, a \r\npub in Croom, County Limerick. Se\xe1n \xd3\x92Tuama (1709-1775) and Aindrias MacCraith \r\n(1710-1793) were members of this group, which sometimes verbally sparred in \r\nverses employing limerick meter. Some of their poems were translated into English by the poet James \r\nClarence Mangan and later appeared in both languages in John O\x92Daly\x92s The Poets and \r\nPoetry of Munster, published in 1850. This is an example of their repartee:\r\n\r\nSe\xe1n \xd3\x92Tuama:\r\n\r\nI sell the best Brandy and Sherry\r\nTo make all my customers merry,\r\nBut at times their finances\r\nRun short as it chances,\r\nAnd then I feel very sad, very.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which MacCraith replied:\r\n\r\nO\x92Tuama! You boast yourself handy\r\nAt selling good ale and bright Brandy,\r\nBut the fact is your liquor\r\nMakes everyone sicker;\r\nI tell you this, I, your friend, Andy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut where did they discover the limerick? It may be possible that in \r\nthe early 1700s soldiers returning from the War of the Spanish Succession \r\nbrought the limerick to Ireland from the European mainland. One possible route \r\nwas through France. The first texts containing the French \r\nterms mere l\x92oye or mere oye (Mother Goose) date to 1626. Then \r\nin 1697, Charles Perrault published the first Mother Goose collection of rhymes and \r\nfolk tales, essentially creating the fairy tale genre of literature. Later, in 1729, \r\nRobert Samber translated Perrault\'s fairy tales into English. While Perrault\'s \r\nfairy tales were written in prose, the combination of fairy tales and limerick \r\nmeter could have resulted in interesting mergers. \r\n\r\nBut the limerick form may be far older.\r\nIt has been suggested that the limerick originated in France during the \r\nMiddle Ages. An 11th century manuscript demonstrates the limericks cadence:\r\n\r\nThe lion is wondrous strong\r\nAnd full of the wiles of wo; (woe)\r\nAnd whether he pleye (play)\r\nOr take his preye (prey)\r\nHe cannot do but slo. (slay)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest English poems, still largely Anglo-Saxon and betraying its \r\nGermanic roots, may date to circa 1300 and is limerick-like:\r\n\r\nSvmer is icumen in \r\nLhude sing cuccu! \r\nGrowe\xfe sed \r\nand blowe\xfe med \r\nand spring\xfe \xfee wde nu! \r\nSing cuccu!\r\n\r\n\r\nParaphrased in Modern English, the poem means something like: Summer is coming. \r\nSing loud, cuckoo! The seed is growing and the meadow is blowing and the wood is \r\nspringing up new. Sing cuckoo! \r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616) employed limerick meter in Stephanos drinking song \r\nfrom The Tempest:\r\n\r\nThe master, the swabber, the boatswain and I, \r\nThe gunner and his mate \r\nLoved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery, \r\nBut none of us cared for Kate; \r\nFor she had a tongue with a tang, \r\nWould cry to a sailor, Go hang! \r\nShe loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch, \r\nYet a tailor might scratch her where\'er she did itch: \r\nThen to sea, boys, and let her go hang!\r\n\x97from The Tempest by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nShakespeare employed an actual limerick in a drinking song from Othello:\r\n\r\nAnd let me the canakin clink, clink;\r\n(canakin = drinking can)\r\nAnd let me the canakin clink \r\nA soldier\'s a man; \r\nA life\'s but a span; \r\nWhy, then, let a soldier drink.\r\n\x97from Othello by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nAnother drinking song, this one from \x93Anthony and Cleopatra,\x94 is limerick-like:\r\n\r\nCome, thou monarch of the vine, \r\nPlumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!\r\nIn thy fats our cares be drown\'d,\r\nWith thy grapes our hairs be crown\'d:\r\nCup us, till the world go round,\r\nCup us, till the world go round!\r\n\x97from Anthony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nYet another drinking song, this one from Henry IV, Part II, is limerick-like:\r\n\r\nDo nothing but eat and make good cheer, \r\nAnd praise God for the merry year; \r\nWhen flesh is cheap and females dear, \r\nAnd lusty lads roam here and there, \r\nSo merrily, and ever among so merrily.\r\n\x97from Henry IV, Part II by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThe great poem about madness, Tom O\'Bedlam, circa 1615, was written in limerick \r\nmeter. Here\'s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\r\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\r\nThe flaming drake \r\nand the night crow make\r\nMe music to my sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe literary critic Harold Bloom has proposed Shakespeare as the author of Tom \r\nO\'Bedlam, a poem he calls the greatest anonymous lyric in the [English] \r\nlanguage. As I understand Bloom, his argument is the poem\'s excellence. (Bloom \r\nhas been accused of bardolatry and has gone so far \r\nas to write a book in which he proposed that Shakespeare invented the modern \r\nhuman being.) While I don\'t claim to know that Shakespeare had anything to do \r\nwith writing Tom O\'Bedlam, he was one of the first English writers to write \r\nlimericks and incorporate them into plays. And in King Lear, \r\nShakespeare had Edgar disguise himself as mad Tom o\' Bedlam. So I find the \r\nidea intriguing, if perhaps improvable either way.\r\n\r\nEdward Lear\'s A Book of Nonsense (1846) was an important step in the \r\ndevelopment and popularization of the limerick form, although such lyrics would \r\nbe called learics until the term limerick began to appear around 1896. There \r\nwould be second and third editions of Lear\'s book in 1855 and 1861. Imitators \r\nsoon caught the limerick wave. Ye Book of Sense: A Companion to the Book of \r\nNonsense (1863) was followed by The New Book of Sense (1864). The \r\nlatter book, published in Philadelphia, apparently spawned a fad for this verse \r\nform in America. \r\n\r\nThe limerick form became very popular in the early 1900s, when limericks were \r\npublished widely in newspapers, magazines and literary journals.\r\n\r\nIt\'s interesting that some of the earliest published limericks, including \r\nShakespeare\'s, were related to \r\ntaverns and drinking. One might speculate that people had a few drinks, \r\nloosened up, then began competitions in which they sang or chanted bawdy songs \r\nand poems, with the winner getting a free \r\ndrink, applause, and perhaps a kiss from a serving wench. It may have been hundreds of \r\nyears before literary types started to take limericks seriously enough to start \r\nwriting them down. But they eventually got smart and did just that. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn modern times limerick meter has been employed in songs. For instance: You\'re \r\nin the Army Now, Popeye the Sailor Man and even the moody Piano Man by \r\nBilly Joel. \r\n\r\nFamous penners of limericks now include Shakespeare, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Dante \r\nGabriel Rossetti, Ogden Nash, Rudyard Kipling, Mark \r\nTwain, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, James Joyce, Lewis Carroll, \r\nAlgernon Charles Swinburne,\r\nSalman Rushdie  \r\nand Isaac Asimov. Here \r\nare examples of limericks by famous writers:\r\n\r\nThere was a small boy of Quebec\r\nWho was buried in snow to his neck.\r\nWhen they asked, Are you friz?\r\nHe replied, Yes, I is \r\nBut we don\'t call this cold in Quebec! \r\n\x97Rudyard Kipling\r\n\r\nOur novels get longa and longa\r\nTheir language gets stronga and stronga\r\nTheres much to be said\r\nFor a life that is led\r\nIn illiterate places like Bonga!\r\n\x97H. G. Wells\r\n\r\nI finally found the perfect girl.\r\nI could not ask for more.\r\nShe\'s deaf and dumb and oversexed.\r\nAnd owns a liquor store.\r\n\x97attributed to Dean Martin, who often joked about his excessive drinking \r\n\r\nSome primal termite knocked on wood \r\nAnd tasted it, and found it good! \r\nAnd that is why your Cousin May \r\nFell through the parlor floor today. \r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe ostrich roams the great Sahara. \r\nIts mouth is wide, its neck is narra. \r\nIt has such long and lofty legs, \r\nI\'m glad it sits to lay its eggs. \r\n\x97Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nT. S. Eliot is quite at a loss\r\nWhen clubwomen bustle across\r\nAt literary teas\r\nCrying, What, if you please,\r\nDid you mean by The Mill On the Floss?\r\n\x97W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nThere was a young lady of station \r\nI love man was her sole exclamation \r\nBut when men cried, You flatter \r\nShe replied, Oh! no matter!\r\nIsle of Man is the true explanation. \r\n\x97Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\nThere is a poor sneak called Rossetti\r\nAs a painter with many kicks met he\r\nWith more as a man\r\nBut sometimes he ran\r\nAnd that saved the rear of Rossetti.\r\n\x97Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\n\r\nThe marriage of poor Kim Kardashian\r\nWas krushed like a kar in a krashian.\r\nHer Kris kried, Not fair!\r\nWhy kan\'t I keep my share? \r\nBut Kardashian fell klean outa fashian.\r\n\x97Salman Rushdie \r\n\r\nI have written a number of limericks myself, under the magical spell of the \r\nform:\r\n\r\nDear Ed: I dont understand why\r\nyou will publish this other guy\r\nwhen Im brilliant, devoted,\r\none hell of a poet!\r\nYet you publish Anonymous. Fie!\r\n\r\nFie!

Burch\r\n\r\nNOTE: The poem above is a double limerick. \r\n\r\nThere once was a mockingbird, Clyde,\r\nwho bragged of his prowess, but lied.\r\nTo his new wife he sighed,\r\nWhen again, gentle bride?\r\nNevermore! bright-eyed Raven replied.\r\n\x97Michael R.
