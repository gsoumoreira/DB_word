Burch\r\n\r\nThe best American poetry begins with two highly original poets, Walt Whitman and \r\nEmily Dickinson, who were as different from each other as two people can be, at \r\nleast on the surface. After them, it seems the floodgates of modern American \r\npoetry opened, as this page demonstrates. According to the Mentor Book of Major \r\nAmerican Poets, the major American poets, in order by birth date, are Edward \r\nTaylor (1645), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807), \r\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809), Walt Whitman (1819), Emily Dickinson (1830), Edwin \r\nArlington Robinson (1869), Stephen Crane (1871), Robert Frost (1874), Vachel \r\nLindsay (1879), Wallace Stevens (1879), William Carlos Williams (1883), Ezra \r\nPound (1885), Marianne Moore (1887), John Crowe Ransom (1888), Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay (1892), Archibald MacLeish (1892), e. e. cummings (1894), Hart Crane \r\n(1899) and W. H. Auden (1907). To that list I would personally add Conrad Aiken, \r\nElizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, T. S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Robinson Jeffers, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Ann Sexton and Richard \r\nWilbur. Other strong contenders include Maya Angelou, Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, \r\nRobert Hayden, Ogden Nash, Dorothy Parker, W. D. Snodgrass, Sara Teasdale and \r\nElinor Wylie. \r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nLips unused to thee.\r\nBashful, sip thy jasmines,\r\nAs the fainting bee,\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums,\r\nCounts his nectarsalights,\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the\r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\nby James Wright\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\nTwilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\'s wrist.\r\nSuddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto blossom.\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nIn A Station Of The Metro\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd:\r\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden \r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth. \r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n        \r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\r\n        \r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge by Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God. \r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nDaddy\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nYou do not do, you do not do\r\nAny more, black shoe\r\nIn which I have lived like a foot\r\nFor thirty years, poor and white,\r\nBarely daring to breathe or Achoo.\r\n\r\nDaddy, I have had to kill you.\r\nYou died before I had time\r\nMarble-heavy, a bag full of God,\r\nGhastly statue with one gray toe\r\nBig as a Frisco seal\r\n\r\nAnd a head in the freakish Atlantic\r\nWhere it pours bean green over blue\r\nIn the waters off the beautiful Nauset.\r\nI used to pray to recover you.\r\nAch, du.\r\n\r\nIn the German tongue, in the Polish town\r\nScraped flat by the roller\r\nOf wars, wars, wars.\r\nBut the name of the town is common.\r\nMy Polack friend\r\n\r\nSays there are a dozen or two.\r\nSo I never could tell where you\r\nPut your foot, your root, \r\nI never could talk to you.\r\nThe tongue stuck in my jaw.\r\n\r\nIt stuck in a barb wire snare.\r\nIch, ich, ich, ich,\r\nI could hardly speak.\r\nI thought every German was you.\r\nAnd the language obscene\r\n\r\nAn engine, an engine, \r\nChuffing me off like a Jew.\r\nA Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.\r\nI began to talk like a Jew.\r\nI think I may well be a Jew.\r\n\r\nThe snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna \r\nAre not very pure or true.\r\nWith my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck\r\nAnd my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack\r\nI may be a bit of a Jew.\r\n\r\nI have always been scared of you,\r\nWith your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.\r\nAnd your neat mustache\r\nAnd your Aryan eye, bright blue.\r\nPanzer-man, panzer-man, O You\r\n\r\nNot God but a swastika\r\nSo black no sky could squeak through.\r\nEvery woman adores a Fascist,\r\nThe boot in the face, the brute\r\nBrute heart of a brute like you.\r\n\r\nYou stand at the blackboard, daddy,\r\nIn the picture I have of you,\r\nA cleft in your chin instead of your foot\r\nBut no less a devil for that, no not\r\nAny less the black man who\r\n\r\nBit my pretty red heart in two.\r\nI was ten when they buried you.\r\nAt twenty I tried to die\r\nAnd get back, back, back to you.\r\nI thought even the bones would do.\r\n\r\nBut they pulled me out of the sack,\r\nAnd they stuck me together with glue.\r\nAnd then I knew what to do.\r\nI made a model of you,\r\nA man in black with a Meinkampf look\r\n\r\nAnd a love of the rack and the screw.\r\nAnd I said I do, I do.\r\nSo daddy, I\'m finally through.\r\nThe black telephone\'s off at the root,\r\nThe voices just can\'t worm through.\r\n\r\nIf I\'ve killed one man, I\'ve killed two-\r\nThe vampire who said he was you\r\nAnd drank my blood for a year,\r\nSeven years, if you want to know.\r\nDaddy, you can lie back now.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a stake in your fat black heart\r\nAnd the villagers never liked you.\r\nThey are dancing and stamping on you.\r\nThey always knew it was you.\r\nDaddy, daddy, you bastard, I\'m through.\r\nTrue Love\r\nby Robert Penn Warren\r\nIn silence the heart raves. It utters words\r\nMeaningless, that never had\r\nA meaning. I was ten, skinny, red-headed,\r\nFreckled. In a big black Buick,\r\nDriven by a big grown boy, with a necktie, she sat\r\nIn front of the drugstore, sipping something\r\nThrough a straw. There is nothing like\r\nBeauty. It stops your heart. It\r\nThickens your blood. It stops your breath. It\r\nMakes you feel dirty. You need a hot bath.\r\nI leaned against a telephone pole, and watched.\r\nI thought I would die if she saw me.\r\nHow could I exist in the same world with that brightness?\r\nTwo years later she smiled at me. She\r\nNamed my name. I thought I would wake up dead.\r\nHer grown brothers walked with the bent-knee\r\nSwagger of horsemen. They were slick-faced.\r\nTold jokes in the barbershop. Did no work.\r\nTheir father was what is called a drunkard.\r\nWhatever he was he stayed on the third floor\r\nOf the big white farmhouse under the maples for twenty-five years.\r\nHe never came down. They brought everything up to him.\r\nI did not know what a mortgage was.\r\nHis wife was a good, Christian woman, and prayed.\r\nWhen the daughter got married, the old man came down wearing\r\nAn old tail coat, the pleated shirt yellowing.\r\nThe sons propped him. I saw the wedding. There were\r\nEngraved invitations, it was so fashionable. I thought\r\nI would cry. I lay in bed that night\r\nAnd wondered if she would cry when something was done to her.\r\nThe mortgage was foreclosed. That last word was whispered.\r\nShe never came back. The family\r\nSort of drifted off. Nobody wears shiny boots like that now.\r\nBut I know she is beautiful forever, and lives\r\nIn a beautiful house, far away.\r\nShe called my name once.

\r\nOne end is moo, the other, milk. \r\n\r\nThe Ostrich \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe ostrich roams the great Sahara. \r\nIts mouth is wide, its neck is narra. \r\nIt has such long and lofty legs, \r\nI\'m glad it sits to lay its eggs. \r\n\r\nThe Termite   by Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nSome primal termite knocked on wood \r\nAnd tasted it, and found it good! \r\nAnd that is why your Cousin May \r\nFell through the parlor floor today. \r\n\r\nThe Turtle   by Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks \r\nWhich practically conceal its sex. \r\nI think it clever of the turtle \r\nIn such a fix to be so fertile. \r\n\r\nThe Wasp \r\n\r\nby Ogden Nash \r\n\r\nThe wasp and all his numerous family \r\nI look upon as a major calamity. \r\nHe throws open his nest with prodigality, \r\nBut I distrust his waspitality. \r\n\r\nI Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died by Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nI heard a fly buzz when I died;\r\nThe stillness round my form\r\nWas like the stillness in the air\r\nBetween the heaves of storm.\r\n\r\nThe eyes beside had wrung them dry,\r\nAnd breaths were gathering sure\r\nFor that last onset, when the King\r\nBe witnessed in his power.\r\n\r\nI willed my keepsakes, signed away\r\nWhat portion of me I\r\nCould make assignable  and then\r\nThere interposed a fly,\r\n\r\nWith blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz\r\nBetween the light and me;\r\nAnd then the windows failed  and then\r\nI could not see to see.\r\n\r\nTo Earthward by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April \r\n Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, \r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted, \r\n I shall not care. \r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful \r\n When rain bends down the bough; \r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted \r\n Than you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaplinesque by Hart Crane\r\n\r\nWe will make our meek adjustments,\r\nContented with such random consolations\r\nAs the wind deposits\r\nIn slithered and too ample pockets.\r\n\r\nFor we can still love the world, who find\r\nA famished kitten on the step, and know\r\nRecesses for it from the fury of the street,\r\nOr warm torn elbow coverts.\r\n\r\nWe will sidestep, and to the final smirk\r\nDally the doom of that inevitable thumb\r\nThat slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,\r\nFacing the dull squint with what innocence\r\nAnd what surprise!\r\n\r\nAnd yet these fine collapses are not lies\r\nMore than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;\r\nOur obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.\r\nWe can evade you, and all else but the heart:\r\nWhat blame to us if the heart live on.\r\n\r\nThe game enforces smirks; but we have seen\r\nThe moon in lonely alleys make\r\nA grail of laughter of an empty ash can,\r\nAnd through all sound of gaiety and quest\r\nHave heard a kitten in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\n\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\nOr rich with red corundum or with blue,\r\nLocked, and the key withheld, as other girls\r\nHave given their loves, I give my love to you;\r\nNot in a lovers\'-knot, not in a ring\r\nWorked in such fashion, and the legend plain\r\nSemper fidelis, where a secret spring\r\nKennels a drop of mischief for the brain:\r\nLove in the open hand, no thing but that,\r\nUngemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,\r\nAs one should bring you cowslips in a hat\r\nSwung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,\r\nI bring you, calling out as children do:\r\nLook what I have!And these are all for you.\r\n\r\nResume\r\nby Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nRazors pain you;\r\nRivers are damp;\r\nAcids stain you;\r\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\r\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\r\nNooses give;\r\nGas smells awful;\r\nYou might as well live.\r\n\r\n\r\nFires \r\nby Joseph Campbell\r\n\r\nThe little fires that Nature lights \r\nThe scilla\'s lamp, the daffodil \r\nShe quenches, when of stormy nights\r\nHer anger whips the hill.\r\n\r\nThe fires she lifts against the cloud \r\nThe irised bow, the burning tree \r\nShe batters down with curses loud,\r\nNor cares that death should be.\r\n\r\nThe fire she kindles in the soul \r\nThe poet\'s mood, the rebel\'s thought \r\nShe cannot master, for their coal\r\nIn other mines is wrought.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks \r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\r\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\r\n\r\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\r\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\r\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\r\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\r\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\r\n\r\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\r\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\r\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\r\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\r\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\r\n\r\n\r\nBarter  \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nAll beautiful and splendid things,\r\nBlue waves whitened on a cliff,\r\nSoaring fire that sways and sings,\r\nAnd children\'s faces looking up\r\nHolding wonder in a cup.\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nMusic like a curve of gold,\r\nScent of pine trees in the rain,\r\nEyes that love you, arms that hold,\r\nAnd for your spirit\'s still delight,\r\nHoly thoughts that star the night.\r\n\r\nSpend all you have for loveliness,\r\nBuy it and never count the cost;\r\nFor one white singing hour of peace\r\nCount many a year of strife well lost,\r\nAnd for a breath of ecstasy\r\nGive all you have been, or could be.\r\n\r\nPeaceby Sara Teasdale\r\nPeace flows into me \r\nAs the tide to the pool by the shore; \r\nIt is mine forevermore, \r\nIt ebbs not back like the sea. \r\n\r\nI am the pool of blue \r\nThat worships the vivid sky; \r\nMy hopes were heaven-high, \r\nThey are all fulfilled in you. \r\n\r\nI am the pool of gold \r\nWhen sunset burns and dies, \r\nYou are my deepening skies, \r\nGive me your stars to hold.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlchemyby Sara Teasdale\r\n \r\nI lift my heart as spring lifts up \r\nA yellow daisy to the rain; \r\nMy heart will be a lovely cup \r\nAltho\' it holds but pain. \r\n\r\nFor I shall learn from flower and leaf \r\nThat color every drop they hold, \r\nTo change the lifeless wine of grief \r\nTo living gold.\r\n\r\nCredo\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nI cannot find my way: there is no star\r\nIn all the shrouded heavens anywhere;\r\nAnd there is not a whisper in the air\r\nOf any living voice but one so far\r\nThat I can hear it only as a bar\r\nOf lost, imperial music, played when fair\r\nAnd angel fingers wove, and unaware,\r\nDead leaves to garlands where no roses are.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a glimmer, nor a call,\r\nFor one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears,\r\nThe black and awful chaos of the night;\r\nFor through it allabove, beyond it all\r\nI know the far sent message of the years,\r\nI feel the coming glory of the light.\r\n\r\nThe Waif \r\n\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nThe day is done, and the darkness\r\nFalls from the wings of Night,\r\nAs a feather is wafted downward\r\nFrom an eagle in his flight.\r\n\r\nI see the lights of the village\r\nGleam through the rain and the mist,\r\nAnd a feeling of sadness comes o\'er me\r\nThat my soul cannot resist:\r\n\r\nA feeling of sadness and longing,\r\nThat is not akin to pain,\r\nAnd resembles sorrow only\r\nAs the mist resembles the rain.\r\n\r\nCome, read to me some poem,\r\nSome simple and heartfelt lay,\r\nThat shall soothe this restless feeling,\r\nAnd banish the thoughts of day.\r\n\r\nNot from the grand old masters,\r\nNot from the bards sublime,\r\nWhose distant footsteps echo\r\nThrough the corridors of Time,\r\n\r\nFor, like strains of martial music,\r\nTheir mighty thoughts suggest\r\nLife\'s endless toil and endeavor;\r\nAnd tonight I long for rest.\r\n\r\nRead from some humbler poet,\r\nWhose songs gushed from his heart,\r\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\r\nOr tears from the eyelids start;\r\n\r\nWho, through long days of labor,\r\nAnd nights devoid of ease,\r\nStill heard in his soul the music\r\nOf wonderful melodies.\r\n\r\nSuch songs have a power to quiet\r\nThe restless pulse of care,\r\nAnd comes like the benediction\r\nThat follows after prayer.\r\n\r\nThen read from the treasured volume\r\nThe poem of thy choice,\r\nAnd lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\nThe beauty of thy voice.\r\n\r\nAnd the night shall be filled with music,\r\nAnd the cares, that infest the day,\r\nShall fold their tents, like the Arabs,\r\nAnd as silently steal away.\r\n\r\nThe Silent Slain \r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\nWe too, we too, descending once again \r\nThe hills of our own land, we too have heard \r\nFar off  Ah, que ce cor a longue haleine  \r\nThe horn of Roland in the passages of Spain, \r\nThe first, the second blast, the failing third, \r\nAnd with the third turned back and climbed once more \r\nThe steep road southward, and heard faint the sound \r\nOf swords, of horses, the disastrous war, \r\nAnd crossed the dark defile at last, and found \r\nAt Roncevaux upon the darkening plain \r\nThe dead against the dead and on the silent ground \r\nThe silent slain  \r\n\r\nBeauty That Is Never Old \r\nby James Weldon Johnson\r\n\r\nWhen buffeted and beaten by life\'s storms,\r\nWhen by the bitter cares of life oppressed,\r\nI want no surer haven than your arms,\r\nI want no sweeter heaven than your breast.\r\n\r\nWhen over my life\'s way there falls the blight\r\nOf sunless days, and nights of starless skies;\r\nEnough for me, the calm and steadfast light\r\nThat softly shines within your loving eyes.\r\n\r\nThe world, for me, and all the world can hold\r\nIs circled by your arms; for me there lies,\r\nWithin the lights and shadows of your eyes,\r\nThe only beauty that is never old.\r\n\r\nMother Night \r\nby James Weldon Johnson\r\n\r\nEternities before the first-born day,\r\nOr ere the first sun fledged his wings of flame,\r\nCalm Night, the everlasting and the same,\r\nA brooding mother over chaos lay.\r\nAnd whirling suns shall blaze and then decay,\r\nShall run their fiery courses and then claim\r\nThe haven of the darkness whence they came;\r\nBack to Nirvanic peace shall grope their way.\r\n\r\nSo when my feeble sun of life burns out,\r\nAnd sounded is the hour for my long sleep,\r\nI shall, full weary of the feverish light,\r\nWelcome the darkness without fear or doubt,\r\nAnd heavy-lidded, I shall softly creep\r\nInto the quiet bosom of the Night.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Mole\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nAvoid the reeking herd, \r\nShun the polluted flock, \r\nLive like that stoic bird, \r\nThe eagle of the rock. \r\n\r\nThe huddled warmth of crowds \r\nBegets and fosters hate; \r\nHe keeps above the clouds \r\nHis cliff inviolate. \r\n\r\nWhen flocks are folded warm, \r\nAnd herds to shelter run, \r\nHe sails above the storm, \r\nHe stares into the sun. \r\n\r\nIf in the eagle\'s track \r\nYour sinews cannot leap, \r\nAvoid the lathered pack, \r\nTurn from the steaming sheep. \r\n\r\nIf you would keep your soul \r\nFrom spotted sight or sound, \r\nLive like the velvet mole: \r\nGo burrow underground. \r\n\r\nAnd there hold intercourse \r\nWith roots of trees and stones, \r\nWith rivers at their source, \r\nAnd disembodied bones.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to T. Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\tLove Is Not All by Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof against the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and sink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breathNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making friends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be that in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor nagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love for peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I do not think I would.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressed by Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind, \r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find \r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest \r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast: \r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed, \r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, \r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason \r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain, \r\nI shall remember you with love, or season \r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain: \r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason \r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\r\nI only know that summer sang in me\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more.\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament \r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive \r\npigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Penitent \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nI had a little Sorrow,\r\n Born of a little Sin,\r\n I found a room all damp with gloom\r\nAnd shut us all within;\r\n And, Little Sorrow, weep, said I,\r\n And, Little Sin, pray God to die,\r\n And I upon the floor will lie\r\n And think how bad I\'ve been!\r\n\r\n Alas for pious planning \r\nIt mattered not a whit!\r\n As far as gloom went in that room,\r\n The lamp might have been lit!\r\n My little Sorrow would not weep,\r\n My little Sin would go to sleep \r\n To save my soul I could not keep\r\n My graceless mind on it!\r\n\r\nSo I got up in anger,\r\nAnd took a book I had,\r\n And put a ribbon on my  hair\r\n To please a passing lad,\r\nAnd, One thing there\'s no getting by \r\n I\'ve been a wicked girl, said I:\r\n But if I can\'t be sorry, why,\r\nI might as well be glad!\r\n\r\nA Supermarket in California\r\nby Allen Ginsberg\r\n\r\n What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, \r\nfor I walked down the\r\nstreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious \r\nlooking at the full moon.\r\n In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I \r\nwent into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!\r\n What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families \r\nshopping at night! Aisles\r\nfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the \r\ntomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the \r\nwatermelons?\r\n I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old \r\ngrubber, poking among the\r\nmeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\n I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the \r\npork chops? What price\r\nbananas?

and, Do I dare?\r\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\r\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\r\n[They will say: How his hair is growing thin!]\r\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\r\n[They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!]\r\nDo I dare\r\nDisturb the universe?\r\nIn a minute there is time\r\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\n For I have known them all already, known them all:\r\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\r\n So how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the eyes already, known them all-\r\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\nThen how should I begin\r\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n And how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the arms already, known them all-\r\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]\r\nIt is perfume from a dress\r\nThat makes me so digress?\r\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n And should I then presume?\r\n And how should I begin?\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .\r\n\r\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\nSmoothed by long fingers,\r\nAsleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,\r\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\nThough I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,\r\nI am no prophetand here\'s no great matter;\r\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\nTo say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\r\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n Should say: That is not what I meant at all.\r\n That is not it, at all.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\r\nfloor\r\nAnd this, and so much more?\r\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\nWould it have been worth while\r\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\r\n That is not it at all,\r\n That is not what I meant, at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nNo!

I have nothing to do with explosions.\r\nI have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses\r\nAnd my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.\r\n\r\nThey have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff\r\nLike an eye between two white lids that will not shut.\r\nStupid pupil, it has to take everything in.\r\nThe nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,\r\nThey pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,\r\nDoing things with their hands, one just the same as another,\r\nSo it is impossible to tell how many there are.\r\n\r\nMy body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water\r\nTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.\r\nThey bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.\r\nNow I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\r\nMy patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,\r\nMy husband and child smiling out of the family photo;\r\nTheir smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.\r\n\r\nI have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat\r\nstubbornly hanging on to my name and address.\r\nThey have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.\r\nScared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley\r\nI watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books\r\nSink out of sight, and the water went over my head.\r\nI am a nun now, I have never been so pure.\r\n\r\nI didnt want any flowers, I only wanted\r\nTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.\r\nHow free it is, you have no idea how free\r\nThe peacefulness is so big it dazes you,\r\nAnd it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.\r\nIt is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them\r\nShutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.\r\nEven through the gift paper I could hear them breathe\r\nLightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.\r\nTheir redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.\r\nThey are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,\r\nUpsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,\r\nA dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.\r\n\r\nNobody watched me before, now I am watched.\r\nThe tulips turn to me, and the window behind me\r\nWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,\r\nAnd I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow\r\nBetween the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,\r\nAnd I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.\r\nThe vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\r\n\r\nBefore they came the air was calm enough,\r\nComing and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.\r\nThen the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.\r\nNow the air snags and eddies round them the way a river\r\nSnags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.\r\nThey concentrate my attention, that was happy\r\nPlaying and resting without committing itself.\r\n\r\nThe walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.\r\nThe tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;\r\nThey are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,\r\nAnd I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes\r\nIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.\r\nThe water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,\r\nAnd comes from a country far away as health.\r\n\r\nYou, Andrew Marvell\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nAnd here face down beneath the sun\r\nAnd here upon earth\'s noonward height\r\nTo feel the always coming on\r\nThe always rising of the night:\r\n\r\nTo feel creep up the curving east\r\nThe earthy chill of dusk and slow\r\nUpon those under lands the vast\r\nAnd ever climbing shadow grow\r\n\r\nAnd strange at Ecbatan the trees\r\nTake leaf by leaf the evening strange\r\nThe flooding dark about their knees\r\nThe mountains over Persia change\r\n\r\nAnd now at Kermanshah the gate\r\nDark empty and the withered grass\r\nAnd through the twilight now the late\r\nFew travelers in the westward pass\r\n\r\nAnd Baghdad darken and the bridge\r\nAcross the silent river gone\r\nAnd through Arabia the edge\r\nOf evening widen and steal on\r\n\r\nAnd deepen on Palmyra\'s street\r\nThe wheel rut in the ruined stone\r\nAnd Lebanon fade out and Crete\r\nhigh through the clouds and overblown\r\n\r\nAnd over Sicily the air\r\nStill flashing with the landward gulls\r\nAnd loom and slowly disappear\r\nThe sails above the shadowy hulls\r\n\r\nAnd Spain go under and the shore\r\nOf Africa the gilded sand\r\nAnd evening vanish and no more\r\nThe low pale light across that land\r\n\r\nNor now the long light on the sea:\r\nAnd here face downward in the sun\r\nTo feel how swift how secretly\r\nThe shadow of the night comes on...\r\n\r\nMemorial Rain\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nfor Kenneth MacLeish, 1894-1918\r\n\r\nAmbassador Puser the ambassador\r\nReminds himself in French, felicitous tongue,\r\nWhat these (young men no longer) lie here for\r\nIn rows that once, and somewhere else, were young\r\n\r\nAll night in Brussels the wind had tugged at my door:\r\nI had heard the wind at my door and the trees strung\r\nTaut, and to me who had never been before\r\nIn that country it was a strange wind, blowing\r\nSteadily, stiffening the walls, the floor,\r\nThe roof of my room. I had not slept for knowing\r\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\r\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the winds flowing\r\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\r\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\r\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\r\nListening.\r\n\r\nReflects that these enjoy\r\nTheir countrys gratitude, that deep repose,\r\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\r\nThat rest, that sleep\r\n\r\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\r\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\r\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\r\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\r\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\r\nI felt him waiting.\r\n\r\nIndicates the flag\r\nWhich (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain\r\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\r\nHave made America\r\n\r\nIn the ripe grain\r\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\r\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\r\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\r\nWaitinglistening\r\n\r\nDedicates to them\r\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\r\nA Grateful country\r\n\r\nUnder the dry grass stem\r\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\r\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\r\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\r\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\r\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\r\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\r\n\r\nThe living scatter, they run into houses, the wind\r\nIs trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again\r\nTrampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned\r\nSpurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,\r\nSeeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping\r\nBetween cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:\r\nThe earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,\r\nHe rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nit is at moments after i have dreamed\r\nof the rare entertainment of your eyes,\r\nwhen(being fool to fancy)i have deemed\r\nwith your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;\r\nat moments when the glassy darkness holds\r\nthe genuine apparition of your smile\r\n(it was through tears always)and silence moulds\r\nsuch strangeness as was mine a little while;\r\nmoments when my once more illustrious arms\r\nare filled with fascination,when my breast\r\nwears the intolerant brightness of your charms:\r\none pierced moment whiter than the rest\r\nturning from the tremendous lie of sleep\r\ni watch the roses of the day grow deep.\r\n\r\nNovember Graveyard\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees\r\nHoard last year\'s leaves, won\'t mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn\r\nTo elegiac dryads, and dour grass\r\nGuards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness\r\nHowever the grandiloquent mind may scorn\r\nSuch poverty. No dead men\'s cries\r\n\r\nFlower forget-me-nots between the stones\r\nPaving this grave ground. Here\'s honest rot\r\nTo unpick the heart, pare bone\r\nFree of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton\r\nBulks real, all saints\' tongues fall quiet:\r\nFlies watch no resurrections in the sun.\r\n\r\nAt the essential landscape stare, stare\r\nTill your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:\r\nWhatever lost ghosts flare,\r\nDamned, howling in their shrouds across the moor\r\nRave on the leash of the starving mind\r\nWhich peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air.\r\n\r\nBarren Woman\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nEmpty, I echo to the least footfall,\r\nMuseum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.\r\nIn my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,\r\nNun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies\r\nExhale their pallor like scent.\r\n\r\nI imagine myself with a great public,\r\nMother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.\r\nInstead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.\r\nThe moon lays a hand on my forehead,\r\nBlank-faced and mum as a nurse.\r\n\r\nI Am Vertical\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nBut I would rather be horizontal.\r\nI am not a tree with my root in the soil\r\nSucking up minerals and motherly love\r\nSo that each March I may gleam into leaf, \r\nNor am I the beauty of a garden bed\r\nAttracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted, \r\nUnknowing I must soon unpetal.\r\nCompared with me, a tree is immortal\r\nAnd a flower-head not tall, but more startling, \r\nAnd I want the one\'s longevity and the other\'s daring.\r\n\r\nTonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars, \r\nThe trees and the flowers have been strewing their cool odors.\r\nI walk among them, but none of them are noticing.\r\nSometimes I think that when I am sleeping \r\nI must most perfectly resemble them \r\nThoughts gone dim.\r\nIt is more natural to me, lying down.\r\nThen the sky and I are in open conversation, \r\nAnd I shall be useful when I lie down finally:\r\nThen the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
