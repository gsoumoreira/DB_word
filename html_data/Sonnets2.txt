So if you disagree with my choices, \r\nplease feel free to compile your own. \r\n\r\nMy top ten writers of sonnets are: Conrad Aiken, Louise Bogan, e. e. cummings, \r\nRobert Frost, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Percy Bysshe \r\nShelley, William Butler Yeats, William Wordsworth and Sir Thomas Wyatt. \r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable mentions go to William Blake, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert \r\nBurns, John Clare, Hart Crane, Emily \r\nDickinson, John Donne, Ernest Dowson, Thomas Hardy, Robert Hayden, Seamus \r\nHeaney, Langston Hughes, John Keats, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Lowell, John Milton, Wilfred Owen, \r\nE. A. Robinson, Christina Rossetti, Edmund Spenser, Wallace Stevens, Dylan \r\nThomas, Edward Thomas and Richard Wilbur. \r\n\r\nOne interesting thing about my personal canon is that many of the poems are fairly recent. This \r\nleads me to believe the death of poetry has been greatly exaggerated. \r\nAnother interesting thing is where Shakespeare ranks; I believe a number of \r\nother poets wrote better sonnets than the Bard of Avon. For my \r\npurposes here, I will define the term sonnet according to its original meaning \r\nof little song, concentrating on poems of around fourteen lines, give or take.\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\r\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\r\npass into nothingness ...\r\nJohn Keats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nThe Most Beautiful Poems in the English Language\r\n\r\nBread and Musicby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nIn his best poems Conrad Aiken rivals Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \r\na master of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s Bread and Music is one of my \r\nvery favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is another of my favorite \r\npoems from the early days of English poetry. I chose to translate it myself, to make \r\nit more accessible to modern readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \r\nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, \r\nproper and homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \r\nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous for his \r\ndisdain for dull and dulling conformity, as his witty epigrams prove. But the \r\nlovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that he was also a true poet, \r\ncreating timeless art. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \r\npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne made her almost as famous. The Wild Swans \r\nat Coole, is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \r\nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. She is best know as a poet \r\nfor her Sonnets from the Portuguese. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nIn poems like Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night, In My Craft or Sullen \r\nArt and Fern Hill the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas ranks with any poet who ever \r\nwrote in English. \r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the Masters page of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind, \r\nlist=desires\r\nBut as for me, h\xe9las, I may no more. h\xe9las=alas\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSithens in a net I seek to hold the wind. Sithens=Since\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am, \r\nNoli me tangere=Touch me not\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Bible, Jesus told Mary Magdalene not to touch him when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. It is possible that Thomas Wyatt [1503-1542] wrote this poem about \r\nAnne Boleyn, who became untouchable when King Henry VIII claimed her for \r\nhimself. In ancient times, men could be executed for hunting \r\nthe king\'s deer. (Robin Hood was famously pursued by the Sherriff of Nottingham \r\nfor poaching the king\'s deer.) If Wyatt\'s lover quoted Jesus, instructing the \r\npoet not to touch her, this suggests that there may have been religious reasons for him \r\nto abandon her \r\npursuit. Perhaps when Ann Boleyn pledged her troth to Henry, she  \r\ndeclared herself untouchable because her vows were not only to her King, but \r\nalso to \r\nher God. \r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nRobert Hayden is probably an unknown or undervalued poet to most readers today, \r\nbut every reader should be intimately familiar with this wonderful poem. Those \r\nWinter Sundays illustrates how one poem can make a poet immortal. I may never \r\nremember another poem by Hayden, but I will certainly never forget this one.\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn (circa 658-680 AD)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow let us honour heaven-kingdom\'s Guardian,\r\nthe might of the Architect and his mind-plans,\r\nthe work of the Glory-Father. First he, the \r\neternal Lord,\r\nestablished the foundation of wonders.\r\nThen he, the Primeval Poet, created heaven as a roof\r\nfor the sons of men, holy Creator,\r\nMaker of mankind. Then he, the Everlasting Entity,\r\nafterwards made men middle-earth: Master almighty!\r\n\r\nC\xe6dmon\'s Hymn is the first English poem, or at least the oldest \r\nextant English poem. It was composed sometime between 658 and 680 AD. According to the \r\nVenerable Bede (673-735), C\xe6dmon was an illiterate herdsman who was given the \r\ngift of poetic composition by an angel. In the original poem, hardly a word is \r\nrecognizable as English. C\xe6dmon was writing in a somewhat Anglicized form of \r\nancient German. The word England harkens back to Angle-land; the Angles were a \r\nGermanic tribe. Nevertheless, by C\xe6dmon\'s time the foundations of English poetry \r\nwere being laid, particularly in the areas of accentual meter and alliteration.\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep \r\nmonotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard \r\ndaylight steer.\r\n\r\nI can\'t remember where I first read The Death of a Toad by Richard Wilbur, but \r\nit haunted me until I finally rediscovered it many years later, flipping through \r\nthe pages of a poetry anthology in a bookstore. I had forgotten the poem\'s title and \r\nits poet\'s name, but I had never been able to forget its words\' magic. So I am \r\nplacing it high on this page, wanting to make sure other readers are able to enjoy what I \r\nmissed for so many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Distant Light\r\n\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBitterly cold,\r\nwinter clings to the naked trees.\r\n\r\nIf only you would free\r\nthe bright sparrows\r\nfrom your fingertips\r\nand release a smilethat shy, tentative smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned anguish I see.\r\n\r\nSing! Can we not sing\r\nas if we were warm, hand-in-hand,\r\nsheltered by shade from a sweltering sun?\r\n\r\nCan you not always remain like this:\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than expected, in reverie?\r\n\r\nDarkness increases and we must remain vigilant\r\nnow that this distant light is our sole consolation ...\r\nthis imperiled flame, which from the beginning\r\nhas constantly flickered,\r\nin danger of going out.\r\n\r\nCome to me, closer and closer.\r\nI dont want to be able to tell my hand from yours.\r\nAnd lets stay awake, lest the snow smother us.\r\n\r\nWalid Khazindar was born in 1950 in Gaza City. He is considered one of the \r\nvery best Palestinian poets; his poetry \r\nhas been said to be characterized by metaphoric originality and a novel thematic approach unprecedented in Arabic poetry. He was awarded the first Palestine Prize for Poetry in 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels than for his poetry, but Piano \r\nis an immortal poem, and thus makes Lawrence an immortal poet.\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n   \r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n \r\n   \r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n \r\n   \r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson\'s influence on T. S. Eliot is obvious, and anyone who reads his \r\nbest poems can easily understand the attraction. Other writers unabashedly \r\nborrowed phrases from Dowson: gone with the wind, the days of wine and \r\nroses, hollow lands, etc. The best poets write memorable lines, and Dowson\'s \r\nbest poems are full of memorable lines. \r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTea at the Palaz of Hoon\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nNot less because in purple I descended\r\nThe western day through what you called\r\nThe loneliest air, not less was I myself.\r\n\r\nWhat was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?\r\nWhat were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?\r\nWhat was the sea whose tide swept through me there?\r\n\r\nOut of my mind the golden ointment rained,\r\nAnd my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.\r\nI was myself the compass of that sea:\r\n\r\nI was the world in which I walked, and what I saw\r\nOr heard or felt came not but from myself;\r\nAnd there I found myself more truly and more strange.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens is one of the very best modern poets, if not the best. My \r\nfavorites among his poems include Sunday Morning, The Snow Man, The Man \r\nWhose Pharynx Was Bad and Tea at the Palaz of Hoon. Some of his poems seem \r\noverly obscure to me, and I find it hard to understand why anyone likes (or \r\npretends to like) his jar in Tennessee stuff, but for sheer music and the \r\nbeauty of words, Stevens is hard to beat. Several of his poems can be found on \r\nthe \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nTom Moore was an Irish tenor, songwriter and poet; this wonderfully haunting poem \r\ndemonstrates his virtuosity as a poet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nJuan\'s Song\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nWhen beauty breaks and falls asunder\r\nI feel no grief for it, but wonder.\r\nWhen love, like a frail shell, lies broken,\r\nI keep no chip of it for token.\r\nI never had a man for friend\r\nWho did not know that love must end.\r\nI never had a girl for lover\r\nWho could discern when love was over.\r\nWhat the wise doubt, the fool believes\r\nWho is it, then, that love deceives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin Just-by e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nin Just-\r\nspring when the world is mud-\r\nluscious the little\r\nlame baloonman\r\n\r\nwhistles far and wee\r\n\r\nand eddieandbill come\r\nrunning from marbles and\r\npiracies and it\'s\r\nspring\r\n\r\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\r\n\r\nthe queer\r\nold baloonman whistles\r\nfar and wee\r\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\r\n\r\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\r\nit\'s\r\nspring\r\nand\r\n\r\n the\r\ngoat-footed\r\n\r\nbaloonMan whistles\r\nfar\r\nand\r\nwee\r\n\r\nE. E. Cummings (or e. e. cummings) has long been one of my favorite poets. I \r\nlove his musicality, his whimsy, and his defiance of convention. In his darker \r\npoems like I sing of Olaf, glad and big, I love his fierce wrath against \r\ninjustice. In my opinion he is one of the major poets of the modern era.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the Masters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nJerusalem\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\r\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\r\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\r\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\r\n\r\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\r\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\r\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\r\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\r\n\r\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\r\nBring me my arrows of desire:\r\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\r\nBring me my chariot of fire.\r\n\r\nI will not cease from mental fight,\r\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\r\nTill we have built Jerusalem\r\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\r\n\r\nCradle Songby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n \r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n \r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n \r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\nCradle Song by William Blake is one of the most touching, most moving poems in \r\nthe English language. It is probably the best lullaby in the English language, \r\nalong with Lullaby by W. H. Auden. Blake wrote a number of truly great poems, \r\nseveral of which can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\nThe Tide Rises, The Tide Falls\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide rises, the tide falls,\r\nThe twilight darkens, the curlew calls;\r\nAlong the sea-sands damp and brown\r\nThe traveller hastens toward the town,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nDarkness settles on roofs and walls,\r\nBut the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;\r\nThe little waves, with their soft, white hands,\r\nEfface the footprints in the sands,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nThe morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls\r\nStamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;\r\nThe day returns, but nevermore\r\nReturns the traveller to the shore,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nThe Cross of Snow\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nIn the long, sleepless watches of the night,\r\nA gentle facethe face of one long dead\r\nLooks at me from the wall, where round its head\r\nThe night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.\r\nHere in this room she died; and soul more white\r\nNever through martyrdom of fire was led\r\nTo its repose; nor can in books be read\r\nThe legend of a life more benedight.\r\nThere is a mountain in the distant West\r\nThat, sun-defying, in its deep ravines\r\nDisplays a cross of snow upon its side.\r\nSuch is the cross I wear upon my breast\r\nThese eighteen years, through all the changing scenes\r\nAnd seasons, changeless since the day she died.\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow rivaled Alfred Lord Tennyson for the mantle of the \r\nmost popular poet of their day. While Longfellow\'s reputation has diminished \r\nsomewhat (or perhaps more than somewhat), it\'s hard to say why. His best poems \r\nare wonderfully melodic and evocative, as the two poems above demonstrate. \r\n\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the \r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman is one of the most important poets of all time, not only because \r\nhis best poems are masterpieces, but because of his influence on other poets, \r\nand on the American psyche. A Noiseless Patient Spider is a wonderfully \r\nmystical poem by America\'s Merlin. You can find a number of his poems on the\r\nMasters page of\r\nThe HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nEzra Pound is not one of my favorite poets, but this poem is a wonderful \r\nminiature of English society, captured in a poem for the ages.\r\n\r\nI - Easter Hymn\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousman could \r\nwrite movingly without indulging in images, melodrama or sophistry, and rivals \r\nShakespeare in what he could accomplish with direct statement. Housman is \r\ncertainly a major poet, and one of our very best critics of society and \r\nreligion, along with Blake, Twain and Wilde. A good number of his poems can be \r\nfound on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\nThomas Hardy wrote a number of truly great poems, including The Darkling \r\nThrush, The Convergence of the Twain and Channel Firing.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\nJohn Donne wrote some of the sexiest poems in the English language, and some of \r\nthe best devotional poems as well. Talk about range!\r\n\r\nSometimes Mysteriously\r\n\r\nby Luis Omar Salinas\r\n\r\nSometimes in the evening when love\r\ntunes its harp and the crickets\r\ncelebrate life, I am like a troubadour\r\nin search of friends, loved ones,\r\nanyone who will share with me\r\na bit of conversation. My loneliness\r\narrives ghostlike and pretentious,\r\nit seeks my soul, it is ravenous\r\nand hurting. I admire my father\r\nwho always has advice in these matters,\r\nbut a game of chess won\'t do, or\r\nthe frivolity of religion.\r\nI want to find a solution, so I\r\nwrite letters, poems, and sometimes\r\nI touch solitude on the shoulder\r\nand surrender to a great tranquility.\r\nI understand I need courage\r\nand sometimes, mysteriously,\r\nI feel whole.\r\n\r\nLuis Omar Salinas is generally considered to be one of the very best Hispanic \r\npoets to write in English, with good cause. Sometimes Mysteriously is one of \r\nthose mysterious poems that sometimes makes us feel a special kinship with the \r\npoet. \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley was one of the great Romantics who died many, many years \r\nbefore his time. His touch with meter and rhyme was exquisite.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nLeda and the Swan\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\r\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\r\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\r\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\r\n\r\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\r\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\r\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\r\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\r\n\r\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\r\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\r\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\r\n \r\nBeing so caught up,\r\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\r\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\r\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats is probably the last of the great Romantics, and the first of the \r\ngreat Modernists. He wrote a good number of truly great poems, and remains an \r\nessential poet of the highest rank. Other poems of his that I especially love \r\ninclude An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, The Wild Swans at Coole and \r\nLeda and the Swan. \r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was one of the early romantics (perhaps a forerunner of both \r\nShelley and Clare), and one of my early favorites along with Blake and Housman. \r\nHe still reads well today, I think. He is, of course, most famous for his \r\nnostalgic drinking song Auld Lang Syne. Several of his poems can be found on \r\nthe \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti wrote a handful of immortal poems, and that makes her an \r\nimmortal poet. \r\nTwo of her poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Her Surgery\r\nby Jack Butler\r\n\r\nI\r\nOver the city the moon rides in mist,\r\nscrim scarred with faint rainbow.\r\nTwo days till Easter.The thin clouds run slow, slow,\r\nthe wind bells bleed the quietest\r\nof possible musics to the dark lawn.\r\nAll possibility we will have children is gone.\r\n\r\nII\r\nI raise a glass half water, half alcohol,\r\nto that light come full again.\r\nInside, you sleep, somewhere below the pain.\r\nDown at the river, there is a tall\r\nghost tossing flowers to dark water\r\njessamine, rose, and daisy, salvia lyrata . . .\r\n\r\nIII\r\nOh goodbye, goodbye to bloom in the white blaze\r\nof moon on the river, goodbye\r\nto creek joining the creek joining the river, the axil, the Y,\r\ngoodbye to the Yes of two Ifs in one phrase . . .\r\nChildren bear children. We are grown,\r\nand time has thrown us free under the timeless moon.\r\n\r\nJack Butler is one of my favorite contemporary poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not Allby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof \r\nagainst the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and \r\nsink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath\r\nNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making \r\nfriends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be \r\nthat in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor \r\nnagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love \r\nfor peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I \r\ndo not think I would.\r\n\r\nOnly until this cigarette is ended\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nOnly until this cigarette is ended,\r\nA little moment at the end of all,\r\nWhile on the floor the quiet ashes fall,\r\nAnd in the firelight to a lance extended,\r\nBizarrely with the jazzing music blended,\r\nThe broken shadow dances on the wall,\r\nI will permit my memory to recall\r\nThe vision of you, by all my dreams attended.\r\nAnd then adieu,farewell!the dream is done.\r\nYours is a face of which I can forget\r\nThe color and the features, every one,\r\nThe words not ever, and the smiles not yet;\r\nBut in your day this moment is the sun\r\nUpon a hill, after the sun has set.\r\n\r\nMillay is not just another penner of sonnets. Her sonnets sparkle with life and \r\nlust amid the foreshadowing of death. She also has an interesting quality of \r\nresolve: she seems willing to give herself to men, but not to give herself away. \r\nIf she is playing games, she is playing them knowingly, and probably understands \r\nthe rules better than her partners.\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nTichborne\'s elegy to himself remains one of the best and most powerful in the \r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMouse\'s Nest\r\n\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\r\nAnd progged it as I passed and went away;\r\nAnd when I looked I fancied something stirred,\r\nAnd turned again and hoped to catch the bird \r\nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheats\r\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats;\r\nShe looked so odd and so grotesque to me,\r\nI ran and wondered what the thing could be,\r\nAnd pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood;\r\nThen the mouse hurried from the craking brood.\r\nThe young ones squeaked, and as I went away\r\nShe found her nest again among the hay.\r\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\r\nAnd broad old cesspools glittered in the sun.\r\n\r\nJohn Clare, while perhaps not a Romantic poet in the style of Shelley and Keats, \r\nwas a Romantic inasmuch as he could get down and dirty with the best of them. \r\nHe may be the direct ancestor of poets like Robinson Jeffers, who wrote \r\ntruthfully about nature and seemed to scorn sheen in poetry.\r\n\r\nThe Windhoverby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nG. M. Hopkins did things with the language no poet before or since has done, or \r\nat least not as well and to the same extent. His influence can be seen in the \r\nwork of Dylan Thomas, but no one has ever duplicated his rhythms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\nWylie\'s poem reminds me of Clare, and of D. H. Lawrence\'s snake, and also of \r\nRichard Wilbur\'s tour-de-force, The Death of a Toad. And yet her poem is \r\nwholly unique and original.\r\n\r\nCargoes\r\nby John Masefield \r\n\r\n\r\nQuinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir,\r\nRowing home to haven in sunny Palestine,\r\nWith a cargo of ivory,\r\nAnd apes and peacocks,\r\nSandalwood, cedarwood, and sweet white wine.\r\n\r\nStately Spanish galleon coming from the Isthmus, \r\n\r\nDipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of diamonds,\r\nEmeralds, amethysts,\r\nTopazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores.\r\n\r\nDirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack, \r\n\r\nButting through the Channel in the mad March days, \r\n\r\nWith a cargo of Tyne coal,\r\nRoad-rails, pig-lead,\r\nFirewood, iron-ware, and cheap tin trays.\r\n\r\nJohn Masefield contrasts three freighters from three very different empires \r\nand times, and manages to tell us much about each entirely through contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bishop wrote a small handful of truly great poems such as One Art, \r\nThe Fish and The Armadillo, and can probably be considered a major poet as a \r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope Is A Thing With Feathersby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nHope is a thing with feathers\r\nThat perches in the soul\r\nAnd sings a tune without words\r\nAnd never stops at all.\r\n\r\nAnd sweetest, in the gale, is heard\r\nAnd sore must be the storm\r\nThat could abash the little bird\r\nThat keeps so many warm.\r\n\r\nIve heard it in the chilliest land\r\nAnd on the strangest sea\r\nYet, never, in extremity\r\nIt ask a crumb of me.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson is undoubtedly a major poet, although I\'ve always had a \r\npreference for the music of words and her poems are purposefully less \r\nmellifluous.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides . . . High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\n\r\nVoyages, Part I\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nAbove the fresh ruffles of the surf\r\nBright striped urchins flay each other with sand. \r\n\r\nThey have contrived a conquest for shell shucks, \r\n\r\nAnd their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed \r\n\r\nGaily digging and scattering.\r\n\r\nAnd in answer to their treble interjections \r\n\r\nThe sun beats lightning on the waves,\r\nThe waves fold thunder on the sand;\r\nAnd could they hear me I would tell them: \r\n\r\n\r\nO brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,\r\nFondle your shells and sticks, bleached\r\nBy time and the elements; but there is a line \r\n\r\nYou must not cross nor ever trust beyond it \r\n\r\nSpry cordage of your bodies to caresses\r\nToo lichen-faithful from too wide a breast. \r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea is cruel.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Hart Crane\'s Voyages in full is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. Since this is a page of sonnets I have \r\nlimited myself to the opening lines only. Other poems of Crane\'s such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower \r\nalso rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language.\r\n\r\nTime in Eternity\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nWhen you were as an angel in my arms,\r\nHad laid your bare head just below my chin,\r\nYour length pressed up to mine, entrusting charms\r\nMy whole youth\'s starward longing could not win;\r\nWith still the murmur of your love in me,\r\nMiracle-tones of all my lifelong hope,\r\nI wished that there might start eternity\r\nAnd seal forever that sweet envelope;\r\nAnd as it did, my thoughts are now for you\r\nAs every star is blotted by the sun,\r\nAnd so the sun itself\r\nHas perished too,\r\nAnd with it, every dream of mine\r\nBut one.\r\n\r\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost Ship\r\nby \r\nA. E. Stallings\r\n\r\nShe plies an inland sea. Dull\r\nWith rust, scarred by a jagged reef.\r\nIn Cyrillic, on her hull\r\nIs lettered, Grief.\r\n\r\nThe dim stars do not signify;\r\nNo sonar with its eerie ping\r\nSounds the depthsshe travels by\r\nDead reckoning.\r\n\r\nAt her heart is a stopped clock.\r\nIn her wake, the hours drag.\r\nThere is no port where she can dock,\r\nShe flies no flag,\r\n\r\nHas no allegiance to a state,\r\nNo registry, no harbor berth,\r\nNowhere to discharge her freight\r\nUpon the earth.\r\n\r\nA. E. Stallings is a contemporary poet who\'s making a name for herself, and \r\nleaving her mark on the world in the form of memorable poems.\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen is a war poet without peer, and one of the first great modern \r\npoets. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est is probably the best anti-war poem in the \r\nEnglish language, perhaps in any language. If man ever grows wise enough as a \r\nspecies to abolish war, Wilfred Owen\'s voice, echoed in thousands of other poems \r\nand songs, will have been a major catalyst.\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nHerrick is pleasing to the ear, and should continue to be read.\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose\r\nby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nThis a near-perfect poem that still reads well today.\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\nI\'m not normally a Poe buff, but I like this mystical chant.\r\n\r\nSea Fevers\r\nby Agnes Wathall\r\n\r\nNo ancient mariner I,\r\n Hawker of public crosses,\r\nSnaring the passersby\r\n With my necklace of albatrosses.\r\n\r\nI blink no glittering eye\r\n Between tufts of gray sea mosses\r\nNor in the high road ply\r\n My trade of guilts and glosses.\r\n\r\nBut a dark and inward sky\r\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\r\nNo more becalmed to lie,\r\n The skeleton ship tosses.\r\n\r\nAgnes Wathall is an unknown poet today, but this poem deserves to be read, and remembered.\r\n\r\nSonnet 147\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\r\n For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\r\n\r\nI\'m not a huge fan of Shakespeare\'s sonnets, but this one is too good to leave out. I also love a number of his songs, such as Full \r\nFathom Five:\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton\'s Defense of Carnality\r\nby Jack Foley\r\n\r\nTruly I have lost weight, I have lost weight,\r\ngrown lean in loves defense,\r\nin loves defense grown grave.\r\nIt was concupiscence that brought me to the state:\r\nall bone and a bit of skin\r\nto keep the bone within.\r\nFlesh is no heavy burden for one possessed of little\r\nand accustomed to its loss.\r\nI lean to love, which leaves me lean, till lean turn into lack.\r\nA wanton bone, I sing my song\r\nand travel where the bone is blown\r\nand extricate true love from lust\r\nas any man of wisdom must.\r\nThen wherefore should I rage\r\nagainst this pilgrimage\r\nfrom gravel unto gravel?\r\nCircuitous I travel\r\nfrom love to lack / and lack to lack,\r\nfrom lean to lack\r\nand back.\r\n\r\nJack Foley is a contemporary poet, and a damn good one.\r\n\r\nDu\r\nby Janet Kenny\r\n\r\nA wisp of old woman,\r\ncurved like a scythe,\r\ntottered to me as she\r\nfussed her shopping,\r\nher walking stick hooked\r\non her chopstick wrist.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to me then\r\nin a dried leaf voice.\r\nInaudible there\r\nin that busy street,\r\nswept by rude gales\r\nfrom passing trucks.\r\n\r\nI leaned closer to hear:\r\nMein eyes not gut.\r\ntime for bus, ven comes it?\r\nWhich bus do you want?\r\n\r\nShe smiled, shook her head\r\nthen sang to herself\r\nand somebody else,\r\ninnot German. Yiddish?\r\nWhich bus?\r\nShe leaned towards me,\r\nher tiny claw reached\r\nto stroke my face.\r\nDu she said.\r\n\r\nDu\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem by a contemporary poet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n\r\nby Ann Drysdale\r\n\r\nThe print of a bare foot, the second toe\r\nA little longer than the one which is\r\nTraditionally designated great.\r\nPraxiteles would have admired it.\r\n\r\nYou must have left in haste; your last wet step\r\nBefore boarding your suit and setting sail,\r\nOutlined in talcum on the bathroom floor\r\nMocks your habitual fastidiousness.\r\n\r\nThere is no tide here to obliterate\r\nYour oversight. Unless I wipe or sweep\r\nOr suck it up, it will not go away.\r\nThe thought delights me. I will keep the footprint.\r\n\r\nToo slight, too simply human to be called\r\nToken or promise; I am keeping it\r\nBecause it is a precious evidence\r\nThat on this island I am not alone.\r\n\r\nAnn Drysdale is one of our better contemporary poets, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nOther notable penners of sonnets include: Matthew Arnold, W. H. Auden, John \r\nBerryman, Robert Bridges, Rupert Brooke, Robert Browning, Lord Byron, Geoffrey \r\nChaucer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Billy Collins, Dante, Michael Drayton, George \r\nGascoigne, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Gray, Fulke Greville (Lord Brooke), George \r\nHerbert, Robert Herrick, Geoffrey Hill, Henry Howard (the Earl of Surrey), King \r\nJames I, Ben Jonson, Emma Lazarus, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, George Meredith, \r\nPetrarch, Edgar Allan Poe, Ezra Pound, Sir Walter Ralegh, Rilke, Dante Gabriel \r\nRossetti, Sir Philip Sidney, Charlotte Smith, Robert Southey, Edmund Spenser, \r\nAlgernon Charles Swinburne, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Edmund Waller, Oscar Wilde, \r\nLady Mary Wroth, Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nContemporary sonneteers of note include Jack Butler, Jared Carter, Alfred Dorn, \r\nAnn Drysdale, Rhina Espaillat, Annie Finch, Dana Gioia, Anthony Hecht, Mark \r\nJarman, Janet Kenny, Philip Larkin, Tom Merrill, Robert Mezey, Richard Moore, A. \r\nE. Stallings and Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best sonnets ever, at least according to me. I\'m sure every \r\nreader\'s choices will be different, but if you added a poem or three to yours, \r\nhaving read mine, hopefully you will consider your time here well spent.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Pages: The \r\nBest Antinatalist Poems and Prose\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
