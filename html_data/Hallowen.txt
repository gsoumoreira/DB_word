The \r\nchildren in our neighborhood call our house the Halloween House and it has \r\nbeen on the front page of the local newspaper in the past. I wrote the poem \r\nabove to go with the ghoulish picture. It is a bit spooky to \r\nconsider that one day we will all be skeletons! \r\n\r\nThe Witch\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nher fingers draw into claws \r\nshe cackles through rotting teeth ... \r\nu ask are there witches? \r\n \r\npshaw! \r\n\r\n(yet she has my belief)\r\n\r\nWhich poets wrote the best Halloween poems of all time?\r\nHere you will find the great medieval ballad about \r\nmadness, Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song, Alfred Noyes\'s bleakly romantic ghost story The \r\nHighwayman, Ernest Dowson\'s haunting A Last Word, Walter de la Mare\'s \r\nenigmatic The Listeners, and a terrifying poem about the specter of hell \r\nterrorizing Christian children, Robert Frost\'s magnificent Directive. I chose \r\nthe first two poems to complement our ghoulish skeleton.

Leigh Hunt \r\nlater recollected how Keats would often look at his \r\nhand and remark with dismay that it was the hand of a fifty-year-old, even \r\nthough he was only half that age. In The Fall of HyperionKeats had \r\nalready foreseen the moment When this warm scribe my hand is in the \r\ngrave.Now, toward the end of his life, Keats jots down an untitled fragment in \r\nthe middle of a comedic poem that he never finishes, The Caps and Bells; or, \r\nThe Jealousies. And Keats is still reaching out to us today, with those tragic, \r\nearnestly grasping words, reminding us with hismemento mori that we \r\nall face the same dismal fate, and that nothing can save us, just as no one was \r\nable to save or help him ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERROR TRIVIA: Speaking of skeletons, did you know that the movie The \r\nNightmare Before Christmas is based on a poem that Tim Burton wrote in \r\n1982, while he was working for Walt Disney Feature Animation? The concept stuck \r\nwith Burton and he eventually turned the poem into the 1993 stop-motion animated \r\nfeature film. Disney thought the movie was too scary for kids and released it \r\nthrough its Touchstone Pictures label. The movie Braveheart was also based on a poem, \r\nthis one \r\nwritten by a poet called Blind Harry: The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant \r\nCampioun Schir William Wallace. Or in modern English The Acts and Deeds \r\nof the Illustrious and Valiant Sir William Wallace. And there are several excellent \r\nperformances of my favorite ghost story, The Highwayman, on YouTube. There is \r\na link to one of them a few poems down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known\r\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\nTwine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader, provides a very spooky reading of \r\nEdgar Allan Poe\'s famous poem The Raven ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpirits of the Dead\r\nby\r\nEdgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\nThy soul shall find itself alone\r\nMid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone;\r\nNot one, of all the crowd, to pry\r\nInto thine hour of secrecy.\r\n\r\nBe silent in that solitude,\r\nWhich is not loneliness  for then\r\nThe spirits of the dead, who stood\r\nIn life before thee, are again\r\nIn death around thee, and their will\r\nShall overshadow thee; be still.\r\n\r\nThe night, though clear, shall frown,\r\nAnd the stars shall not look down\r\nFrom their high thrones in the Heaven\r\nWith light like hope to mortals given,\r\nBut their red orbs, without beam,\r\nTo thy weariness shall seem\r\nAs a burning and a fever\r\nWhich would cling to thee for ever.\r\n\r\nNow are thoughts thou shalt not banish,\r\nNow are visions neer to vanish;\r\nFrom thy spirit shall they pass\r\nNo more, like dew-drop from the grass.\r\n\r\nThe breeze, the breath of God, is still,\r\nAnd the mist upon the hill\r\nShadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,\r\nIs a symbol and a token.\r\nHow it hangs upon the trees,\r\nA mystery of mysteries!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vampire\'s Spa Day Dream\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nO, to swim in vats of blood! \r\nI wish I could, I wish I could! \r\nO, \'twould be \r\nso heavenly \r\nto swim in lovely vats of blood! \r\n\r\nThe poem above was inspired by a Josh Parkinson depiction of Elizabeth Bathory \r\nup to her nostrils in the blood of her victims, with their skulls floating in \r\nthe background. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe Very Afraid...\r\nby M. C. Langford\r\n\r\nThey live in a lonely place,\r\na hidden space,\r\nno human trace.\r\n\r\nThey live at a slower pace\r\nin their mountain base\r\nfar from grace. \r\n\r\nNo one is even aware\r\nthey\'re lurking there; \r\nthey dont share.\r\n\r\nGet too close, just beware\r\nyoull feel a glare,\r\na living nightmare.\r\n\r\nGet caught up in their wake\r\nand they will take \r\nlike a starving snake.\r\n\r\nIf you feel a slight quake\r\na belly ache,\r\ndont mistake.\r\n\r\nThey survive in a lonely place,\r\na scary space,\r\nin dark disgrace.\r\n\r\nNever will you see their face,\r\nbefore they displace\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\nM. C. Langford is a writer of poems and short stories, and she has also tried \r\nher hand at a couple of novels. She has written and illustrated two children\'s \r\nbooks and is now working on a third. She is also a photographer who prefers \r\nlandscapes and animals as her subjects. She is originally from a small Missouri \r\ntown and now lives in a small Tennessee town. She has been an artist and poet \r\nfor most of her life, and has a degree in graphic design. This is her advice to \r\nother writers and artists: Before my car accident, I was an engineering/survey \r\ntech, which involved drawing of a different kind. The math drove me crazy \r\nbecause I am extremely right-brained. I was told not to go to college but I did \r\nanyway, twice. I maintained a high GPA and made the Dean\'s List and a National \r\nHonor Society. I proved them wrong, so don\'t ever sell yourself short!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\'s something you don\'t see every day: just in time for Halloween, a vampire \r\npoem that I wrote many years ago has gone viral ... on a French website ... in \r\nan Anglais book ... read by someone with a burry Scottish voice! So we have an \r\nAmerican poet, a Scottish performer, an English book, and\r\na French bookstore website. The poem is its own ecumenical movement!

Burch (the \r\npoem appears below in the text version).\r\nVampires\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nVampires are such fragile creatures;\r\nwe dread the dark, but the light destroys them ...\r\nsunlight, or a stake, or a crosssuch common things.\r\nStill, late at night, when the bat-like vampire sings,\r\nwe shrink from his voice.\r\nCenturies have taught us:\r\nin shadows danger lurks for those who stray,\r\nand there the vampire bares his yellow fangs\r\nand feels the ancient soul-tormenting pangs.\r\nHe has no choice.\r\nWe are his prey, plump and fragrant,\r\nand if we pray to avoid him, he earnestly prays to find us ...\r\nprays to some despotic hooded God\r\nwhose benediction is the humid blood\r\nhe lusts to taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUlalume [an excerpt]\r\nby Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\nThe skies they were ashen and sober;\r\nThe leaves they were crisped and sere\r\nThe leaves they were withering and sere;\r\nIt was night in the lonesome October\r\nOf my most immemorial year:\r\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\nIn the misty mid region of Weir\r\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\nIn the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir ...\r\n\r\nJeff Buckley provides a haunting reading of Ulalume ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenge of the Halloween Monsters\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe Halloween monsters, incensed,\r\nkeep howling, and may be UNFENCED!!! \r\nTheyre angry that children with treats\r\nkeep throwing their trash IN THE STREETS!!!\r\n\r\nYou can check it out on your computer:\r\nGoogle says, Please dont be a POLLUTER!!!\r\nThe Halloween monsters agree,\r\nso if youre a litterbug, FLEE!!!\r\n\r\nKids, if youd like more treats next year\r\nand dont want to cower in FEAR,\r\nplease make all the mean monsters happy,\r\nand theyll hand out sweet treats like theyre sappy!\r\n\r\nSo if you eat treats on the drag\r\nand don\'t want huge monsters to nag,\r\nplease put all loose trash in your BAG!!!\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you recite the poem, get the kids to huddle up close, then yell the \r\nall-caps parts like youre one of the unhappy monsters, and perhaps goose them \r\nas well. They\'ll get the message. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a very entertaining poem, performed by its author John Beaton, about a skeleton with a highly unusual method of attacking its victims ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is Alfred Noyes\' haunting ghost story The Highwayman recited \r\nand performed in a very \r\nentertaining and well-done video ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text of The Highwayman appears later on this page. This was my \r\nfavorite poem as a young boy; my mother would recite it to me and my sisters \r\nfrom memory. I later learned that Alfred Noyes died the year I was born, 1958. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s Halloween! \r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\nIf evening falls\r\non graveyard walls\r\nfar softer than a sigh;\r\nif shadows fly\r\nthe sickled sky,\r\nwhile children toss their heads\r\nuneasy in their beds,\r\nbeware the witch\'s eye! \r\nIf goblins loom\r\nwithin the gloom\r\ntill playful pups grow terse;\r\nif birds give up their verse\r\nto comfort chicks they nurse,\r\nwhile children dream weird dreams\r\nof ugly, wiggly things,\r\nbeware the serpent\'s curse! \r\nIf spirits scream\r\nin haunted dreams\r\nwhile ancient sibyls rise\r\nto plague black nightmare skies\r\none night without disguise,\r\nwhile children toss about\r\nuneasy, full of doubt,\r\nbeware the devil\'s eyes . . . \r\nit\'s Halloween!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Hallows Night\r\nby\r\nLizette Woodworth Reese\r\n\r\nTwo things I did on Hallows Night:\r\nMade my house April-clear;\r\nLeft open wide my door\r\nTo the ghosts of the year.\r\n\r\nThen one came in. Across the room\r\nIt stood up long and fair\r\nThe ghost that was myself\r\nAnd gave me stare for stare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite in the shadows\r\nI see your face,\r\nunbidden. Go, tell\r\n\r\nLove it is commonplace;\r\ntell Regret it is not so rare.\r\nOur love is not here\r\nthough you smile,\r\nfull of sedulous grace.\r\nLost in darkness, I fear\r\nthe past is our resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Australian poet John Manifold reminds us never to marry werewolves! ...\r\n\r\nThe Griesly Wife\r\nby John Streeter Manifold\r\n\r\nLie still, my newly\r\nmarried wife,\r\nLie easy as you can.\r\nYou\'re young and ill\r\naccustomed yet\r\nTo sleeping with a\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow lay thick,\r\nthe moon was full\r\nAnd shone across the\r\nfloor.\r\nAnd the young wife\r\nwent with ne\'er a\r\nword\r\nBarefooted to the door.\r\n\r\nHe up and followed\r\nsure and fast,\r\nThe moon shone clear\r\nand white.\r\nBut before his coat\r\nwas on his back\r\nHis wife was out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nHe trod the trail\r\nwhere\'er it turned\r\nBy many a mound and\r\nscree,\r\nAnd still the barefoot\r\ntrack led on,\r\nAnd an angry man was\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nHe followed fast, he\r\nfollowed slow,\r\nAnd still he called\r\nher name,\r\nBut only the wild\r\ndogs out in the hills\r\nYowled back at him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHis hair stood up\r\nalong his neck,\r\nHis angry mind was\r\ngone,\r\nFor the track of the\r\ntwo bare feet gave out\r\nAnd a four-foot track\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nHer nightgown lay\r\nupon the snow\r\nAs it might upon the\r\nsheet,\r\nBut the track that\r\nled from where it lay\r\nWas ne\'er of human\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nHis heart turned over\r\nin his chest,\r\nHe looked from side\r\nto side,\r\nAnd he thought more\r\nof his blazing fire,\r\nThan he did of his\r\ngriesly bride.\r\n\r\nAnd first he started\r\nwalking back\r\nAnd then began to\r\nrun,\r\nAnd his quarry\r\nwheeled at the end of\r\nher track \r\nAnd hunted him in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nOh, long the fire may\r\nburn for him\r\nAnd open stand the\r\ndoor,\r\nAnd long may the bed\r\nwait empty:\r\nFor he\'ll never see it\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrson Welles reads The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer Kind\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\nI have gone out, a possessed witch,\r\nhaunting the black air, braver at night;\r\ndreaming evil, I have done my hitch\r\nover the plain houses, light by light:\r\nlonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.\r\nA woman like that is not a woman, quite.\r\nI have been her kind.\r\n\r\nI have found the warm caves in the woods,\r\nfilled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,\r\nclosets, silks, innumerable goods;\r\nfixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:\r\nwhining, rearranging the disaligned.\r\nA woman like that is misunderstood.\r\nI have been her kind.\r\n\r\nI have ridden in your cart, driver,\r\nwaved my nude arms at villages going by,\r\nlearning the last bright routes, survivor\r\nwhere your flames still bite my thigh\r\nand my ribs crack where your wheels wind.\r\nA woman like that is not ashamed to die.\r\nI have been her kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheme in Yellow\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\nI spot the hills\r\nWith yellow balls in autumn.\r\nI light the prairie cornfields\r\nOrange and tawny gold clusters\r\nAnd I am called pumpkins.\r\nOn the last of October\r\nWhen dusk is fallen\r\nChildren join hands\r\nAnd circle round me\r\nSinging ghost songs\r\nAnd love to the harvest moon;\r\nI am a jack-o\'-lantern\r\nWith terrible teeth\r\nAnd the children know\r\nI am fooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSea Fevers\r\nby Agnes Wathall\r\n\r\n\r\nNo ancient mariner I,\r\nHawker of public crosses,\r\nSnaring the passersby\r\nWith my necklace of albatrosses.\r\n\r\nI blink no glittering eye\r\nBetween tufts of gray sea mosses\r\nNor in the high road ply\r\nMy trade of guilts and glosses.\r\n\r\nBut a dark and inward sky\r\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\r\nNo more becalmed to lie,\r\nThe skeleton ship tosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter de la Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of the Witches\r\nfrom Macbeth, Act IV, Scene I\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThree witches, casting a spell ...\r\n\r\nRound about the cauldron go; \r\nIn the poisond entrails throw. \r\nToad, that under cold stone \r\nDays and nights hast thirty one \r\nSwelterd venom sleeping got, \r\nBoil thou first i the charmed pot. \r\n\r\nDouble, double toil and trouble; \r\nFire burn and cauldron bubble. \r\n\r\nFillet of a fenny snake, \r\nIn the cauldron boil and bake; \r\nEye of newt, and toe of frog, \r\nWool of bat, and tongue of dog, \r\nAdders fork, and blind-worms sting, \r\nLizards leg, and howlets wing, \r\nFor a charm of powerful trouble, \r\nLike a hell-broth boil and bubble. \r\n\r\nDouble, double toil and trouble; \r\nFire burn and cauldron bubble. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Fog\r\nby Giovanni Pascoli \r\ntranslated by Geoffrey Brock\r\n\r\nI stared into the valley: it was gone\r\nwholly submerged! A vast flat sea remained,\r\ngray, with no waves, no beaches; all was one.\r\n\r\nAnd here and there I noticed, when I strained,\r\nthe alien clamoring of small, wild voices:\r\nbirds that had lost their way in that vain land.\r\n\r\nAnd high above, the skeletons of beeches,\r\nas if suspended, and the reveries\r\nof ruins and of the hermits hidden reaches.\r\n\r\nAnd a dog yelped and yelped, as if in fear,\r\nI knew not where nor why. Perhaps he heard\r\nstrange footsteps, neither far away nor near\r\n\r\nechoing footsteps, neither slow nor quick,\r\nalternating, eternal. Down I stared,\r\nbut I saw nothing, no one, looking back.\r\n\r\nThe reveries of ruins asked: Will no\r\none come? The skeletons of trees inquired:\r\nAnd who are you, forever on the go?\r\n\r\nI may have seen a shadow then, an errant\r\nshadow, bearing a bundle on its head.\r\nI sawand no more saw, in the same instant.\r\n\r\nAll I could hear were the uneasy screeches\r\nof the lost birds, the yelping of the stray,\r\nand, on that sea that lacked both waves and beaches,\r\n\r\nthe footsteps, neither near nor far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalloween Snapshot\r\nby George Held\r\n\r\nThat devil in red satin suit\r\nWith tail and black mask,\r\nHolding a black plastic pitchfork,\r\nIs eight-year-old me,\r\nCostumed by my mom.\r\n\r\nLittle did she know then,\r\nWhen conjuring\r\nMy childish deviltry,\r\nI\'d grow up practicing\r\nThat black art poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Hallows Eve\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

His face burnt like a brand\r\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;\r\nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight,\r\n           (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)\r\nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nI\r\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;\r\nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon,\r\nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor,\r\nA red-coat troop came marching\r\n           Marchingmarching\r\nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nII\r\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,\r\nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;\r\nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!\r\nThere was death at every window;\r\n           And hell at one dark window;\r\nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.\r\n\r\nIII\r\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;\r\nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\r\n"Now, keep good watch!" and they kissed her.\r\n           She heard the dead man say\r\nLook for me by moonlight;\r\n           Watch for me by moonlight;\r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!\r\nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!\r\nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,\r\nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight,\r\n           Cold, on the stroke of midnight,\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!\r\n\r\nV\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\r\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,\r\nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;\r\nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight;\r\n           Blank and bare in the moonlight;\r\nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s refrain.\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;\r\nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?\r\nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,\r\nThe highwayman came riding,\r\n           Riding, riding!\r\nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!\r\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\r\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,\r\nThen her finger moved in the moonlight,\r\n           Her musket shattered the moonlight,\r\nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood\r\nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\r\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear\r\nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\n           The landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.\r\n\r\nIX\r\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,\r\nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\r\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,\r\nWhen they shot him down on the highway,\r\n           Down like a dog on the highway,\r\nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.\r\n\r\nX\r\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,\r\nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,\r\nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,\r\nA highwayman comes riding\r\n           Ridingriding\r\nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;\r\nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;\r\nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there\r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter,\r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter,\r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Angels, Winged\r\nby\r\nMichael R.

This night seems so long!\r\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\r\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Hunt\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOur Halloween is an inheritance from the ancient Celts. The Celts believed \r\nthat the otherworld can sometimes merge with the real world, so that elves, \r\nfairies, witches, warlocks and other fantastical entities are able to either \r\nhelp or harm human beings.\r\n\r\nNear Devon, the hunters appear in the sky\r\nwith Artur and Bedwyr sounding the call;\r\nand the others, laughing, go dashing by.\r\nThey only appear when the moon is full:\r\n\r\nValerin, the King of the Tangled Wood,\r\nand Valynt, the goodly King of Wales,\r\nGawain and Owain and the hearty men\r\nwho live on in many minstrels tales.\r\n\r\nThey seek the white stag on a moonlit moor,\r\nor Torc Triath, the fabled boar,\r\nor Ysgithyrwyn, or Twrch Trwyth,\r\nthe other mighty boars of myth.\r\n\r\nThey appear, sometimes, on Halloween\r\nto chase the moon across the green,\r\nthen fade into the shadowed hills\r\nwhere memory alone prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush\r\nby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\n"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"\r\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\nHer face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Mole\r\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\r\n\r\nAvoid the reeking herd,\r\nShun the polluted flock,\r\nLive like that stoic bird,\r\nThe eagle of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe huddled warmth of crowds\r\nBegets and fosters hate;\r\nHe keeps above the clouds\r\nHis cliff inviolate.\r\n\r\nWhen flocks are folded warm,\r\nAnd herds to shelter run,\r\nHe sails above the storm,\r\nHe stares into the sun.\r\n\r\nIf in the eagle\'s track\r\nYour sinews cannot leap,\r\nAvoid the lathered pack,\r\nTurn from the steaming sheep.\r\n\r\nIf you would keep your soul\r\nFrom spotted sight or sound,\r\nLive like the velvet mole:\r\nGo burrow underground.\r\n\r\nAnd there hold intercourse\r\nWith roots of trees and stones,\r\nWith rivers at their source,\r\nAnd disembodied bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6 from The Dark Side of the Deity: Interlude\r\nby\r\n\r\nJoe M. Ruggier\r\n\r\nWhen Satan hurled, before the Dawn,\r\ndefiance at the Lord of History;\r\nand Michael stood, and Glory shone,\r\nWhose hand controlled the timeless Mystery?\r\nWho but the Insult was the leveler;\r\nDeliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen Athens, sung in verse and prose,\r\ncaught all the World\'s imagination;\r\nwhen Ilion fell, and Rome arose,\r\nand Time went on like pagination:\r\n Who but the Insult was the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen books, in numberless infinities,\r\ncross-fertilize the teeming brain,\r\nand warring, vex the Soul with Vanities,\r\n and Insults hurtle, Insults rain:\r\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nAnd when we too shall cease to be,\r\n like all the Kingdoms of the Past,\r\nand groaning, gasping, wrenching free,\r\n we bite, at last, alone, the dust:\r\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\r\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\r\n\r\nWhen churchbells fill the wandering fields\r\n  with Love and Fear,\r\nthe Flesh and Blood of Jesus yields\r\n  deliverance dear,\r\nto them who believe in the Compliment Sinsear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct\r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n"The brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long duration" Horace\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\nLove and desire and hate:\r\nI think they have no portion in us after\r\nWe pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\nOut of a misty dream\r\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\r\nWithin a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII from Sunday Morning\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\n\r\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\r\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\r\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\r\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\r\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\r\nOr old despondency of day and night,\r\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\r\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\r\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\r\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\r\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\r\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\r\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\r\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\r\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster Hymn\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bustle In A House\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThe bustle in a house\r\nThe morning after death\r\nIs solemnest of industries\r\nEnacted upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping up the heart\r\nAnd putting love away\r\nWe shall not want to use again\r\nUntil eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Broken Tower\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\r\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\r\nOf a spent dayto wander the cathedral lawn\r\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\r\n\r\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\r\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\r\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\r\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\r\n\r\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\r\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas, campaniles with reveilles out leaping \r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hopecleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)but slip\r\nOf pebbles,visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides ... High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResume\r\nby Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nRazors pain you;\r\nRivers are damp;\r\nAcids stain you;\r\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\r\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\r\nNooses give;\r\nGas smells awful;\r\nYou might as well live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiem\r\nby Robert L. Stevenson\r\n\r\nUnder the wide and starry sky\r\nDig the grave and let me lie.\r\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\r\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\r\n\r\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\r\n"Here he lies where he longed to be,\r\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\r\nAnd the hunter home from the hill."\r\n\r\n\r\nHaunted Houses\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nAll houses wherein men have lived and died\r\nAre haunted houses. Through the open doors\r\nThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,\r\nWith feet that make no sound upon the floors.\r\n\r\nWe meet them at the door-way, on the stair,\r\nAlong the passages they come and go,\r\nImpalpable impressions on the air,\r\nA sense of something moving to and fro.\r\n\r\nThere are more guests at table than the hosts\r\nInvited; the illuminated hall\r\nIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\r\nAs silent as the pictures on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe stranger at my fireside cannot see\r\nThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;\r\nHe but perceives what is; while unto me\r\nAll that has been is visible and clear.\r\n\r\nWe have no title-deeds to house or lands;\r\nOwners and occupants of earlier dates\r\nFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,\r\nAnd hold in mortmain still their old estates.\r\n\r\nThe spirit-world around this world of sense\r\nFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhere\r\nWafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense\r\nA vital breath of more ethereal air.\r\n\r\nOur little lives are kept in equipoise\r\nBy opposite attractions and desires;\r\nThe struggle of the instinct that enjoys,\r\nAnd the more noble instinct that aspires.\r\n\r\nThese perturbations, this perpetual jar\r\nOf earthly wants and aspirations high,\r\nCome from the influence of an unseen star\r\nAn undiscovered planet in our sky.\r\n\r\nAnd as the moon from some dark gate of cloud\r\nThrows o\'er the sea a floating bridge of light,\r\nAcross whose trembling planks our fancies crowd\r\nInto the realm of mystery and night,\r\n\r\nSo from the world of spirits there descends\r\nA bridge of light, connecting it with this,\r\nO\'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,\r\nWander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore great ghost stories and other eerie, haunting Halloween poems of note:\r\n\r\nLa Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats\r\nLamia by John Keats\r\nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\r\nby Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\nMariana  by Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\nThe\r\nHaunted Chamber  by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\nThe Rainy Day by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\nThe Apparition by John Donne\r\nLady Lazarus by Sylvia Plath\r\nDaddy by Sylvia Plath\r\nGoblin Market by Christina Rossetti \r\nThe Blessed Damozel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nSudden Light by Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nAllayne by Kevin N.
