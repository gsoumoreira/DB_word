Many of these poems are subtly or tantalizingly \r\nsexualnaughty or risqu\xe9rather than graphic. Erotic poems come in all shapes, sizes and forms: \r\nhaiku, tanka, epigrams, sonnets, free verse, etc. The best erotic poets include \r\nthe Archpoet, Basho, William Blake, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her husband \r\nRobert Browning, Lord Byron, Catullus, Lucille Clifton, Colette, Hart Crane, H. D., John Donne, \r\nErnest Dowson, William Dunbar, T. S. Eliot, Allen Ginsberg, \r\nHafiz, Robert Herrick, Horace, D. H. Lawrence, \r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay, Pablo Neruda, Ana\xefs Nin, Ovid, Dorothy Parker, Sylvia Plath, Adrienne Rich, \r\nRumi, George Sand, Sappho, Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Walt Whitman, Thomas Wyatt and William Butler Yeats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nThe most famous come on or carpe diem poems in the English language include Robert Herricks \r\nTo the Virgins, to Make Much of Time, Andrew Marvell\'s To His Coy Mistress and Christopher Marlowe\'s The Passionate Shepherd to His Love. But the greatest love poem of allby a landslide in my opinionis Hart Crane\'s fabulous Voyages. \r\n(All the poems mentioned here appear on this page.)\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R.

Robert Herrick was also an ordained minister, and the vicar of Dean Prior in Devonshire. Sappho may have been a \r\npriestess of the love goddess Aphrodite. And while we may never know the real identity of the writer of the Song of Solomon, that sizzling bit of erotica did end up \r\nin the Bible! Thus there seems to be a very close and intimate connection between sexuality and spirituality ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with this erotic little number many years ago, and ended up \r\ntranslating it myself. Here, Sappho of Lesbos conveys the elemental nature of \r\nEros, the Greek god of sexual love and lust. Our term erotic derives from the name \r\nEros, just as our terms sapphic and lesbian derive from Sappho\'s name and \r\nthe name of her island home. Interestingly, Eros was the son of \r\nAphrodite (the goddess of love) and Ares (the god of war)! And in this poem love \r\ndoes sound like a battlefield, to borrow a phrase from Pat Benatar. I believe Sappho is telling us that she can\'t always control the way she \r\nfeels, or what happens when she falls in love. Oscar Wilde once said that he \r\ncould resist everything but temptation. William Blake opined that only people \r\nwith weak passions \r\ncan control them. Robert Herrick said that he was bewitched by a \r\nglimpse of his lover\'s underwear. Thus, some of the \r\ngreatest love poets seem to agree that lust is a force beyond our ability to \r\nresist! \r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 155\r\nloose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nMy lover nude and knowing my heart\'s whims\r\nWore nothing more than a few bright-flashing gems;\r\nHer art was saving men despite their sins\r\nShe ruled like harem girls crowned with diadems! \r\n\r\nShe danced for me with a gay but mocking air,\r\nMy world of stone and metal sparking bright;\r\nI discovered in her the rapture of everything fair\r\nNay, an excess of joy where the spirit and flesh unite! \r\n\r\nNaked she lay and offered herself to me,\r\nParting her legs and smiling receptively,\r\nAs gentle and yet profound as the rising sea\r\nTill her surging tide encountered my cliff, abruptly. \r\n\r\nA tigress tamed, her eyes met mine, intent ...\r\nIntent on lust, content to purr and please!\r\nHer breath, both languid and lascivious, lent \r\nAn odd charm to her metamorphoses. \r\n\r\nHer limbs, her loins, her abdomen, her thighs,\r\nOiled alabaster, sinuous as a swan,\r\nWrithed pale before my calm clairvoyant eyes;\r\nLike clustered grapes her breasts and belly shone. \r\n\r\nSkilled in more spells than evil imps can muster,\r\nTo break the peace which had possessed my heart,\r\nShe flashed her crystal rocks hypnotic luster\r\nTill my quietude was shattered, blown apart. \r\n\r\nHer waist awrithe, her breasts enormously \r\nOut-thrust, and yet ... and yet, somehow, still coy ...\r\nAs if stout haunches of Antiope \r\nHad been grafted to a boy ... \r\n\r\nThe room grew dark, the lamp had flickered out.\r\nMute firelight, alone, lit each glowing stud;\r\nEach time the fire sighed, as if in doubt,\r\nIt steeped her pale, rouged flesh in pools of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Do Women Want?\r\nby Kim Addonizio\r\n\r\nI want a red dress.\r\nI want it flimsy and cheap,\r\nI want it too tight, I want to wear it\r\nuntil someone tears it off me.\r\nI want it sleeveless and backless,\r\nthis dress, so no one has to guess\r\nwhat\'s underneath. I want to walk down\r\nthe street past Thrifty\'s and the hardware store\r\nwith all those keys glittering in the window,\r\npast Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old\r\ndonuts in their caf\xe9, past the Guerra brothers\r\nslinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly,\r\nhoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders.\r\nI want to walk like I\'m the only\r\nwoman on earth and I can have my pick.\r\nI want that red dress bad.\r\nI want it to confirm\r\nyour worst fears about me,\r\nto show you how little I care about you\r\nor anything except what\r\nI want. When I find it, I\'ll pull that garment\r\nfrom its hanger like I\'m choosing a body\r\nto carry me into this world, through\r\nthe birth-cries and the love-cries too,\r\nand I\'ll wear it like bones, like skin,\r\nit\'ll be the goddamned\r\ndress they bury me in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Receiving of the Flower\r\nexcerpt from a Mayan love poem\r\ntranslated by Michael R.

But not\r\nyour wish or mine can quite yet make that so:\r\nWhen will your soul-husk lust enough to know\r\nto crack and writhe true flesh free from my thought?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove and Sleep\r\nby Algernon Charles Swinburne\r\n\r\nLying asleep between the strokes of night\r\nI saw my love lean over my sad bed,\r\nPale as the duskiest lily\'s leaf or head,\r\nSmooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite,\r\nToo wan for blushing and too warm for white,\r\nBut perfect-coloured without white or red.\r\nAnd her lips opened amorously, and said\r\nI wist not what, saving one wordDelight.\r\nAnd all her face was honey to my mouth,\r\nAnd all her body pasture to mine eyes;\r\nThe long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire,\r\nThe quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,\r\nThe bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs\r\nAnd glittering eyelids of my soul\'s desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Touch of You\r\nby Witter Bynner\r\n\r\nAt the touch of you,\r\nAs if you were an archer with your swift hand at the bow,\r\nThe arrows of delight shot through my body.\r\n\r\nYou were spring,\r\nAnd I the edge of a cliff,\r\nAnd a shining waterfall rushed over me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGloire de Dijon\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\nWhen she rises in the morning\r\nI linger to watch her;\r\nShe spreads the bath cloth underneath the window\r\nAnd the sunbeams catch her\r\nGlistening white on the shoulders,\r\nWhile down her sides the mellow\r\nGolden shadow glows as\r\nShe stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts\r\nSway like full blown yellow Gloire de Dijon roses.\r\nShe drips herself with water, and her shoulders\r\nGlisten as silver, they crumple up\r\nLike wet and falling roses, and I listen\r\nFor the sluicing of their rain dishevelled petals.\r\nIn the window full of sunlight\r\nConcentrates her golden shadow\r\nFold on fold, until it glows as\r\nMellow as the glory roses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ancient Egyptian Love Lyric (circa 1085-570 BC)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\nIs there anything sweeter than these hours of love,\r\nwhen were together, and my heart races?\r\nFor what is better than embracing and fondling\r\nwhen you visit me and we surrender to delights?\r\nIf you reach to caress my thigh,\r\nI will offer you my breast also \r\nits soft; it won\'t jab you or thrust you away!\r\nWill you leave me because youre hungry?\r\nAre you ruled by your belly?\r\nWill you leave me because you need something to wear?\r\nI have chests full of fine linen!\r\nWill you leave me because youre thirsty?\r\nHere, suck my breasts! Theyre full to overflowing, and all for you!\r\nI glory in the hours of our embracings;\r\nmy joy is incalculable!\r\nThe thrill of your love spreads through my body\r\nlike honey in water,\r\nlike a drug mixed with spices,\r\nlike wine mingled with water.\r\nOh, that you would speed to see your sister\r\nlike a stallion in heat, like a bull to his heifer!\r\nFor the heavens have granted us love like flames igniting straw,\r\ndesire like the falcons free-falling frenzy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Courtesan\'s Love Lyric\r\nby Veronica Franco\r\nloose translation by Michael R.

Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda and the Swan\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\r\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\r\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\r\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\r\n\r\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\r\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\r\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\r\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\r\n\r\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\r\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\r\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\r\nBeing so caught up,\r\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\r\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\r\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, to Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\n    I sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\n    Not so much honouring thee,\r\n    As giving it a hope, that there\r\n    It could not withered be.\r\n    But thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\n    And sent\'st back to me:\r\n    Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\n    Not of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Turtle  by Ogden Nash\r\n\r\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks\r\nWhich practically conceal its sex.\r\nI think it clever of the turtle\r\nIn such a fix to be so fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo His Mistress Going to Bed\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nCome, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,\r\nUntil I labour, I in labour lie.\r\nThe foe oft-times having the foe in sight,\r\nIs tird with standing though he never fight.\r\nOff with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,\r\nBut a far fairer world encompassing.\r\nUnpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,\r\nThat theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.\r\nUnlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,\r\nTells me from you, that now it is bed time.\r\nOff with that happy busk, which I envy,\r\nThat still can be, and still can stand so nigh.\r\nYour gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,\r\nAs when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.\r\nOff with that wiry Coronet \r\nand shew\r\nThe hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:\r\nNow off with \r\nthose shoes, and then safely tread\r\nIn this loves hallowd temple, this soft \r\nbed.\r\nIn such white robes, heavens Angels used to be\r\nReceived by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee\r\nA heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though\r\nIll spirits walk \r\nin white, we easily know,\r\nBy this these Angels from an evil sprite,\r\nThose set \r\nour hairs, but these our flesh upright.\r\nLicence my \r\nroving hands, and let them go,\r\nBefore, behind, between, above, \r\nbelow.\r\nO my America! my new-found-land,\r\nMy kingdom, safeliest when with one man \r\nmannd,\r\nMy Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,\r\nHow blest am I in this \r\ndiscovering thee!\r\nTo enter in these bonds, is to be free;\r\nThen where my hand is \r\nset, my seal shall be.\r\nFull nakedness! All joys are due \r\nto thee,\r\nAs souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,\r\nTo taste whole joys. Gems \r\nwhich you women use\r\nAre like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,\r\nThat when a \r\nfools eye lighteth on a Gem,\r\nHis earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.\r\nLike \r\npictures, or like books gay coverings made\r\nFor lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;\r\nThemselves are mystic books, which only we\r\n(Whom \r\ntheir imputed grace will dignify)\r\nMust see reveald. Then since that I may know; \r\n\r\nAs liberally, as to a Midwife, shew\r\nThy self: cast all, yea, this white linen \r\nhence,\r\nThere is no penance due to innocence.\r\nTo teach \r\nthee, I am naked first; why then\r\nWhat needst thou have more covering than a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maidens Song\r\nMedieval Lyric, Poet Unknown\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maidens came when I was in my mothers bower.\r\nI had all that I would.\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n   The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nThe silver is white, red is the gold;\r\nThe robes they lay in fold.\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n  The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nAnd through the glass window shines the sun.\r\nHow should I love, and I so young?\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n  The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Love\r\nby Robert Penn Warren\r\nIn silence the heart raves. It utters words\r\nMeaningless, that never had\r\nA meaning. I was ten, skinny, red-headed,\r\nFreckled. In a big black Buick,\r\nDriven by a big grown boy, with a necktie, she sat\r\nIn front of the drugstore, sipping something\r\nThrough a straw. There is nothing like\r\nBeauty. It stops your heart. It\r\nThickens your blood. It stops your breath. It\r\nMakes you feel dirty. You need a hot bath.\r\nI leaned against a telephone pole, and watched.\r\nI thought I would die if she saw me.\r\nHow could I exist in the same world with that brightness?\r\nTwo years later she smiled at me. She\r\nNamed my name. I thought I would wake up dead.\r\nHer grown brothers walked with the bent-knee\r\nSwagger of horsemen. They were slick-faced.\r\nTold jokes in the barbershop. Did no work.\r\nTheir father was what is called a drunkard.\r\nWhatever he was he stayed on the third floor\r\nOf the big white farmhouse under the maples for twenty-five years.\r\nHe never came down. They brought everything up to him.\r\nI did not know what a mortgage was.\r\nHis wife was a good, Christian woman, and prayed.\r\nWhen the daughter got married, the old man came down wearing\r\nAn old tail coat, the pleated shirt yellowing.\r\nThe sons propped him. I saw the wedding. There were\r\nEngraved invitations, it was so fashionable. I thought\r\nI would cry. I lay in bed that night\r\nAnd wondered if she would cry when something was done to her.\r\nThe mortgage was foreclosed. That last word was whispered.\r\nShe never came back. The family\r\nSort of drifted off. Nobody wears shiny boots like that now.\r\nBut I know she is beautiful forever, and lives\r\nIn a beautiful house, far away.\r\nShe called my name once. I didn\'t even know she knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\r\nBut as for me, alas!, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame.\r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. In May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly \r\ncommitting adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released from the Tower later that \r\nyear, thanks to his friendship and his father\'s friendship with Thomas Cromwell. But during his stay in the Tower, \r\nWyatt may have \r\nwitnessed the execution of Anne Boleyn from his cell window, and the  \r\nexecutions of the five other men with whom she was accused of committing \r\nadultery. A common interpretation of this poem is that the deer (dear) is Anne \r\nBoleyn, and that Caesar is King Henry VIII, who had her and her lovers beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n     \r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n     \r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n     \r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\nI have been here before,\r\n\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\n\r\nThe sweet keen smell,\r\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore.\r\nYou have been mine before,\r\n\r\nHow long ago I may not know:\r\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\r\n\r\nYour neck turned so,\r\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore.\r\nHas this been thus before?\r\n\r\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\r\nStill with our lives our love restore\r\n\r\nIn death\'s despite,\r\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Am Vertical\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nBut I would rather be horizontal.\r\nI am not a tree with my root in the soil\r\nSucking up minerals and motherly love\r\nSo that each March I may gleam into leaf,\r\nNor am I the beauty of a garden bed\r\nAttracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted,\r\nUnknowing I must soon unpetal.\r\nCompared with me, a tree is immortal\r\nAnd a flower-head not tall, but more startling,\r\nAnd I want the one\'s longevity and the other\'s daring.\r\n\r\nTonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,\r\nThe trees and the flowers have been strewing their cool odors.\r\nI walk among them, but none of them are noticing.\r\nSometimes I think that when I am sleeping\r\nI must most perfectly resemble them \r\nThoughts gone dim.\r\nIt is more natural to me, lying down.\r\nThen the sky and I are in open conversation,\r\nAnd I shall be useful when I lie down finally:\r\nThen the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Living Hand\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\r\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\r\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\r\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\r\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\r\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\r\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\r\nI hold it towards you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Nights\r\nby Thomas Campion\r\nNow winter nights enlarge\r\nThe number of their hours,\r\nAnd clouds their storms discharge\r\nUpon the airy towers.\r\nLet now the chimneys blaze\r\nAnd cups o\'erflow with wine;\r\nLet well-tuned words amaze\r\nWith harmony divine.\r\nNow yellow waxen lights\r\nShall wait on honey love,\r\nWhile youthful revels, masques, and courtly sights\r\nSleep\'s leaden spells remove.\r\nThis time doth well dispense\r\nWith lovers\' long discourse;\r\nMuch speed hath some defence,\r\nThough beauty no remorse.\r\nAll do not all things well;\r\nSome measures comely tread,\r\nSome knotted riddles tell,\r\nSome poems smoothly read.\r\nThe summer hath his joys,\r\nAnd winter his delights;\r\nThough love and all his pleasures are but toys,\r\nThey shorten tedious nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnthralled\r\nby Alfred Bryan\r\nTeach me to sin\r\nIn love\'s forbidden ways,\r\nFor you can make all passion pure;\r\nThe magic lure of your sweet eyes\r\nEach shape of sin makes virtue praise.\r\nTeach me to sin\r\nEnslave me to your wanton charms,\r\nCrush me in your velvet arms\r\nAnd make me, make me love you.\r\nMake me fire your blood with new desire,\r\nAnd make me kiss youlip and limb,\r\nTill sense reel and pulses swim.\r\nAye! even if you hate me,\r\nTeach me to sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho to Phil\xe6nis\r\nby John Donne\r\nWhere is that holy fire, which verse is said\r\nTo have? Is that enchanting force decayd?\r\nVerse that draws natures works from natures law,\r\nThee, her best work, to her work cannot draw.\r\nHave my tears quenchd my old poetic fire?\r\nWhy quenchd they not as well that of desire?\r\nThoughts, my minds creatures, often are with thee,\r\nBut I, their maker, want their liberty.\r\nOnly thine image in my heart doth sit,\r\nBut that is wax, and fires environ it.\r\nMy fires have driven, thine have drawn it hence;\r\nAnd I am robbd of picture, heart, and sense.\r\nDwells with me still mine irksome memory,\r\nWhich, both to keep and lose, grieves equally.\r\nThat tells me how fair thou art; thou art so fair\r\nAs gods, when gods to thee I do compare,\r\nAre graced thereby; and to make blind men see,\r\nWhat things gods are, I say theyre like to thee.\r\nFor if we justly call each silly man\r\nA little world, what shall we call thee then?\r\nThou art not soft, and clear, and straight, and fair,\r\nAs down, as stars, cedars, and lilies are;\r\nBut thy right hand, and cheek, and eye, only\r\nAre like thy other hand, and cheek, and eye.\r\nSuch was my Phao awhile, but shall be never,\r\nAs thou wast, art, and O, mayst thou be ever.\r\nHere lovers swear in their idolatry,\r\nThat I am such; but grief discolours me.\r\nAnd yet I grieve the less, lest grief remove\r\nMy beauty, and make me unworthy of thy love.\r\nPlays some soft boy with thee, O, there wants yet\r\nA mutual feeling which should sweeten it.\r\nHis chin, a thorny, hairy unevenness\r\nDoth threaten, and some daily change possess.\r\nThy body is a natural paradise,\r\nIn whose self, unmanured, all pleasure lies,\r\nNor needs perfection; why shouldst thou then\r\nAdmit the tillage of a harsh rough man?\r\nMen leave behind them that which their sin shows,\r\nAnd are as thieves traced, which rob when it snows.\r\nBut of our dalliance no more signs there are,\r\nThan fishes leave in streams, or birds in air;\r\nAnd between us all sweetness may be had,\r\nAll, all that nature yields, or art can add.\r\nMy two lips, eyes, thighs, differ from thy two\r\nBut so, as thine from one another do,\r\nAnd, O, no more; the likeness being such,\r\nWhy should they not alike in all parts touch?\r\nHand to strange hand, lip to lip none denies;\r\nWhy should they breast to breast, or thighs to thighs?\r\nLikeness begets such strange self-flattery,\r\nThat touching myself all seems done to thee.\r\nMyself I embrace, and mine own hands I kiss,\r\nAnd amorously thank myself for this.\r\nMe, in my glass, I call thee; but alas,\r\nWhen I would kiss, tears dim mine eyes and glass.\r\nO cure this loving madness, and restore\r\nMe to thee, thee my half, my all, my more.\r\nSo may thy cheeks red outwear scarlet dye,\r\nAnd their white, whiteness of the Galaxy;\r\nSo may thy mighty, amazing beauty move\r\nEnvy in all women, and in all men love;\r\nAnd so be change and sickness far from thee,\r\nAs thou by coming near keepst them from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vine\r\nby Ovid\r\ntranslated by Christopher Marlowe\r\nI dreamed this mortal part of mine\r\nWas metamorphosed to a vine,\r\nWhich crawling one and every way\r\nEnthralled my dainty Lucia.\r\nMethought her long small legs and thighs\r\nI with my tendrils did surprise;\r\nHer belly, buttocks, and her waist\r\nBy my soft nervelets were embraced.\r\nAbout her head I writhing hung,\r\nAnd with rich clusters (hid among\r\nThe leaves) her temples I behung,\r\nSo that my Lucia seemed to me\r\nYoung Bacchus ravished by his tree.\r\nMy curls about her neck did crawl,\r\nAnd arms and hands they did enthrall,\r\nSo that she could not freely stir\r\n(All parts there made one prisoner).\r\nBut when I crept with leaves to hide\r\nThose parts which maids keep unespied,\r\nSuch fleeting pleasures there I took\r\nThat with the fancy I awoke;\r\nAnd found (ah me!) this flesh of mine\r\nMore like a stock than like a vine.\r\nUpon the Nipples of Julia\'s Breast\r\nHave you beheld (with much delight)\r\nA red rose peeping through a white?\r\nOr else a cherry (double graced)\r\nWithin a lily? Centre placed?\r\nOr ever marked the pretty beam,\r\nA strawberry shows, half drowned in cream?\r\nOr seen rich rubies blushing through\r\nA pure smooth pearl, and orient too?\r\nSo like to this, nay all the rest,\r\nIs each neat niplet of her breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a lady sweet and kind\r\nby Thomas Ford\r\nThere is a lady sweet and kind,\r\nWas never face so pleas\'d my mind;\r\nI did but see her passing by,\r\nAnd yet I love her till I die.\r\nHer gesture, motion, and her smiles,\r\nHer wit, her voice, my heart beguiles,\r\nBeguiles my heart, I know not why,\r\nAnd yet I love her till I die.\r\nHer free behaviour, winning looks,\r\nWill make a lawyer burn his books;\r\nI touch\'d her not, alas! not I,\r\nAnd yet I love her till I die.\r\nHad I her fast betwixt mine arms,\r\nJudge you that think such sports were harms,\r\nWere\'t any harm? no, no, fie, fie,\r\nFor I will love her till I die.\r\nShould I remain confined there\r\nSo long as Phbus in his sphere,\r\nI to request, she to deny,\r\nYet would I love her till I die.\r\nCupid is winged and doth range,\r\nHer country so my love doth change:\r\nBut change she earth, or change she sky,\r\nYet will I love her till I die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nBecause I liked you better\r\n  Than suits a man to say,\r\nIt irked you, and I promised\r\n  To throw the thought away.\r\n\r\nTo put the world between us\r\n  We parted, stiff and dry;\r\n\'Good-bye,\' said you, \'forget me.\'\r\n  \'I will, no fear\', said I.\r\n\r\nIf here, where clover whitens\r\n  The dead man\'s knoll, you pass,\r\nAnd no tall flower to meet you\r\n  Starts in the trefoiled grass,\r\n\r\nHalt by the headstone naming\r\n  The heart no longer stirred,\r\nAnd say the lad that loved you\r\n  Was one that kept his word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaming of Parts\r\nby Henry Reed\r\n\r\nVixi duellis nuper idoneus\r\nEt militavi non sine glori\r\n\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling \r\nswivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let \r\nme\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring.

you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April\r\nShakes out her rain-drenched hair,\r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted,\r\nI shall not care.\r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful\r\nWhen rain bends down the bough;\r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted\r\nThan you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nThe Dark-Eyed Gentlemanby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nI pitched my day\'s leazings in Crimmercrock Lane,\r\nTo tie up my garter and jog on again,\r\nWhen a dear dark-eyed gentleman passed there and said,\r\nin a way that made all o\' me colour rose red,\r\n\'What do I see\r\nO pretty knee!\'\r\nAnd he came and he tied up my garter for me.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\'Twixt sunset and moonrise it was, I can mind:\r\nAh, \'tis easy to lose what we nevermore find!\r\nof the dear stranger\'s home, of his name, I knew nought,\r\nBut I soon knew his nature and all that it brought.\r\nThen bitterly\r\nSobbed I that he\r\nShould ever have tied up my garter for me!\r\n\r\nIII\r\nYet now I\'ve beside me a fine lissom lad,\r\nAnd my slip\'s nigh forgot, and my days are not sad;\r\nMy own dearest joy is he, comrade, and friend,\r\nhe it is who safe-guards me, on him I depend;\r\nNo sorrow brings he,\r\nAnd thankful I be\r\nThat his daddy once tied up my garter for me!\r\n\r\nNote: Leazings means a bundle of gleaned corn.

So perhaps they learned to tolerate their partners\r\nflaws, trusting that theirs would be forgiven in turn.\r\n\r\nNow every genetic error meets with such\r\ndisgust that crowds might spit on them and stone them.\r\n\r\nAs happened in the city of K., where the town council\r\nvoted to exile a girl\r\n\r\nSo thickset and squat\r\nthat no stylish dress could ever suit her,\r\n\r\nBut lets not yearn for the days of prenormalization.\r\nJust think of the torments, the anxieties, the sweat,\r\nthe wiles needed to entice, in spite of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFires\r\nby Joseph Campbell\r\n\r\nThe little fires that Nature lights \r\nThe scilla\'s lamp, the daffodil \r\nShe quenches, when of stormy nights\r\nHer anger whips the hill.\r\n\r\nThe fires she lifts against the cloud \r\nThe irised bow, the burning tree \r\nShe batters down with curses loud,\r\nNor cares that death should be.\r\n\r\nThe fire she kindles in the soul \r\nThe poet\'s mood, the rebel\'s thought \r\nShe cannot master, for their coal\r\nIn other mines is wrought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarter \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nAll beautiful and splendid things,\r\nBlue waves whitened on a cliff,\r\nSoaring fire that sways and sings,\r\nAnd children\'s faces looking up\r\nHolding wonder in a cup.\r\n\r\nLife has loveliness to sell,\r\nMusic like a curve of gold,\r\nScent of pine trees in the rain,\r\nEyes that love you, arms that hold,\r\nAnd for your spirit\'s still delight,\r\nHoly thoughts that star the night.\r\n\r\nSpend all you have for loveliness,\r\nBuy it and never count the cost;\r\nFor one white singing hour of peace\r\nCount many a year of strife well lost,\r\nAnd for a breath of ecstasy\r\nGive all you have been, or could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeaceby Sara Teasdale\r\nPeace flows into me\r\nAs the tide to the pool by the shore;\r\nIt is mine forevermore,\r\nIt ebbs not back like the sea.\r\n\r\nI am the pool of blue\r\nThat worships the vivid sky;\r\nMy hopes were heaven-high,\r\nThey are all fulfilled in you.\r\n\r\nI am the pool of gold\r\nWhen sunset burns and dies,\r\nYou are my deepening skies,\r\nGive me your stars to hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs My Team Plowing\r\nby A.

I do not think I would.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\r\nI only know that summer sang in me\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\n\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\nOr rich with red corundum or with blue,\r\nLocked, and the key withheld, as other girls\r\nHave given their loves, I give my love to you;\r\nNot in a lovers\'-knot, not in a ring\r\nWorked in such fashion, and the legend plain\r\nSemper fidelis, where a secret spring\r\nKennels a drop of mischief for the brain:\r\nLove in the open hand, no thing but that,\r\nUngemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,\r\nAs one should bring you cowslips in a hat\r\nSwung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,\r\nI bring you, calling out as children do:\r\nLook what I have!And these are all for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBagpipe Music\r\nby Louis MacNeice\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\r\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the \r\npeepshow.\r\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes \r\nare made of python,\r\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls \r\nwith head of bison.\r\n\r\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\r\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\r\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\r\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\r\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a \r\ntaxi.\r\n\r\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the \r\nheather,\r\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\r\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\r\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the \r\npuncture.\r\n\r\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was \r\nsober,\r\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one \r\nfoot over.\r\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with \r\nrepulsion,\r\nSaid to the midwife Take it away; I\'m through with \r\noverproduction.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the gossip column, it\'s no go the Ceilidh,\r\nAll we want is a mother\'s help and a sugar-stick for the \r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nWillie Murray cut his thumb, couldn\'t count the damage,\r\nTook the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a \r\nbandage.\r\nHis brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,\r\nThrew the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the \r\nparish.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Herring Board, it\'s no go the Bible,\r\nAll we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the picture palace, it\'s no go the stadium,\r\nIt\'s no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,\r\nIt\'s no go the Government grants, it\'s no go the \r\nelections,\r\nSit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a \r\npension.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go my honey love, it\'s no go my poppet;\r\nWork your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the \r\nprofit.\r\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall \r\nforever,\r\nBut if you break the bloody glass you won\'t hold up the \r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Penitent\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nI had a little Sorrow,\r\n Born of a little Sin,\r\n I found a room all damp with gloom\r\nAnd shut us all within;\r\n And, Little Sorrow, weep, said I,\r\n And, Little Sin, pray God to die,\r\nAnd I upon the floor will lie\r\nAnd think how bad I\'ve been!\r\n\r\nAlas for pious planning \r\nIt mattered not a whit!\r\n As far as gloom went in that room,\r\nThe lamp might have been lit!\r\n My little Sorrow would not weep,\r\n My little Sin would go to sleep \r\n To save my soul I could not keep\r\nMy graceless mind on it!\r\n\r\nSo I got up in anger,\r\nAnd took a book I had,\r\nAnd put a ribbon on my  hair\r\nTo please a passing lad,\r\nAnd, One thing there\'s no getting by \r\nI\'ve been a wicked girl, said I:\r\nBut if I can\'t be sorry, why,\r\nI might as well be glad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Supermarket in California\r\nby Allen Ginsberg\r\n\r\nWhat thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, \r\nfor I walked down the\r\nstreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious \r\nlooking at the full moon.\r\nIn my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I \r\nwent into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!\r\nWhat peaches and what penumbras! Whole families \r\nshopping at night! Aisles\r\nfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the \r\ntomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the \r\nwatermelons?\r\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old \r\ngrubber, poking among the\r\nmeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the \r\npork chops? What price\r\nbananas? Are you my Angel?\r\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of \r\ncans following you, and\r\nfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our \r\nsolitary fancy tasting\r\nartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never \r\npassing the cashier.\r\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in \r\nan hour. Which way does\r\nyour beard point tonight?\r\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the \r\nsupermarket and feel\r\nabsurd.)\r\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The \r\ntrees add shade to\r\nshade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love \r\npast blue automobiles in\r\ndriveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old \r\ncourage-teacher, what America did you\r\nhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out \r\non a smoking bank and\r\nstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of \r\nLethe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Helen \r\nby Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\nHelen, thy beauty is to me\r\n   Like those Nicean barks of yore,\r\nThat gently, o\'er a perfumed sea,\r\n   The weary, wayworn wanderer bore\r\n   To his own native shore.\r\n\r\nOn desperate seas long wont to roam,\r\n   Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,\r\nThy Naiad airs have brought me home\r\n   To the glory that was Greece\r\n   And the grandeur that was Rome.\r\n\r\nLo! in yon brilliant window-niche\r\n   How statue-like I see thee stand,\r\nThe agate lamp within thy hand!\r\n   Ah, Psyche, from the regions which\r\n   Are Holy Land!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit may not always be so; and i say\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nit may not always be so;and i say\r\nthat if your lips,which i have loved,should touch\r\nanother\'s,and your dear strong fingers clutch\r\nhis heart,as mine in time not far away;\r\nif on another\'s face your sweet hair lay\r\nin such a silence as i know,or such\r\ngreat writhing words as,uttering overmuch,\r\nstand helplessly before the spirit at bay;\r\n\r\nif this should be,i say if this should be\r\nyou of my heart,send me a little word;\r\nthat i may go unto him,and take his hands,\r\nsaying,Accept all happiness from me.\r\nThen shall i turn my face,and hear one bird\r\nsing terribly afar in the lost lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe Walks In Beauty\r\nby Lord Bryon\r\n\r\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\r\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\r\nAnd all that\'s best of dark and bright\r\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes:\r\nThus mellow\'d to that tender light\r\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\r\n\r\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\r\nHad half impair\'d the nameless grace\r\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\r\nOr softly lightens o\'er her face;\r\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express\r\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nAnd on that cheek, and o\'er that brow,\r\nSo soft, so calm, yet eloquent,\r\nThe smiles that win, the tints that glow,\r\nBut tell of days in goodness spent,\r\nA mind at peace with all below,\r\nA heart whose love is innocent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting at Night\r\nby Robert Browning\r\n\r\nThe grey sea and the long black land;\r\nAnd the yellow half-moon large and low;\r\nAnd the startled little waves that leap\r\nIn fiery ringlets from their sleep,\r\nAs I gain the cove with pushing prow,\r\nAnd quench its speed i\' the slushy sand.\r\n\r\nThen a mile of warm sea-scented beach;\r\nThree fields to cross till a farm appears;\r\nA tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch\r\nAnd blue spurt of a lighted match,\r\nAnd a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,\r\nThan the two hearts beating each to each!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silken Tent\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nShe is as in a field a silken tent\r\nAt midday when the sunny summer breeze\r\nHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,\r\nSo that in guys it gently sways at ease,\r\nAnd its supporting central cedar pole,\r\nThat is its pinnacle to heavenward\r\nAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,\r\nSeems to owe naught to any single cord,\r\nBut strictly held by none, is loosely bound\r\nBy countless silken ties of love and thought\r\nTo everything on earth the compass round,\r\nAnd only by one\'s going slightly taut\r\nIn the capriciousness of summer air\r\nIs of the slightest bondage made aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nShall I Compare Thee to a Summer\'s Day?\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nShall I compare thee to a summer\'s day?\r\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\r\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\r\nAnd summer\'s lease hath all too short a date.\r\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\r\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\r\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\r\nBy chance, or nature\'s changing course untrimmed.\r\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\r\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\'st;\r\nNor shall death brag thou wand\'rest in his shade,\r\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\'st,\r\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\r\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Knew A Woman\r\nby Theodore Roethke\r\n\r\nI knew a woman, lovely in her bones,\r\nWhen small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;\r\nAh, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:\r\nThe shapes a bright container can contain!\r\nOf her choice virtues only gods should speak,\r\nOr English poets who grew up on Greek\r\n(I\'d have them sing in chorus, cheek to cheek.)\r\n\r\nHow well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,\r\nShe taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and stand;\r\nShe taught me Touch, that undulant white skin:\r\nI nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;\r\nShe was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,\r\nComing behind her for her pretty sake\r\n(But what prodigious mowing did we make.)\r\n\r\nLove likes a gander, and adores a goose:\r\nHer full lips pursed, the errant note to seize;\r\nShe played it quick, she played it light and loose;\r\nMy eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;\r\nHer several parts could keep a pure repose,\r\nOr one hip quiver with a mobile nose\r\n(She moved in circles, and those circles moved.)\r\n\r\nLet seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:\r\nI\'m martyr to a motion not my own;\r\nWhat\'s freedom for? To know eternity.\r\nI swear she cast a shadow white as stone.\r\nBut who would count eternity in days?\r\nThese old bones live to learn her wanton ways:\r\n(I measure time by how a body sways.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWho ever loved\r\nby Christopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is overruled by fate.\r\nWhen two are stripped, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should love, the other win;\r\n\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows; let it suffice\r\nWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever loved, that loved not at first sight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nsomewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond\r\nany experience,your eyes have their silence:\r\nin your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,\r\nor which i cannot touch because they are too near\r\nyour slightest look will easily unclose me\r\nthough i have closed myself as fingers,\r\nyou open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens\r\n(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose\r\nor if your wish be to close me, i and\r\nmy life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly,\r\nas when the heart of this flower imagines\r\nthe snow carefully everywhere descending;\r\nnothing which we are to perceive in this world equals\r\nthe power of your intense fragility:whose texture\r\ncompels me with the color of its countries,\r\nrendering death and forever with each breathing\r\n(i do not know what it is about you that closes\r\nand opens;only something in me understands\r\nthe voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)\r\nnobody,not even the rain,has such small hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night,\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors;\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart, we will forget him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nHeart, we will forget him,\r\nYou and I, tonight!\r\nYou must forget the warmth he gave,\r\nI will forget the light.\r\n\r\nWhen you have done pray tell me,\r\nThen I, my thoughts, will dim.\r\nHaste! \'lest while you\'re lagging\r\nI may remember him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA charm invests a face\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nA charm invests a face\r\nImperfectly beheld.\r\nThe lady dare not lift her veil\r\nFor fear it be dispelled.\r\n\r\nBut peers beyond her mesh,\r\nAnd wishes, and denies,\r\nLest interview annul a want\r\nThat image satisfies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave myself to him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nI gave myself to him,\r\nAnd took himself for pay.\r\nThe solemn contract of a life\r\nWas ratified this way\r\n\r\nThe value might disappoint,\r\nMyself a poorer prove\r\nThan this my purchaser suspect,\r\nThe daily own of Love\r\n\r\nDepreciates the sight;\r\nBut, \'til the merchant buy,\r\nStill fabled, in the isles of spice\r\nThe subtle cargoes lie.\r\n\r\nAt least, \'tis mutual risk,\r\nSome found it mutual gain;\r\nSweet debt of Life, each night to owe,\r\nInsolvent, every noon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarewell, Love\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\nFarewell, Love, and all thy laws for ever:\r\nThy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.\r\nSenec and Plato call me from thy lore,\r\nTo perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour.\r\nIn blind error when I did persever,\r\nThy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,\r\nHath taught me to set in trifles no store,\r\nAnd scape forth, since liberty is lever*.

H. Auden\r\n\r\nStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\r\nPrevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\r\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum\r\nBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\r\n\r\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\r\nScribbling on the sky the message He is Dead.\r\nPut crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\r\nLet the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\r\n\r\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West,\r\nMy working week and my Sunday rest,\r\nMy noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\r\nI thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\r\nPack up the moon and dismantle the sun,\r\nPour away the ocean and sweep up the woods;\r\nFor nothing now can ever come to any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Rose of Summer\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nTis the last rose of summer\r\nLeft blooming alone;\r\nAll her lovely companions\r\nAre faded and gone;\r\nNo flower of her kindred,\r\nNo rosebud is nigh,\r\nTo reflect back her blushes,\r\nTo give sigh for sigh.\r\n\r\nIll not leave thee, thou lone one!\r\nTo pine on the stem;\r\nSince the lovely are sleeping,\r\nGo, sleep thou with them.\r\nThus kindly I scatter\r\nThy leaves oer the bed,\r\nWhere thy mates of the garden\r\nLie scentless and dead.\r\n\r\nSo soon may I follow,\r\nWhen friendships decay,\r\nAnd from Loves shining circle\r\nThe gems drop away.\r\nWhen true hearts lie withered\r\nAnd fond ones are flown,\r\nOh! who would inhabit\r\nThis bleak world alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nTo what purpose, April, do you return again?\r\nBeauty is not enough.\r\nYou can no longer quiet me with the redness\r\nOf little leaves opening stickily.\r\nI know what I know.\r\nThe sun is hot on my neck as I observe\r\nThe spikes of the crocus.\r\nThe smell of the earth is good.\r\nIt is apparent that there is no death.\r\nBut what does that signify?\r\nNot only under ground are the brains of men \r\n\r\nEaten by maggots.\r\nLife in itself\r\nIs nothing,\r\nAn empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.\r\nIt is not enough that yearly, down this hill,\r\nApril\r\nComes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrockby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nS\'io credesse che mia risposta fosse\r\n A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\r\n Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.\r\n Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo\r\n Non torno vivo alcun, s\'i\'odo il vero,\r\nSenza tema d\'infamia ti rispondo. [1]\r\n\r\nLet us go then, you and I,\r\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\r\nLike a patient etherised upon a table;\r\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\r\nThe muttering retreats\r\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\r\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\r\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\r\nOf insidious intent\r\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question .\r\nOh, do not ask, What is it?\r\nLet us go and make our visit.\r\n\r\nIn the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the\r\nwindow-panes,\r\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\r\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\r\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\r\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\r\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\r\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\r\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there will be time\r\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\r\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\r\nThere will be time, there will be time\r\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\r\nThere will be time to murder and create,\r\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\r\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\r\nTime for you and time for me,\r\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\r\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\r\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\r\n\r\nIn the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there will be time\r\nTo wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?\r\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\r\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\r\n[They will say: How his hair is growing thin!]\r\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\r\n[They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!]\r\nDo I dare\r\nDisturb the universe?\r\nIn a minute there is time\r\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\nFor I have known them all already, known them all:\r\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\r\nSo how should I presume?\r\n\r\nAnd I have known the eyes already, known them all-\r\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\nThen how should I begin\r\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\nAnd how should I presume?\r\n\r\nAnd I have known the arms already, known them all-\r\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]\r\nIt is perfume from a dress\r\nThat makes me so digress?\r\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\nAnd should I then presume?\r\nAnd how should I begin?\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n..\r\n\r\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .\r\n\r\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n..\r\n\r\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\nSmoothed by long fingers,\r\nAsleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,\r\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\nThough I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,\r\nI am no prophetand here\'s no great matter;\r\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\nTo say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\r\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\nShould say: That is not what I meant at all.\r\nThat is not it, at all.\r\n\r\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\r\nfloor\r\nAnd this, and so much more?\r\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\nWould it have been worth while\r\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\r\nThat is not it at all,\r\nThat is not what I meant, at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n..\r\n\r\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\r\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\r\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\r\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\r\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\r\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\r\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\r\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\r\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\r\n\r\nI grow old . . . I grow old . . .\r\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\r\n\r\nShall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\r\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\r\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\r\n\r\nI do not think that they will sing to me.\r\n\r\nI have seen them riding seaward on the waves\r\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\r\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\r\n\r\nWe have lingered in the chambers of the sea\r\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\r\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\r\n\t\r\n[1] Dante, Inferno 27.61-66 If I thought my answer were\r\ngiven / to anyone who would ever return to the world, / this flame would stand\r\nstill without moving any further. / But since never from this abyss / has anyone\r\never returned alive, if what I hear is true, /without fear of infamy I answer\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTulips\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.\r\nLook how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.\r\nI am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly\r\nAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.\r\nI am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.\r\nI have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses\r\nAnd my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.\r\n\r\nThey have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff\r\nLike an eye between two white lids that will not shut.\r\nStupid pupil, it has to take everything in.\r\nThe nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,\r\nThey pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,\r\nDoing things with their hands, one just the same as another,\r\nSo it is impossible to tell how many there are.\r\n\r\nMy body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water\r\nTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.\r\nThey bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.\r\nNow I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\r\nMy patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,\r\nMy husband and child smiling out of the family photo;\r\nTheir smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.\r\n\r\nI have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat\r\nstubbornly hanging on to my name and address.\r\nThey have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.\r\nScared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley\r\nI watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books\r\nSink out of sight, and the water went over my head.\r\nI am a nun now, I have never been so pure.\r\n\r\nI didnt want any flowers, I only wanted\r\nTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.\r\nHow free it is, you have no idea how free\r\nThe peacefulness is so big it dazes you,\r\nAnd it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.\r\nIt is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them\r\nShutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.\r\nEven through the gift paper I could hear them breathe\r\nLightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.\r\nTheir redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.\r\nThey are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,\r\nUpsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,\r\nA dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.\r\n\r\nNobody watched me before, now I am watched.\r\nThe tulips turn to me, and the window behind me\r\nWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,\r\nAnd I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow\r\nBetween the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,\r\nAnd I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.\r\nThe vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\r\n\r\nBefore they came the air was calm enough,\r\nComing and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.\r\nThen the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.\r\nNow the air snags and eddies round them the way a river\r\nSnags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.\r\nThey concentrate my attention, that was happy\r\nPlaying and resting without committing itself.\r\n\r\nThe walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.\r\nThe tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;\r\nThey are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,\r\nAnd I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes\r\nIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.\r\nThe water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,\r\nAnd comes from a country far away as health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Confession\r\nby the Archpoet\r\ncirca 1165; translated from the original Medieval Latin\r\nby Helen Waddell\r\n\r\n\r\nSeething over inwardly\r\nWith fierce indignation,\r\nIn my bitterness of soul,\r\nHear my declaration.\r\nI am of one element,\r\nLevity my matter,\r\nLike enough a withered leaf\r\nFor the winds to scatter.\r\n\r\nSince it is the property\r\nOf the sapient\r\nTo sit firm upon a rock,\r\nit is evident\r\nThat I am a fool, since I\r\nAm a flowing river,\r\nNever under the same sky,\r\nTransient for ever.\r\n\r\nHither, thither, masterless\r\nShip upon the sea,\r\nWandering through the ways of air,\r\nGo the birds like me.\r\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\r\nPrisoner to no key,\r\nQuesting go I for my kind,\r\nFind depravity.\r\n\r\nNever yet could I endure\r\nSoberness and sadness,\r\nJests I love and sweeter than\r\nHoney find I gladness.\r\nWhatsoever Venus bids\r\nIs a joy excelling,\r\nNever in an evil heart\r\nDid she make her dwelling.\r\n\r\nDown the broad way do I go,\r\nYoung and unregretting,\r\nWrap me in my vices up,\r\nVirtue all forgetting,\r\nGreedier for all delight\r\nThan heaven to enter in:\r\nSince the soul is in me dead,\r\nBetter save the skin.\r\n\r\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\r\nMaster of discretion,\r\nBut this death I die is sweet,\r\nMost delicious poison.\r\nWounded to the quick am I\r\nBy a young girl\'s beauty:\r\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\r\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\r\n\r\nHard beyond all hardness, this\r\nMastering of Nature:\r\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\r\nNear so fair a creature?\r\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\r\nHow should we obey it?\r\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\r\nShall they have no say int?\r\n\r\nSit you down amid the fire,\r\nWill the fire not burn you?\r\nTo Pavia come, will you\r\nJust as chaste return you?\r\nPavia, where Beauty draws\r\nYouth with finger-tips,\r\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\r\nRavished with her lips.\r\n\r\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\r\nIn Pavia dine him,\r\nNever more Hippolytus\r\nWill the morning find him.\r\nIn Pavia not a road\r\nBut leads to venery\r\nNor among its crowding towers\r\nOne to chastity.\r\n\r\nYet a second charge they bring:\r\nI\'m forever gaming.\r\nYea, the dice hath many a time\r\nStripped me to my shaming.\r\nWhat an\' if the body\'s cold,\r\nIf the mind is burning,\r\nOn the anvil hammering,\r\nRhymes and verses turning?\r\n\r\nLook again upon your list.\r\nIs the tavern on it?\r\nYea, and never have I scorned,\r\nNever shall I scorn it,\r\nTill the holy angels come,\r\nAnd my eyes discern them,\r\nSinging for the dying soul,\r\nRequiem aeternam.\r\n\r\nFor on this my heart is set:\r\nWhen the hour is nigh me,\r\nLet me in the tavern die,\r\nWith a tankard by me,\r\nWhile the angels looking down\r\nJoyously sing o\'er me,\r\nDeus sit propitius\r\nHuic potatori.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\r\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\r\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\r\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\r\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\r\nIn a tavern tankard\r\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\r\nBishop has decanted.\r\n\r\nLet them fast and water drink,\r\nAll the poets\' chorus,\r\nFly the market and the crowd\r\nRacketing uproarious.\r\nSit in quiet spots and think,\r\nShun the tavern\'s portal\r\nWrite, and never having lived,\r\nDie to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNever hath the spirit of\r\nPoetry descended,\r\nTill with food and drink my lean\r\nBelly was distended,\r\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\r\nMy cerebral story,\r\nComes Apollo with a rush,\r\nFills me with his glory.\r\n\r\nUnto every man his gift.\r\nMine was not for fasting.\r\nNever could I find a rhyme\r\nWith my stomach wasting.\r\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\r\n\'Tis a better chorus\r\nWhen the landlord hath a good\r\nVintage set before us.\r\n\r\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\r\nI myself betray me,\r\nAnd affirm myself to be\r\nAll my fellows say me.\r\nSee, they in thy presence are:\r\nLet whoeer hath known\r\nHis own heart and found it clean,\r\nCast at me the stone.\r\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best erotic poems ever, according to me. I\'m sure every \r\nreader\'s choices will be different, but if you added a poem or three to yours, \r\nhaving read mine, hopefully you will consider your time here well spent.

Burch\r\n\r\nA black ringlet\r\ncurls to lie\r\nat the nape of her neck,\r\nglistening with sweat\r\nin the evaporate moonlight ...\r\nThis is what I remember\r\n\r\nnow that I cannot forget.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight,\r\nif I have forgotten her name,\r\nI remember:\r\nrigid wire and white lace\r\nhalf-impressed in her flesh ...\r\n\r\nour soft cries, like regret,\r\n\r\n... the enameled white clips\r\nof her bra strap\r\nstill inscribe dimpled marks\r\nthat my kisses erase ...\r\n\r\nnow that I have forgotten her face.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre You the Thief\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I touch you now,\r\nO sweet lover,\r\nfull of fire,\r\nmelting like ice\r\nin my embrace,\r\nwhen I part the delicate white lace,\r\nbaring pale flesh,\r\nand your face\r\nis so close\r\nthat I breathe your breath\r\nand your hair surrounds me like a wreath ... \r\ntell me now,\r\nO sweet, sweet lover,\r\nin good faith:\r\nare you the thief\r\nwho has stolen my heart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRighteous\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nCome to me tonight\r\nin the twilight, O, and the full moon rising,\r\nspectral and ancient, will mutter a prayer.\r\n\r\nGather your hair\r\nand pin it up, knowing\r\nthat I will release it a moment anon.\r\n\r\nWe are not one,\r\nnor is there a scripture\r\nto sanctify nights you might spend in my arms,\r\n\r\nbut the swarms\r\nof stars revolving above us\r\nrevel tonight, the most ardent of lovers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuet, Minor Key\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nWithout the drama of cymbals\r\nor the fanfare and snares of drums,\r\nI present my case\r\nstripped of its fine veneer:\r\nBehold, thy instrument. \r\nPlay, for the night is long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOnce when her kisses were fire incarnate\r\nand left in their imprint bright lipstick, and flame,\r\nwhen her breath rose and fell over smoldering dunes,\r\nleaving me listlessly sighing her name ...\r\n\r\nOnce when her breasts were as pale, as beguiling,\r\nas wan rivers of sand shedding heat like a mist,\r\nwhen her words would at times softly, mildly rebuke me\r\nall the while as her lips did more wildly insist ...\r\n\r\nOnce when the thought of her echoed and whispered\r\nthrough vast wastelands of need like a Bedouin chant,\r\nI ached for the touch of her lips with such longing\r\nthat I vowed all my former vows to recant ...\r\n\r\nOnce, only once, something bloomed, of a desiccate seed\r\nthis implausible blossom her wild rains of kisses decreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Goes Around, Comes\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThis is a poem about loss\r\nso why do you toss your dark hair\r\nunaccountably glowing? \r\nHow can you be sure of my heart\r\nwhen its beyond my own knowing? \r\nOr is it loves pheromones you trust,\r\nmy eyes magnetized by your bust\r\nand the mysterious alchemies of lust? \r\nNow I am truly lost!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Erotic Poems of Note\r\n\r\nBasket of Figs by Ellen Bass\r\nAt the Touch of You by Witter Bynner\r\nTaking Off Emily Dickinson\'s Clothes by Billy Collins\r\nWarming Her Pearls by Carol Ann Duffy\r\nThe Encounter by Louise Gluck\r\nAssurance by Emma Lazarus\r\nRecreation by Audre Lorde\r\nAubade by Amy Lowell\r\nIf You Forget Me by Pablo Neruda\r\nLove Sonnet XI by Pablo Neruda\r\nLove Sonnet XVII by Pablo Neruda\r\n\r\nErotic Songs of Note\r\n\r\nCriminal by Fiona Apple\r\nI\'ll Make Love to You by Boyz II Men\r\nWishing Well by Terrence Trent D\'Arby\r\nLight My Fire by the Doors\r\nLay Lady Lay by Bob Dylan\r\nFeel Like Makin\' Love by Roberta Flack\r\nThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack\r\nSledgehammer by Peter Gabriel \r\nSexual Healing by Marvin Gaye\r\nLet\'s Get It On by Marvin Gaye\r\nLover Man by Billie Holiday \r\nWicked Game by Chris Isaak \r\nShe Bop by Cyndi Lauper\r\nLady Marmalade by Patti Labelle\r\nLike a Virgin by Madonna\r\nUntil the Night by Benny Mardones\r\nTurn Your Lights Down Low by Bob Marley and the Wailers\r\nI Want Your Sex by George Michael \r\nPhysical by Olivia Newton-John\r\nToo Close by Next\r\nFever by Elvis Presley\r\nRaspberry Beret by Prince\r\nLittle Red Corvette by Prince\r\nKiss by Prince\r\nTutti Frutti by Little Richard\r\nUnchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers\r\nThe Sweetest Taboo by Sade\r\nI Put a Spell on You by Nina Simone\r\nI\'m On Fire by Bruce Springsteen \r\nTonight\'s the Night by Rod Stewart\r\nLove to Love You Baby by Donna Summer\r\nHot Stuff by Donna Summer\r\nBad Girls by Donna Summer\r\nClimax by Usher\r\nRing My Bell by Anita Ward\r\nUse Me by Bill Withers\r\n\r\nMore Erotica:\r\nUnmentionables, \r\nVisible Panty Line,\r\nUpskirts,\r\nVisions of Beauty\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nMichael R.
