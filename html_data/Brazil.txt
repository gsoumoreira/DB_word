1
officially
the
Federative
Republic
of
Brazil
(Portuguese:
República
Federativa
do
Brasil),10
is
the
largest
country
in
both
South
America
and
Latin
America.
At
8.5million
square
kilometers
(3.2million
square
miles)11
and
with
over
211
million
people,
Brazil
is
the
world's
fifth-largest
country
by
area
and
the
sixth
most
populous.
Its
capital
is
Brasília,
and
its
most
populous
city
is
São
Paulo.
The
federation
is
composed
of
the
union
of
the
26
states
and
the
Federal
District.
It
is
the
largest
country
to
have
Portuguese
as
an
official
language
and
the
only
one
in
the
Americas;1213
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
multicultural
and
ethnically
diverse
nations,
due
to
over
a
century
of
mass
immigration
from
around
the
world.14
Bounded
by
the
Atlantic
Ocean
on
the
east,
Brazil
has
a
coastline
of
7,491
kilometers
(4,655mi).15
It
borders
all
other
countries
in
South
America
except
Ecuador
and
Chile
and
covers
47.3%
of
the
continent's
land
area.16
Its
Amazon
River
basin
includes
a
vast
tropical
forest,
home
to
diverse
wildlife,
a
variety
of
ecological
systems,
and
extensive
natural
resources
spanning
numerous
protected
habitats.15
This
unique
environmental
heritage
makes
Brazil
one
of
17
megadiverse
countries,
and
is
the
subject
of
significant
global
interest
and
debate
regarding
deforestation
and
environmental
protection.
Brazil
was
inhabited
by
numerous
tribal
nations
prior
to
the
landing
in
1500
of
explorer
Pedro
Álvares
Cabral,
who
claimed
the
area
for
the
Portuguese
Empire.
Brazil
remained
a
Portuguese
colony
until
1808,
when
the
capital
of
the
empire
was
transferred
from
Lisbon
to
Rio
de
Janeiro.
In
1815,
the
colony
was
elevated
to
the
rank
of
kingdom
upon
the
formation
of
the
United
Kingdom
of
Portugal,
Brazil
and
the
Algarves.
Independence
was
achieved
in
1822
with
the
creation
of
the
Empire
of
Brazil,
a
unitary
state
governed
under
a
constitutional
monarchy
and
a
parliamentary
system.
The
ratification
of
the
first
constitution
in
1824
led
to
the
formation
of
a
bicameral
legislature,
now
called
the
National
Congress.
The
country
became
a
presidential
republic
in
1889
following
a
military
coup
d'état.
An
authoritarian
military
junta
came
to
power
in
1964
and
ruled
until
1985,
after
which
civilian
governance
resumed.
Brazil's
current
constitution,
formulated
in
1988,
defines
it
as
a
democratic
federal
republic.17
Due
to
its
rich
culture
and
history,
the
country
ranks
thirteenth
in
the
world
by
number
of
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Sites.18
Brazil
is
classified
as
an
upper-middle
income
economy
by
the
World
Bank19
and
a
newly
industrialized
country,20
with
the
largest
share
of
global
wealth
in
Latin
America.
It
is
considered
an
advanced
emerging
economy.21
It
has
the
ninth
largest
GDP
in
the
world
by
nominal,
and
eight
by
PPP
measures.2223
It
is
one
of
the
world's
major
breadbaskets,
being
the
largest
producer
of
coffee
for
the
last
150
years.24
Brazil
is
a
regional
power
and
sometimes
considered
a
great252627
or
a

in
international
affairs.272829303126
On
account
of
its
international
recognition
and
influence,
the
country
is
subsequently
classified
as
an
emerging
power32

a
potential
superpower
by

Etymology
Main
article:
Name
of
Brazil
The
word
"Brazil"
likely
comes
from
the
Portuguese
word
for
brazilwood,
a
tree
that
once
grew
plentifully
along
the
Brazilian
coast.36
In
Portuguese,
brazilwood
is
called
pau-brasil,
with
the
word
brasil
commonly
given
the
etymology
"red
like
an
ember",
formed
from
brasa
("ember")
and
the
suffix
-il
(from
-iculum
or
-ilium).37
As
brazilwood
produces
a
deep
red
dye,
it
was
highly
valued
by
the
European
textile
industry
and
was
the
earliest
commercially
exploited
product
from
Brazil.38
Throughout
the
16th
century,
massive
amounts
of
brazilwood
were
harvested
by
indigenous
peoples
(mostly
Tupi)
along
the
Brazilian
coast,
who
sold
the
timber
to
European
traders
(mostly
Portuguese,
but
also
French)
in
return
for
assorted
European
consumer
goods.39
The
official
Portuguese
name
of
the
land,
in
original
Portuguese
records,
was
the
"Land
of
the
Holy
Cross"
(Terra
da
Santa
Cruz),40
but
European
sailors
and
merchants
commonly
called
it
simply
the
"Land
of
Brazil"
(Terra
do
Brasil)
because
of
the
brazilwood
trade.41
The
popular
appellation
eclipsed
and
eventually
supplanted
the
official
Portuguese
name.
Some
early
sailors
called
it
the
"Land
of
Parrots".42
In
the
Guarani
language,
an
official
language
of
Paraguay,
Brazil
is
called
"Pindorama".
This
was
the
name
the
indigenous
population
gave
to
the
region,
meaning
"land
of
the
palm
trees".43

That
culture
appeared
to
flourish
between
400
AD
and
1400
AD,
based
on
archeological
studies.45
Some
of
the
earliest
human
remains
found
in
the
Americas,
Luzia
Woman,
were
found
in
the
area
of
Pedro
Leopoldo,
Minas
Gerais
and
provide
evidence
of
human
habitation
going
back
at
least
11,000
years.4647
The
earliest
pottery
ever
found
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
was
excavated
in
the
Amazon
basin
of
Brazil
and
radiocarbon
dated
to
8,000
years
ago
(6000
BC).
The
pottery
was
found
near
Santarém
and
provides
evidence
that
the
tropical
forest
region
supported
a
complex
prehistoric
culture.48
The
Marajoara
culture
flourished
on
Marajó
in
the
Amazon
delta
from
400
CE
to
1400
CE,
developing
sophisticated
pottery,
social
stratification,
large
populations,
mound
building,
and
complex
social
formations
such
as
chiefdoms.45
Around
the
time
of
the
Portuguese
arrival,
the
territory
of
current
day
Brazil
had
an
estimated
indigenous
population
of
7
million
people,49
mostly
semi-nomadic,
who
subsisted
on
hunting,
fishing,
gathering,
and
migrant
agriculture.
The
indigenous
population
of
Brazil
comprised
several
large
indigenous
ethnic
groups
(e.g.
the
Tupis,
Guaranis,
Gês
and
Arawaks).
The
Tupí
people
were
subdivided
into
the
Tupiniquins
and
Tupinambás,
and
there
were
also
many
subdivisions
of
the
other
groups.50
Before
the
arrival
of
the
Europeans,
the
boundaries
between
these
groups
and
their
subgroups
were
marked
by
wars
that
arose
from
differences
in
culture,
language
and
moral
beliefs.51
These
wars
also
involved
large-scale
military
actions
on
land
and
water,
with
cannibalistic
rituals
on
prisoners
of
war.5253
While
heredity
had
some
weight,
leadership
status
was
more
subdued
over
time,
than
allocated
in
succession
ceremonies
and
conventions.51
Slavery
among
the
Indians
had
a
different
meaning
than
it
had
for
Europeans,
since
it
originated
from
a
diverse
socioeconomic
organization,
in
which
asymmetries
were
translated
into
kinship
relations.54

of

of
Pedro
Álvares
Cabral
in
Porto
Seguro,
1500.
Painting
of
1922.
The
land
now
called
Brazil
was
claimed
for
the
Portuguese
Empire
on
22
April
1500,
with
the
arrival
of
the
Portuguese
fleet
commanded
by
Pedro
Álvares
Cabral.55
The
Portuguese
encountered
indigenous
peoples
divided
into
several
tribes,
most
of
whom
spoke
languages
of
the
Tupi–Guarani
family,
and
fought
among
themselves.56
Though
the
first
settlement
was
founded
in
1532,
colonization
effectively
began
in
1534,
when
King
JohnIII
of
Portugal
divided
the
territory
into
the
fifteen
private
and
autonomous
Captaincy
Colonies
of
Brazil.5758
However,
the
decentralized
and
unorganized
tendencies
of
the
captaincy
colonies
proved
problematic,
and
in
1549
the
Portuguese
king
restructured
them
into
the
Governorate
General
of
Brazil
in
the
city
of
Salvador,
which
became
the
capital
of
a
single
and
centralized
Portuguese
colony
in

By
the
end
of
the

century,
sugarcane
exports
began
to
decline,70
and
the
discovery
of
gold
by
bandeirantes
in
the
1690s
would
become
the
new
backbone
of
the
colony's
economy,
fostering
a
Brazilian
Gold
Rush71
which
attracted
thousands
of
new
settlers
to
Brazil
from
Portugal
and
all
Portuguese
colonies
around
the
world.72
This
increased
level
of
immigration
in
turn
caused
some
conflicts
between
newcomers
and
old
settlers.73
Portuguese
expeditions
known
as
Bandeiras
gradually
advanced
the
Portugal
colonial
original
frontiers
in
South
America
to
approximately
the
current
Brazilian
borders.7475
In
this
era
other
European
powers
tried
to
colonize
parts
of
Brazil,
in
incursions
that
the
Portuguese
had
to
fight,
notably
the
French
in
Rio
during
the
1560s,
in
Maranhão
during
the
1610s,
and
the
Dutch
in
Bahia
and
Pernambuco,
during
the
Dutch–Portuguese
War,
after
the
end
of
Iberian
Union.76
The
Portuguese
colonial
administration
in
Brazil
had
two
objectives
that
would
ensure
colonial
order
and
the
monopoly
of
Portugal's
wealthiest
and
largest
colony:
to
keep
under
control
and
eradicate
all
forms
of
slave
rebellion
and
resistance,
such
as
the
Quilombo
of
Palmares,77
and
to

all
movements
for

The

VI
of

of
Portugal,

the
Algarves
in
Rio
de
Janeiro,
6
February
1818
In
late
1807,
Spanish
and
Napoleonic
forces
threatened
the
security
of
continental
Portugal,
causing
Prince
Regent
João,
in
the
name
of
Queen
Maria
I,
to
move
the
royal
court
from
Lisbon
to
Rio
de
Janeiro.79
There
they
established
some
of
Brazil's
first
financial
institutions,
such
as
its
local
stock
exchanges,80
and
its
National
Bank,
additionally
ending
the
Portuguese
monopoly
on
Brazilian
trade
and
opening
Brazil
to
other
nations.
In
1809,
in
retaliation
for
being
forced
into
exile,
the
Prince
Regent
ordered
the
Portuguese
conquest
of
French
Guiana.81
With
the
end
of
the
Peninsular
War
in
1814,
the
courts
of
Europe
demanded
that
Queen
Maria
I
and
Prince
Regent
João
return
to
Portugal,
deeming
it
unfit
for
the
head
of
an
ancient
European
monarchy
to
reside
in
a
colony.
In
1815,
to
justify
continuing
to
live
in
Brazil,
where
the
royal
court
had
thrived
for
six
years,
the
Crown
established
the
United
Kingdom
of
Portugal,
Brazil,
and
the
Algarves,
thus
creating
a
pluricontinental
transatlantic
monarchic
state.82
However,
the
leadership
in
Portugal,
resentful
of
the
new
status
of
its
larger
colony,
continued
to
demand
the
return
of
court
to
Lisbon
(v.
Liberal
Revolution
of
1820).
In
1821,
acceding
to
the
demands
of
revolutionaries
who
had
taken
the
city
of
Porto,83
D.
João
VI
departed
for
Lisbon.
There
he
swore
an
oath
to
the
new
constitution,
leaving
his
son,
Prince
Pedro
de

as

of

the

guided
by
the

by

Pedro
II,
Emperor
of
Brazil
between
1831
and
1889.
As
the
new
Emperor
could
not
exert
his
constitutional
powers
until
he
came
of
age,
a
regency
was
set
up
by
the
National
Assembly.93
In
the
absence
of
a
charismatic
figure
who
could
represent
a
moderate
face
of
power,
during
this
period
a
series
of
localized
rebellions
took
place,
such
as
the
Cabanagem
in
Grão-Pará
Province,
the
Malê
Revolt
in
Salvador
da
Bahia,
the
Balaiada
(Maranhão),
the
Sabinada
(Bahia),
and
the
Ragamuffin
War,
which
began
in
Rio
Grande
do
Sul
and
was
supported
by
Giuseppe
Garibaldi.
These
emerged
from
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
provinces
with
the
central
power,
coupled
with
old
and
latent
social
tensions
peculiar
to
a
vast,
slaveholding
and
newly
independent
nation
state.94
This
period
of
internal
political
and
social
upheaval,
which
included
the
Praieira
revolt
in
Pernambuco,
was
overcome
only
at
the
end
of
the
1840s,
years
after
the
end
of
the
regency,
which
occurred
with
the
premature
coronation
of
Pedro
II
in
1841.95
During
the
last
phase
of
the
monarchy,
internal
political
debate
centered
on
the
issue
of
slavery.
The
Atlantic
slave
trade
was
abandoned
in
1850,96
as
a
result
of
the
British
Aberdeen
Act,
but
only
in
May
1888
after
a
long
process
of
internal
mobilization
and
debate
for
an
ethical
and
legal
dismantling
of
slavery
in
the
country,
was
the
institution
formally
abolished.97
The
foreign-affairs
policies
of
the
monarchy
dealt
with
issues
with
the
countries
of
the
Southern
Cone
with
whom
Brazil
had
borders.
Long
after
the
Cisplatine
War
that
resulted
in
independence
for
Uruguay,98
Brazil
won
three
international
wars
during
the
58-year
reign
of
PedroII.
These
were
the
Platine
War,
the
Uruguayan
War
and
the
devastating
Paraguayan
War,
the
largest
war
effort
in
Brazilian
history.99100
Although
there
was
no
desire
among
the
majority
of
Brazilians
to
change
the
country's
form
of
government,101
on
15
November
1889,
in
disagreement
with
the
majority
of
Army
officers,
as
well
as
with
rural
and

(for
different
reasons),
the

in

Freedom

a

cycle

by

both

In

was
the

to
send

Little
by
little,
a
cycle
of
general
instability
sparked
by
these
crises
undermined
the
regime
to
such
an
extent
that
in
the

of
the

of
his
running
mate,
the
defeated
opposition
presidential
candidate
Getúlio
Vargas,
supported
by
most
of
the
military,
successfully
led
the
October
1930
Coup.123124
Vargas
and
the
military
were
supposed
to
assume
power
temporarily,
but
instead
closed
the
Congress,
extinguished
the
Constitution,
ruled
with
emergency
powers
and
replaced
the
states'
governors
with
their
own
supporters.125126
In
the
1930s,
three
failed
attempts
to
remove
Vargas
and
his
supporters
from
power
occurred.
The
first
was
the
Constitutionalist
Revolution
in
1932,
led
by
the
Paulista
oligarchy.
The
second
was
a
Communist
uprising
in

1935,
and
the
last
one
a
putsch
attempt
by
local
fascists
in
May
1938.127128129
The
1935
uprising
created
a
security
crisis
in
which
the
Congress
transferred
more
power
to
the
executive.
The
1937
coup
d'état
resulted
in
the
cancellation
of
the
1938
election,
formalized
Vargas
as
dictator,
beginning
the
Estado
Novo
era,
which
was
noted
for
government
brutality
and
censorship
of
the
press.130
Foreign
policy
during
Vargas
years
was
marked
by
the
antecedentsclarification
needed
and
World
War
II.
Brazil
remained
neutral
until
August
1942,
when
the
country
entered
on
the
allied
side,131132
after
suffering
retaliation
by
Nazi
Germany
and
Fascist
Italy,
in
a
strategic
dispute
over
the
South
Atlantic.133
In
addition
to
its
participation
in
the
battle
of
the
Atlantic,
Brazil
also
sent
an
expeditionary
force
to
fight
in
the
Italian
campaign.134
With
the
Allied
victory
in
1945
and
the
end
of
the
Nazi-fascist
regimes
in
Europe,
Vargas's
position
became
unsustainable
and
he
was
swiftly
overthrown
in
another
military
coup,
with
democracy
"reinstated"
by
the
same
army
that
had
ended
it
15
years
earlier.135

Quadros,
resigned

less
than
a
year
after
taking
office.142
His
vice-president,
João
Goulart,
assumed
the

but
aroused
strong
political
opposition143
and
was
deposed
in
April
1964
by
a
coup
that
resulted
in
a
military
regime.144
The
new
regime
was
intended
to
be
transitory145
but
gradually
closed
in
on
itself
and
became
a
full
dictatorship
with
the
promulgation
of
the
Fifth
Institutional
Act
in
1968.146
Oppression
was
not
limited
to
those
who
resorted
to
guerrilla
tactics
to
fight
the
regime,
but
also
reached
institutional
opponents,
artists,
journalists
and
other
members
of
civil
society,147148
inside
and
outside
the
country
through
the
infamous
"Operation
Condor".149150
Despite
its
brutality,
like
other
authoritarian
regimes,
due
to
an
economic
boom,
known
as
an
"economic
miracle",
the
regime
reached
a
peak
in
popularity
in
the
early
1970s.151
Slowly
however,
the
wear
and
tear
of
years
of
dictatorial
power
that
had
not
slowed
the
repression,
even
after
the
defeat
of
the
leftist
guerrillas,152
plus
the
inability
to
deal
with
the
economic
crises
of
the
period
and
popular
pressure,
made
an
opening
policy
inevitable,
which
from
the
regime
side
was
led
by
Generals
Ernesto
Geisel
and

With
the
enactment
of
the

Law
in
1979,
Brazil
began
a
slow
return
to
democracy,
which
was
completed
during
the
1980s.95
Civilians
returned
to
power
in
1985
when
José
Sarney
assumed
the
presidency.
He
became
unpopular
during
his
tenure
through
failure
to
control
the
economic
crisis
and
hyperinflation
he
inherited
from
the
military
regime.154
Sarney's
unsuccessful
government
led
to
the
election
in
1989
of
the
almost-unknown
Fernando
Collor,
subsequently
impeached
by
the
National

in

Collor
was
succeeded
by
his
vice-president,
Itamar
Franco,
who

successful

that,
after

of
failed
economic
plans
made
by

The
climate
of
Brazil
comprises
a
wide
range
of
weather
conditions
across
a
large
area
and
varied
topography,
but
most
of
the
country
is
tropical.15
According
to
the
Köppen
system,
Brazil
hosts
six
major
climatic
subtypes:
desert,
equatorial,
tropical,
semiarid,
oceanic
and
subtropical.
The
different
climatic
conditions
produce
environments
ranging
from
equatorial
rainforests
in
the
north
and
semiarid
deserts
in
the
northeast,
to
temperate
coniferous
forests
in
the
south
and
tropical
savannas
in
central
Brazil.180
Many
regions
have
starkly
different
microclimates.181182
An
equatorial
climate
characterizes
much
of
northern
Brazil.
There
is
no
real
dry
season,
but
there
are
some
variations
in
the
period
of
the
year
when
most
rain
falls.180
Temperatures
average
25°C
(77°F),182
with
more
significant
temperature
variation
between
night
and
day
than
between
seasons.181
Over
central
Brazil
rainfall
is
more
seasonal,
characteristic
of
a
savanna
climate.181
This
region
is
as
extensive
as
the
Amazon
basin
but
has
a
very
different
climate
as
it
lies
farther
south
at
a
higher
altitude.180
In
the
interior
northeast,
seasonal
rainfall
is
even
more
extreme.183
The
semiarid
climatic
region
generally
receives
less
than
800
millimetres
(31.5in)
of
rain,183
most
of
which
generally
falls
in
a
period
of
three
to
five
months
of
the
year184
and
occasionally
less
than
this,
creating
long
periods
of
drought.181
Brazil's
1877–78
Grande
Seca
(Great
Drought),
the
worst
in
Brazil's
history,185
caused
approximately
half
a
million
deaths.186

similarly
devastating
drought
occurred
in
1915.187

with

falling
throughout
the
year.180
The

subtropical
conditions,
with
cool
winters
and
average
annual

Brazil's
Amazon
Basin
is
home
to
an
extremely
diverse
array
of
fish
species,
including
the
red-bellied
piranha.
By
2013,
Brazil's
"dramatic
policy-driven
reduction
in
Amazon
Basin
deforestation"
was
a
"global
exception
in
terms
of
forest

according
to
scientific
journal
Science.192:852
From
2003
to
2011,
compared
to
all

countries
in
the

Brazil
had

Speaking
at

criticised

"It
is
a

and
a
misconception,
as
confirmed
by

to
say
that

Using
these
fallacies,
certain

Affairs
Brazil's
international
relations
are
based
on
Article
4
of
the
Federal
Constitution,
which
establishes
non-intervention,
self-determination,
international
cooperation
and
the
peaceful
settlement
of
conflicts
as
the
guiding
principles
of
Brazil's
relationship
with
other
countries
and
multilateral
organizations.237
According
to
the
Constitution,
the
President
has
ultimate
authority
over
foreign
policy,
while
the
Congress
is
tasked
with
reviewing
and
considering
all
diplomatic
nominations
and
international
treaties,
as
well
as
legislation
relating
to
Brazilian
foreign
policy.238
Brazil's
foreign
policy
is
a
by-product
of
the
country's
position
as
a
regional
power
in
Latin
America,
a
leader
among
developing
countries,
and
an
emerging
world
power.239
Brazilian
foreign
policy
has
generally
been
based
on
the
principles
of
multilateralism,
peaceful
dispute
settlement,
and
non-intervention
in
the
affairs
of
other
countries.240
Brazil
is
a
founding
member
state
of
the
Community
of
Portuguese
Language
Countries
(CPLP),
also
known
as
the
Lusophone
Commonwealth,
an
international
organization
and
political
association
of
Lusophone
nations
across
four
continents,
where
Portuguese
is
an
official
language.
An
increasingly
well-developed
tool
of
Brazil's
foreign
policy
is
providing
aid
as
a
donor
to
other
developing
countries.241
Brazil
does
not
just
use
its
growing
economic
strength
to
provide
financial
aid,
but
it
also
provides
high
levels
of
expertise
and
most
importantly
of
all,
a
quiet
non-confrontational
diplomacy
to
improve
governance
levels.241
Total
aid
is
estimated
to
be
around
$1billion
per
year,
which
includes:241
Diplomatic
missions
of
Brazil
technical
cooperation
of
around
$480million
($30million
in
2010

by
the
Brazilian
Cooperation
Agency
(ABC));
estimated
$450million
for
in-kind
expertise
provided
by
Brazilian
institutions
specializing
in
technical
cooperation.
In
addition,
Brazil
manages
a
peacekeeping
mission
in
Haiti
($350million)
and
makes
in-kind
contributions
to
the
World
Food
Programme
($300million).241
This
is
in
addition
to
humanitarian
assistance
and
contributions
to
multilateral
development
agencies.
The
scale
of
this
aid
places
it
on
par
with
China
and
India.241
The
Brazilian
South-South
aid
has
been
described
as
a
"global

In
Brazil,
the
Constitution
establishes
five
different
police
agencies
for
law
enforcement:
Federal
Police
Department,
Federal
Highway
Police,
Federal
Railroad
Police,
Military
Police
and
Civil
Police.
Of
these,
the
first
three
are
affiliated
with
federal
authorities
and
the
last
two
are
subordinate
to
state
governments.
All
police
forces
are
the
responsibility
of
the
executive
branch
of
any
of
the
federal
or
state
powers.17
The
National
Public
Security
Force
also
can
act
in
public
disorder
situations
arising
anywhere
in
the
country.243
The
country
still
has
above-average
levels
of
violent
crime
and
particularly
high
levels
of
gun
violence
and
homicide.
In
2012,
the
World
Health
Organization
(WHO)
estimated
the
number
of
32
deaths
per
100,000
inhabitants,
one
of
the
highest
rates
of
homicide
of
the
world.244
The
number
considered
tolerable
by
the
WHO
is
about
10
homicides
per
100,000
inhabitants.245
In
2018,
Brazil
had
a
record
63,880
murders.246
However,
there
are
differences
between
the
crime
rates
in
the
Brazilian
states.
While
in
São
Paulo
the
homicide
rate
registered
in
2013
was
10.8
deaths
per
100,000
inhabitants,
in
Alagoas
it
was
64.7
homicides
per
100,000
inhabitants.247
Brazil
also
has
high
levels
of
incarceration
and
the
third
largest
prison
population
in
the
world
(behind
only
China
and
the
United
States),
with
an
estimated
total
of
approximately
700,000
prisoners
around
the
country
(June
2014),
an
increase
of
about
300%
compared
to
the
index
registered
in
1992.248
The
high
number
of
prisoners
eventually
overloaded
the
Brazilian
prison
system,
leading
to
a
shortfall
of
about
200,000
accommodations.249

Brazil
is
a
federation
composed
of
26
states,
one
federal
district,
and
the
5570
municipalities.17
States
have
autonomous
administrations,
collect
their
own
taxes
and
receive
a
share
of
taxes
collected
by
the
Federal
government.
They
have
a
governor
and
a
unicameral
legislative
body
elected
directly
by
their
voters.
They
also
have
independent
Courts
of
Law
for
common
justice.
Despite
this,
states
have
much
less
autonomy
to
create
their
own
laws
than
in
the
United
States.
For
example,
criminal
and
civil
laws
can
be
voted
by
only
the
federal
bicameral
Congress
and
are
uniform
throughout
the
country.17
The
states
and
the
federal
district
may
be
grouped
into
regions:
Northern,
Northeast,
Central-West,
Southeast
and
Southern.
The
Brazilian
regions
are
merely
geographical,
not
political
or
administrative
divisions,
and
they
do
not
have
any
specific
form
of
government.
Although
defined
by
law,
Brazilian
regions
are
useful
mainly
for
statistical
purposes,
and
also
to
define
the
distribution
of
federal
funds
in
development
projects.
Municipalities,
as
the
states,
have
autonomous
administrations,
collect
their
own
taxes
and
receive
a
share
of
taxes
collected
by
the
Union
and
state
government.17
Each
has
a
mayor
and
an
elected
legislative
body,
but
no
separate
Court
of
Law.
Indeed,
a
Court
of
Law
organized
by
the
state
can
encompass
many
municipalities
in
a
single
justice
administrative
division
called
comarca
(county).

2007–08.287288289
In
spite
of
this
trend,
revenues
from
international
tourism
continued
to
rise,
from
USD
4billion
in
2005
to
5billion
in
2007,
despite
330
000
fewer
arrivals.
This
favorable
trend
is
the
result
of
the
strong
devaluation
of
the
US
dollar
against
the
Brazilian
Real,
which
began
in
2004,
but
which
makes
Brazil
a
more
expensive
international
destination.290

This
trend
changed
in
2009,
when
both
visitors
and
revenues
fell
as
a
result
of
the
Great
Recession
of
2008–09.291
By
2010,
the
industry
had
recovered,
and
arrivals
grew
above
2006
levels
to
5.2million
international

and
receipts
from
these
visitors
reached
US$6billion.281
In
2011
the
historical

was
reached
with
5.4million

Despite
continuing
record-breaking
international
tourism
revenues,
the
number
of
Brazilian
tourists
travelling
overseas
has
been
growing
steadily
since
2003,
resulting
in
a
net
negative
foreign
exchange
balance,
as
more
money
is
spent
abroad
by
Brazilians
than
comes
in
as
receipts
from
international
tourists
visiting
Brazil.292
Tourism
expenditures
abroad
grew
from
US$5.8billion
in
2006,
to
US$8.2billion
in
2007,
a
42%
increase,
representing
a
net
deficit
of
US$3.3billion
in
2007,
as
compared
to
US$1.5billion
in
2006,
a
125%
increase
from
the
previous
year.292
This
trend
is
caused
by
Brazilians
taking
advantage
of
the
stronger
Real
to
travel
and
making
relatively
cheaper
expenditures
abroad.292
Brazilians
traveling
overseas
in
2006
represented
4%
of
the
country's
population.293
In
2005,
tourism
contributed
with
3.2%
of
the
country's
revenues
from
exports
of
goods
and
services,
and
represented
7%
of
direct
and

employment
in
the
Brazilian
economy.294
In
2006
direct
employment
in
the
sector
reached
1.9million

Domestic
tourism
is
a
fundamental
market
segment
for
the
industry,
as
51
million
people
traveled
throughout
the
country
in

Brazilian
roads
are
the
primary
carriers
of
freight
and
passenger
traffic.
The
road
system
totaled
1.98million
km
(1.23million
mi)
in
2002.
The
total
of
paved
roads
increased
from
35,496km
(22,056mi)
(22,056mi)
in
1967
to
184,140km
(114,419mi)
(114,425mi)
in

The
first
investments
in
road
infrastructure
have
given
up
in
the
1920s,
the
government
of
Washington
Luis,
being
pursued
in
the
governments
of
Getúlio
Vargas
and
Eurico
Gaspar
Dutra.322
President
Juscelino
Kubitschek
(1956–61),
who
designed
and
built
the
capital
Brasília,
was
another
supporter
of
highways.
Kubitschek
was
responsible
for
the
installation
of
major
car
manufacturers
in
the
country
(Volkswagen,
Ford
and
General
Motors
arrived
in
Brazil
during
his
rule)
and
one
of
the
points
used
to
attract
them
was
support
for
the
construction
of
highways.
With
the
implementation
of
Fiat
in
1976
ending
an
automobile
market
closed
loop,
from
the
end
of
the
1990s
the
country
has
received
large
foreign
direct
investments
installing
in
its
territory
other
major
car
manufacturers
and
utilities,
such
as
Iveco,
Renault,
Peugeot,
Citroen,
Honda,
Mitsubishi,
Mercedes-Benz,
BMW,
Hyundai,
Toyota
among
others.323
Brazil
is
the
seventh
most
important
country
in
the
auto
industry.324
Brazil's
railway
system
has
been
declining
since
1945,
when
emphasis
shifted
to
highway
construction.
The
total
length
of
railway
track
was
30,875km
(19,185mi)
in
2002,
as
compared
with
31,848km
(19,789mi)
in
1970.
Most
of
the
railway
system
belonged
to
the
Federal
Railroad
Corporation
RFFSA,
which
was
privatized
in
2007.325
The
São
Paulo
Metro
was
the
first
underground
transit
system
in
Brazil.
The
other
metro
systems
are
in
Rio
de
Janeiro,
Porto
Alegre,
Recife,
Belo
Horizonte,
Brasília,
Teresina
and
Fortaleza.
The
country
has
an
extensive
rail
network
of
28,538
kilometres
(17,733
miles)
in
length,
the
tenth
largest
network
in
the
world.326
Currently,
the
Brazilian
government,
unlike
the
past,
seeks
to
encourage
this
mode
of
transport;
an
example
of
this
incentive
is
the
project
of
the
Rio–São
Paulo
high-speed
rail,
that
will
connect
the
two
main
cities
of
the
country
to
carry
passengers.
There
are
about
2,500
airports
in
Brazil,
including
landing
fields:
the
second
largest
number
in
the
world,
after
the
United
States.327
São
Paulo–Guarulhos
International
Airport,
near
São
Paulo,
is
the
largest
and
busiest
airport
with
nearly
20
million
passengers
annually,
while
handling
the
vast
majority
of
commercial
traffic
for
the
country.328
For
freight
transport
waterways
are
of
importance,
e.g.
the
industrial
zones
of
Manaus
can
be
reached
only
by
means
of
the
Solimões–Amazonas
waterway
(3,250
kilometres
(2,020
miles)
with
6
metres
(20
feet)
minimum
depth).
The
country
also
has
50,000
kilometres
(31,000
miles)
of
waterways.326

the

(SUS),
is
managed
and
provided
by
all
levels
of

being
the
largest
system
of
this

On
the
other
hand,
private
healthcare
systems
play
a
complementary
role.334
Public
health
services
are
universal
and
offered
to
all
citizens
of
the
country
for
free.
However,
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
health
centers
and
hospitals
are
financed
by
taxes,
and
the
country
spends
about
9%
of
its
GDP
on
expenditures
in
the
area.
In
2012,
Brazil
had
1.85
doctors
and
2.3
hospital
beds
for
every
1,000
inhabitants.335336
Despite
all
the
progress
made
since
the
creation
of
the
universal
health
care
system
in
1988,
there
are
still
several
public
health
problems
in
Brazil.
In
2006,
the
main
points
to
be
solved
were
the
high
infant
(2.51%)
and
maternal
mortality
rates
(73.1
deaths
per
1000
births).337
The
number
of
deaths
from
noncommunicable
diseases,
such
as
cardiovascular
diseases
(151.7
deaths
per
100,000
inhabitants)
and
cancer
(72.7
deaths
per
100,000
inhabitants),
also
has
a
considerable
impact
on
the
health
of
the
Brazilian
population.
Finally,
external
but
preventable
factors
such
as
car
accidents,
violence
and
suicide
caused
14.9%
of
all
deaths
in
the
country.337
The
Brazilian
health
system
was

125th
among

The

determine
that
the
Union,
the
states,
the

and
the
municipalities
must
manage
and
organize
their
respective
education
systems.
Each
of
these
public
educational
systems
is
responsible
for
its
own
maintenance,
which
manages
funds
as
well
as

The
constitution
reserves
25%
of
the
state
budget
and
18%
of

and

taxes
for
education.339
According
to
the
IBGE,
in
2011,
the
literacy
rate
of
the
population
was
90.4%,
meaning
that
13
million
(9.6%
of
population)
people
are
still
illiterate
in
the
country;
functional
illiteracy
has
reached
21.6%
of
the
population.340
Illiteracy
is
highest
in
the
Northeast,
where
19.9%
of
the
population
is
illiterate.341
Higher
education
starts
with
undergraduate
or
sequential
courses,
which
may
offer
different
options
of
specialization
in
academic
or
professional
careers.
Depending
on
the
choice,
students
can
improve
their
educational
background
with
courses
of
post-graduate
studies
or
broad
sense.
Attending
an
institution
of
higher
education
is
required
by
Law
of
Guidelines
and
Bases
of
Education.
Kindergarten,
elementary
and
medium
education
are
required
of
all
students,
provided
the
student
does
not
hold
any
disability,
whether
physical,
mental,
visual
or

The
University
of
São
Paulo
is
the
second
best
university
in
Latin
America,
according
to
recent
2019
QS
World
University
Rankings.
Of
the
top
20
Latin
American
universities,
eight
are
Brazilian.
Most
of
them
are
public.342
Brazil's
private
institutions
tend
to
be
more
exclusive
and
offer
better
quality
education,
so
many
high-income
families
send
their
children
there.
The
result
is
a
segregated
educational
system
that
reflects
extreme
income
disparities
and
reinforces
social
inequality.
However,
efforts
to
change
this
are
making

Religion
in
Brazil
was
formed
from
the
meeting
of
the
Catholic
Church
with
the
religious
traditions
of
enslaved
African
peoples
and
indigenous
peoples.397.
This
confluence
of
faiths
during
the
Portuguese
colonization
of
Brazil
led
to
the
development
of
a
diverse
array
of
syncretistic
practices
within
the
overarching
umbrella
of
Brazilian
Catholic
Church,
characterized
by
traditional
Portuguese
festivities,398
and
in
some
instances,
Allan
Kardec's
Spiritism
(a
religion
which
incorporates
elements
of
spiritualism
and
Christianity).
Religious
pluralism
increased
during
the
20th
century,399
and
the
Protestant
community
has
grown
to
include
over
22%
of
the
population.400
The
most
common
Protestant
denominations
are
Evangelical
Pentecostal
ones.
Other
Protestant
branches
with
a
notable
presence
in
the
country
include
the
Baptists,
Seventh-day
Adventists,
Lutherans
and
the
Reformed
tradition.401
However,
in
the
last
ten
years
Protestantism,
particularly
in
forms
of
Pentecostalism
and
Evangelicalism,
has
spread
in
Brazil,
while
the
proportion
of
Catholics
has
dropped
significantly.402
After
Protestantism,
individuals
professing
no
religion
are
also
a
significant
group,
exceeding
8%
of
the
population
as
of
the
2010

an

The
official
language
of
Brazil
is
Portuguese416
(Article
13
of
the
Constitution
of
the
Federal
Republic
of
Brazil),
which
almost
all
of
the
population
speaks
and
is
virtually
the
only
language
used
in
newspapers,
radio,
television,
and
for
business
and
administrative
purposes.
Brazil
is
the
only
Portuguese-speaking
nation
in
the
Americas,
making
the
language
an
important
part
of
Brazilian
national
identity
and
giving
it
a
national
culture
distinct
from
those
of
its
Spanish-speaking
neighbors.417
Brazilian
Portuguese
has
had
its
own
development,
mostly
similar
to
16th-century
Central
and
Southern
dialects
of
European
Portuguese418
(despite
a
very
substantial
number
of
Portuguese
colonial
settlers,
and
more
recent
immigrants,
coming
from
Northern
regions,
and
in
minor
degree
Portuguese
Macaronesia),
with
a
few
influences
from
the
Amerindian
and
African
languages,
especially
West
African
and
Bantu
restricted
to
the
vocabulary
only.419
As
a
result,citation
needed
the
language
is
somewhat
different,
mostly
in
phonology,
from
the
language
of
Portugal
and
other
Portuguese-speaking
countries
(the
dialects
of
the
other
countries,
partly
because
of
the
more
recent
end
of
Portuguese
colonialism
in
these
regions,
have
a
closer
connection
to
contemporary
European
Portuguese).
These
differences
are
comparable
to
those
between
American
and
British
English.419
In
1990,
the
Community
of
Portuguese
Language
Countries
(CPLP),
which
included
representatives
from
all
countries
with
Portuguese
as
the
official
language,
reached
an
agreement
on
the
reform
of
the
Portuguese
orthography
to
unify
the
two
standards
then
in
use
by
Brazil
on
one
side
and
the
remaining
lusophone
countries
on
the
other.
This
spelling
reform
went
into
effect
in
Brazil
on
1
January
2009.
In
Portugal,
the
reform
was
signed
into
law
by
the
President
on
21
July
2008
allowing
for
a
six-year
adaptation
period,
during
which
both
orthographies
will
co-exist.
The
remaining
CPLP
countries
are
free
to
establish
their
own
transition
timetables.420

The
core
culture
of
Brazil
is
derived
from
Portuguese
culture,
because
of
its
strong
colonial
ties
with
the
Portuguese
Empire.431
Among
other
influences,
the
Portuguese
introduced
the
Portuguese
language,
Roman
Catholicism
and
colonial
architectural
styles.
The
culture
was,
however,
also
strongly
influenced
by
African,
indigenous
and
non-Portuguese
European
cultures
and
traditions.432
Some
aspects
of
Brazilian
culture
were
influenced
by
the
contributions
of
Italian,
German
and
other
European
as
well
as
Japanese,
Jewish
and
Arab
immigrants
who
arrived
in
large
numbers
in
the
South
and
Southeast
of
Brazil
during
the
19th
and
20th
centuries.433
The
indigenous
Amerindians
influenced
Brazil's
language
and
cuisine;
and
the
Africans
influenced
language,
cuisine,
music,
dance
and
religion.434
Brazilian
art
has
developed
since
the
16th
century
into
different
styles
that
range
from
Baroque
(the
dominant
style
in
Brazil
until
the
early
19th
century)435436
to
Romanticism,
Modernism,
Expressionism,
Cubism,

dates
back
to

architecture
of
later
centuries.439
In
the
19th
century
during
the
time
of
the
Empire
of
Brazil,
Brazil
followed
European
trends
and
adopted
Neoclassical
and
Gothic
Revival
architecture.
Then
in
the
20th
century
especially
in
Brasilia,
Brazil
experimented
with
Modernist
architecture.
The
colonial
architecture
of
Brazil
dates
to
the
early
16th
century
when
Brazil
was
first
explored,
conquered
and
settled
by
the
Portuguese.
The
Portuguese
built
architecture
familiar
to
them
in
Europe
in
their
aim
to
colonize
Brazil.
They
built
Portuguese
colonial
architecture
which
included
churches,
civic
architecture
including
houses
and
forts
in
Brazilian
cities
and
the
countryside.
During
19th
century
Brazilian
architecture
saw
the
introduction
of
more
European
styles
to
Brazil
such
as
Neoclassical
and
Gothic
Revival
architecture.
This
was
usually
mixed
with
Brazilian
influences
from
their
own
heritage
which
produced
a
unique
form
of
Brazilian
architecture.
In
the
1950s
the
modernist
architecture
was
introduced
when
Brasilia
was
built
as
new
federal
capital
in
the
interior
of
Brazil
to
help
develop
the
interior.
The
architect
Oscar
Niemeyer
idealized
and
built
government
buildings,
churches
and
civic
buildings
in
the
modernist
style.440441

The
music
of
Brazil
was
formed
mainly
from
the
fusion
of
European
and
African
elements.443
Until
the
nineteenth
century,
Portugal
was
the
gateway
to
most
of
the
influences
that
built
Brazilian
music,
although
many
of
these
elements
were
not
of
Portuguese
origin,
but
generally
European.
The
first
was
José
Maurício
Nunes
Garcia,
author
of
sacred
pieces
with
influence
of
Viennese
classicism.444
The
major
contribution
of
the
African
element
was
the
rhythmic
diversity
and
some
dances
and
instruments
that
had
a
bigger
role
in
the
development
of
popular
music
and
folk,
flourishing
especially
in
the
twentieth
century.443
Popular
music
since
the
late
eighteenth
century
began
to
show
signs
of
forming
a
characteristically
Brazilian
sound,
with
samba
considered
the
most
typical
and
on
the
UNESCO
cultural
heritage
list.445
Maracatu
and
Afoxê
are
two
Afro-Brazilian
music
traditions
that
have
been
popularized
by
their
appearance
in
the
annual
Brazilian
Carnivals.446
The
sport
of
capoeira
is
usually
played
with
its
own
music
referred
to
as
capoeira
music,
which
is
usually
considered
to
be
a
call-and-response
type
of
folk
music.447
Forró
is
a
type
of
folk
music
prominent
during
the
Festa
Junina
in
northeastern
Brazil.448
Jack
A.
Draper
III,
a
professor
of
Portuguese
at
the
University
of
Missouri,449
argues
that
Forró
was
used
as
a
way
to
subdue
feelings
of
nostalgia
for
a
rural
lifestyle.450
Choro
is
a
very
popular
music
instrumental
style.
Its
origins
are
in
19th-century
Rio
de
Janeiro.
In
spite
of
the
name,
the
style
often
has
a
fast
and
happy
rhythm,
characterized
by
virtuosity,
improvisation,
subtle
modulations
and
full
of
syncopation
and
counterpoint.451
Bossa
nova
is
also
a
well-known
style
of
Brazilian
music
developed
and
popularized
in
the
1950s
and
1960s.452
The
phrase
"bossa
nova"
means
literally
"new
trend".453
A
lyrical
fusion
of
samba
and
jazz,
bossa

acquired
a
large
following
starting
in

was
used
for
the
dissemination
of

doctrine
in

in

and
18th
centuries
the
first
dramatists
who
appeared
on
the
scene
of
European
derivation
was
for
court
or
private
performances.477
During
the
19th
century,
dramatic
theater
gained
importance
and
thickness,
whose
first
representative
was
Luis
Carlos
Martins
Pena
(1813–1848),
capable
of
describing
contemporary
reality.
Always
in
this
period
the
comedy
of
costume
and
comic
production
was
imposed.
Significant,
also
in
the
nineteenth
century,
was
also
the
playwright
Antônio
Gonçalves
Dias.478
There
were
also
numerous
operas
and
orchestras.
The
Brazilian
conductor
Antônio
Carlos
Gomes
became
internationally
known
with
operas
like
Il
Guarany.
At
the
end
of
the
19th
century
orchestrated
dramaturgias
became
very
popular
and
were
accompanied
with
songs
of
famous
artists
like
the

there
was
the

but
paradoxically
the
quality
of
the
products
staggered,
and
only
in
1940
the
Brazilian
theater
received
a
boost
of
renewal
thanks
to
the
action
of

Nheengatú
(also

língua
geral

or
lingua
Brasilica)
originated
in
the
17th
century
in
what
are
now
the
states
of
Pará
Maranhão,
as
lingua
franca
on
the
basis
of
Tupinambá
lexicon
but
with
strong
grammatical
influence
from
Portuguese,
also
due
to
intervention
by
Jesuit
missionaries
[...]
Around
1700
it
was
spoken
in
a
large
area
in
Brazil,
as
a
contact
language
between
whites
and
indians,
but
it
lost
some
support
with
the
expulsion
of
the
Jesuits
in
1758
[...]
Its
sister
language
in
the
colonial
period
was
Língua
Geral
Paulista
(in
the
state
of
São
Paolo)
a
lingua
franca
which
is
now
extinct.
