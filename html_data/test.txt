Or because the term long is relative, perhaps I should say \r\nthe best longer or longish poems. I have not \r\nincluded poems of epic length like Beowulf, Pearl, Sir Gawain and \r\nthe Green Knight, Geoffrey Chaucer\'s Canterbury Tales, Edmund \r\nSpenser\'s The Faerie Queene, Shakespeare\'s blank verse plays such as \r\nHamlet and Macbeth, John Milton\'s\r\nParadise Lost and Paradise \r\nRegained, John Keats\' Endymion, William Carlos Williams\'\r\nPaterson, Ezra \r\nPound\'s Cantos, Walt Whitman\'s Leaves of Grass, or translations of Dante\'s Inferno, Virgil\'s \r\nAeneid, and \r\nHomer\'s Odyssey and Iliad. Instead, I have chosen to focus on longer \r\npoems that can easily be read in a single sitting. But epigrams, limericks and sonnets need \r\nnot apply! \r\n\r\nOn a somber note, we have a new page of poems from around the globe:\r\nPoems for the Victims and Survivors of the \r\nCoronavirus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Young Girl Reading by Jean-Honor\xe9 Fragonard, 1776\r\n\r\nOne of the poems on this page, The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes, has a \r\nstunningly good, professionally-acted BBC video starring Richard Armitrage as Guy \r\nof Gisborne and Lucy Griffiths as Marian of Knighton. The poem is sung quite \r\nwonderfully by Loreena McKennitt in the background. The full text of the poem appears below the video.\r\nAnother poem high in my rankings, Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song, has been called \r\nthe best anonymous poem in the English language by one of the major  \r\nliterary critics of our day, Harold Bloom. In fact, Bloom said that he\'s inclined \r\nto attribute the poem to William Shakespeare, simply due to its excellence! \r\nThese are two poems that I highly recommend, but really all the poems in my Top \r\nTen are must reads.\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this page reflects one person\'s opinion, for whatever that\'s worth ...\r\n\r\nThe Top Ten Long, Longer or Longish Poems\r\n\r\n(10) Daddy and Tulips by Sylvia Plath (two remarkable poems by the golden-haired rock star of American poetry)\r\nAfter the Persian by Louis Bogan (a lovely lament written by a great but undervalued poet)\r\nPrometheus Unbound by Percy Bysshe Shelley (the first call to \r\nnonviolent resistance by a major artist)\r\nFern Hill by Dylan Thomas (a glorious romp through remembrances of childhood)\r\nDon Juan by George Gordon, Lord Byron (a delightfully cynical, satirical \r\nassay of the sorrows and absurdities of life)\r\n(9) The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes (a lovely melodic ghost story that will delight adults \r\nand children alike)\r\n(8) In Memory of W. B. Yeats by W. H. Auden (one of the best elegies in the English language, in a modern style)\r\n(7) The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot (with this eclectic poem Eliot may have created our vision of the modern poet: himself!)\r\n(6) Sunday Morning by Wallace Stevens (a master of English meter tackles vexing but ultimately unanswerable questions of life and faith)\r\n(5) Voyages by Hart Crane is surely the greatest rhapsodic love poem \r\nin the English language!\r\n(4) Tom O\' Bedlam\'s Song by Anonymous (the amazing final stanza is like \r\nDon Quixote condensed to a few electric lines)\r\n(3) Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood by William Wordsworth (perhaps the greatest spiritual poem in the \r\nEnglish language)\r\n(2) Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard by Thomas Gray may have \r\nbeen \r\nthe first great poem of English Romanticism\r\n(1) Song of Myself, Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking and When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\'d by Walt Whitman (the inventor of modern free verse)\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: Let America Be America Again by Langston Hughes, \r\nHowl by Allen Ginsberg, Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold, Four Quartets \r\nand The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, Directive by Robert Frost, The Fish by Elizabeth Bishop, The \r\nRaven by Edgar Allan Poe, Memorial Rain by Archibald MacLeish, Church Going \r\nby Philip Larkin, Ulysses \r\nand In Memoriam A.H.H. by Lord Alfred Tennyson, The Song of Hiawatha and Evangeline by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \r\nHis Confession by the Archpoet, The Song of Solomon from the King \r\nJames Bible (aka The Song of Songs), Piers Plowman by William Langland, \r\nBrut by Layamon, Adonais, Queen Mab and The Revolt of Islam by Percy Bysshe \r\nShelley, Omeros by Derek Walcott, The Prelude and \r\nTintern Abbey by William Wordsworth, Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge by \r\nHart Crane, Venus and Adonis and The Phoenix and \r\nthe Turtle by William Shakespeare, The Rape of the Lock by Alexander \r\nPope\r\n\r\nIf Leaves of Grass is considered to be one long poem, \r\nthen in my opinion it should be considered along with the great epic poems of \r\nHomer, Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton. However, it is my \r\nunderstanding that Whitman agreed with his contemporary Edgar Allan Poe that \r\nlong poems are not compatible with the English language (or perhaps not with \r\nmodern readers of English poetry). I believe most readers today \r\nprefer poems they can read in a single sitting, and all the poems above and \r\nbelow fall into that category. \r\n\r\nIn 1995 the BBC conducted a poll, asking listeners and viewers to name their \r\nfavorite poems. A number of long/longish poems were among England\'s favorites, \r\nincluding The Lady of Shallot by Alfred Lord Tennyson, Rime of the Ancient \r\nMariner and Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Prelude by \r\nWilliam Wordsworth, Preludes by T. S. Eliot, The Whitsun Weddings by Philip \r\nLarkin, and several of the poems previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaddy\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nYou do not do, you do not do\r\nAny more, black shoe\r\nIn which I have lived like a foot\r\nFor thirty years, poor and white,\r\nBarely daring to breathe or Achoo.\r\n\r\nDaddy, I have had to kill you.\r\nYou died before I had time\r\nMarble-heavy, a bag full of God,\r\nGhastly statue with one gray toe\r\nBig as a Frisco seal\r\n\r\nAnd a head in the freakish Atlantic\r\nWhere it pours bean green over blue\r\nIn the waters off the beautiful Nauset.\r\nI used to pray to recover you.\r\nAch, du.\r\n\r\nIn the German tongue, in the Polish town\r\nScraped flat by the roller\r\nOf wars, wars, wars.\r\nBut the name of the town is common.\r\nMy Polack friend\r\n\r\nSays there are a dozen or two.\r\nSo I never could tell where you\r\nPut your foot, your root, \r\nI never could talk to you.\r\nThe tongue stuck in my jaw.\r\n\r\nIt stuck in a barb wire snare.\r\nIch, ich, ich, ich,\r\nI could hardly speak.\r\nI thought every German was you.\r\nAnd the language obscene\r\n\r\nAn engine, an engine, \r\nChuffing me off like a Jew.\r\nA Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.\r\nI began to talk like a Jew.\r\nI think I may well be a Jew.\r\n\r\nThe snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna \r\nAre not very pure or true.\r\nWith my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck\r\nAnd my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack\r\nI may be a bit of a Jew.\r\n\r\nI have always been scared of you,\r\nWith your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.\r\nAnd your neat mustache\r\nAnd your Aryan eye, bright blue.\r\nPanzer-man, panzer-man, O You\r\n\r\nNot God but a swastika\r\nSo black no sky could squeak through.\r\nEvery woman adores a Fascist,\r\nThe boot in the face, the brute\r\nBrute heart of a brute like you.\r\n\r\nYou stand at the blackboard, daddy,\r\nIn the picture I have of you,\r\nA cleft in your chin instead of your foot\r\nBut no less a devil for that, no not\r\nAny less the black man who\r\n\r\nBit my pretty red heart in two.\r\nI was ten when they buried you.\r\nAt twenty I tried to die\r\nAnd get back, back, back to you.\r\nI thought even the bones would do.\r\n\r\nBut they pulled me out of the sack,\r\nAnd they stuck me together with glue.\r\nAnd then I knew what to do.\r\nI made a model of you,\r\nA man in black with a Meinkampf look\r\n\r\nAnd a love of the rack and the screw.\r\nAnd I said I do, I do.\r\nSo daddy, I\'m finally through.\r\nThe black telephone\'s off at the root,\r\nThe voices just can\'t worm through.\r\n\r\nIf I\'ve killed one man, I\'ve killed two\r\nThe vampire who said he was you\r\nAnd drank my blood for a year,\r\nSeven years, if you want to know.\r\nDaddy, you can lie back now.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a stake in your fat black heart\r\nAnd the villagers never liked you.\r\nThey are dancing and stamping on you.\r\nThey always knew it was you.\r\nDaddy, daddy, you bastard, I\'m through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Memory of W. B. Yeats\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in the dead of winter:\r\nThe brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,\r\nAnd snow disfigured the public statues;\r\nThe mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nFar from his illness\r\nThe wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,\r\nThe peasant river was untempted by the fashionable \r\nquays;\r\nBy mourning tongues\r\nThe death of the poet was kept from his poems.\r\n\r\nBut for him it was his last afternoon as himself,\r\nAn afternoon of nurses and rumours;\r\nThe provinces of his body revolted,\r\nThe squares of his mind were empty,\r\nSilence invaded the suburbs,\r\nThe current of his feeling failed; he became his \r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nNow he is scattered among a hundred cities\r\nAnd wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,\r\nTo find his happiness in another kind of wood\r\nAnd be punished under a foreign code of conscience.\r\nThe words of a dead man\r\nAre modified in the guts of the living.\r\n\r\nBut in the importance and noise of to-morrow\r\nWhen the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of \r\nthe Bourse,\r\nAnd the poor have the sufferings to which they are \r\nfairly accustomed,\r\nAnd each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of \r\nhis freedom,\r\nA few thousand will think of this day\r\nAs one thinks of a day when one did something slightly \r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nYou were silly like us; your gift survived it all:\r\nThe parish of rich women, physical decay,\r\nYourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.\r\nNow Ireland has her madness and her weather still,\r\nFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives\r\nIn the valley of its making where executives\r\nWould never want to tamper, flows on south\r\nFrom ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,\r\nRaw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,\r\nA way of happening, a mouth.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEarth, receive an honoured guest:\r\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest.\r\nLet the Irish vessel lie\r\nEmptied of its poetry.\r\n\r\nIn the nightmare of the dark\r\nAll the dogs of Europe bark,\r\nAnd the living nations wait,\r\nEach sequestered in its hate;\r\n\r\nIntellectual disgrace\r\nStares from every human face,\r\nAnd the seas of pity lie\r\nLocked and frozen in each eye.\r\n\r\nFollow, poet, follow right\r\nTo the bottom of the night,\r\nWith your unconstraining voice\r\nStill persuade us to rejoice;\r\n\r\nWith the farming of a verse\r\nMake a vineyard of the curse,\r\nSing of human unsuccess\r\nIn a rapture of distress;\r\n\r\nIn the deserts of the heart\r\nLet the healing fountain start,\r\nIn the prison of his days\r\nTeach the free man how to praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProem:\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge by Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song \r\nanonymous ballad, circa 1620\r\n\r\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\r\nThat into rags would rend ye,\r\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\r\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\r\nThat of your five sound senses\r\nYou never be forsaken,\r\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\r\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nOf thirty bare years have I\r\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\r\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\r\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\r\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\r\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\r\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\r\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\r\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\r\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\r\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\r\nI befell into this dotage.\r\nI slept not since the Conquest,\r\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\r\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\r\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\r\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\r\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\r\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\r\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\r\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\r\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\r\nMe music to my sorrow.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\r\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\r\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\r\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\r\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\r\nI sup, and when benighted,\r\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\r\nYet never am affrighted.\r\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nI know more than Apollo,\r\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\r\nI see the stars at mortal wars\r\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\r\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\r\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\r\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\r\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\r\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\r\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\r\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\r\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\r\nMe handle not nor spare not;\r\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\r\nDo what the panther dare not.\r\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith an host of furious fancies,\r\nWhereof I am commander,\r\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\r\nTo the wilderness I wander.\r\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\r\nI summoned am to tourney\r\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\r\nMethinks it is no journey.\r\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Persian\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI do not wish to know\r\nThe depths of your terrible jungle:\r\nFrom what nest your leopard leaps\r\nOr what sterile lianas are at once your serpents\' disguise\r\n and home.\r\n\r\nI am the dweller on the temperate threshold,\r\nThe strip of corn and vine,\r\nWhere all is translucence (the light!)\r\nLiquidity, and the sound of water.\r\nHere the days pass under shade\r\nAnd the nights have the waxing and the waning moon.\r\nHere the moths take flight at evening;\r\nHere at morning the dove whistles and the pigeons coo.\r\nHere, as night comes on, the fireflies wink and snap\r\nClose to the cool ground,\r\nShining in a profusion\r\nCelestial or marine.\r\n\r\nHere it is never wholly dark but always wholly green,\r\nAnd the day stains with what seems to be more than the\r\n sun\r\nWhat may be more than my flesh.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI have wept with the spring storm;\r\nBurned with the brutal summer.\r\nNow, hearing the wind and the twanging bow-strings,\r\nI know what winter brings.\r\n\r\nThe hunt sweeps out upon the plain\r\nAnd the garden darkens.\r\nThey will bring the trophies home\r\nTo bleed and perish\r\nBeside the trellis and the lattices,\r\nBeside the fountain, still flinging diamond water,\r\nBeside the pool\r\n(Which is eight-sided, like my heart).\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAll has been translated into treasure: \r\n\r\nWeightless as amber,\r\nTranslucent as the currant on the branch,\r\nDark as the rose\'s thorn.\r\n\r\nWhere is the shimmer of evil?\r\nThis is the shell\'s iridescence\r\nAnd the wild bird\'s wing.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIgnorant, I took up my burden in the wilderness.\r\nWise with great wisdom, I shall lay it down upon \r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGoodbye, goodbye!\r\nThere was so much to love, I could not love it all;\r\nI could not love it enough.\r\n\r\nSome things I overlooked, and some I could not find.\r\nLet the crystal clasp them\r\nWhen you drink your wine, in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\r\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\r\n\r\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\'s shade,\r\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,\r\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\r\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\r\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\r\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\r\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\r\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\r\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share,\r\n\r\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\r\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\r\nHow bow\'d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\r\n\r\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\r\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\r\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\r\nThe short and simple annals of the Poor.\r\n\r\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\r\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\r\nAwaits alike th\' inevitable hour:\r\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\r\n\r\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault\r\nIf Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise,\r\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\r\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\r\n\r\nCan storied urn or animated bust\r\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\nCan Honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\nOr Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\r\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\r\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\'d,\r\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\r\n\r\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\r\nRich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\r\nChill Penury repress\'d their noble rage,\r\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\r\n\r\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene\r\nThe dark unfathom\'d caves of ocean bear:\r\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\r\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,\r\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\r\nSome Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\r\n\r\nTh\' applause of list\'ning senates to command,\r\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\r\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\r\nAnd read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\r\n\r\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone\r\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\r\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\r\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\r\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\r\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\r\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\r\n\r\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\r\nTheir sober wishes never learn\'d to stray;\r\nAlong the cool sequester\'d vale of life\r\nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.\r\n\r\nYet e\'en these bones from insult to protect\r\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\r\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck\'d,\r\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\r\n\r\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th\' unletter\'d Muse,\r\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\r\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\r\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\r\n\r\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\r\nThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resign\'d,\r\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\r\nNor cast one longing lingering look behind?\r\n\r\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\r\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\r\nE\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\r\n\r\nFor thee, who, mindful of th\' unhonour\'d dead,\r\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\r\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\r\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\r\n\r\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\r\nOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\r\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,\r\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn;\r\n\r\n\'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\r\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.\r\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\r\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\r\n\r\n\'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\r\nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;\r\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\r\nOr crazed with care, or cross\'d in hopeless love.\r\n\r\n\'One morn I miss\'d him on the custom\'d hill,\r\nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;\r\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\r\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\r\n\r\n\'The next with dirges due in sad array\r\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\r\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\r\nGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\'\r\n\r\nThe Epitaph\r\n\r\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\r\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\r\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\r\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own.\r\n\r\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\r\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\r\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\r\nHe gained from Heaven (\'twas all he wish\'d) a friend.\r\n\r\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\r\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode\r\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\r\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDylan Thomas (1914-1953) despite being born in South Wales was the \r\narchetypal Romantic poet of the popular American imaginationhe was flamboyantly \r\ntheatrical, a heavy drinker, engaged in roaring disputes in public, and read his \r\nwork aloud with tremendous depth of feeling and a singing Welsh lilt.\r\n\r\nFern Hill\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nNow as I was young and easy under the apple boughs\r\nAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,\r\n The night above the dingle starry,\r\n Time let me hail and \r\nclimb\r\n Golden in the heydays of his eyes,\r\nAnd honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns\r\nAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves\r\n Trail with daisies and \r\nbarley\r\n Down the rivers of the windfall light.\r\n\r\nAnd as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns\r\nAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,\r\n In the sun that is young once only,\r\n Time let me play and be\r\n\r\n Golden in the mercy of his means,\r\nAnd green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves\r\nSang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,\r\n And the sabbath rang \r\nslowly\r\n In the pebbles of the holy streams.\r\n\r\nAll the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay\r\nFields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air\r\n And playing, lovely and watery\r\n And fire green as grass.\r\n And nightly under the simple stars\r\nAs I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,\r\nAll the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars\r\n Flying with the ricks, and the horses\r\n Flashing into the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white\r\nWith the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all\r\n Shining, it was Adam and maiden,\r\n The sky gathered again\r\n And the sun grew round that very day.\r\nSo it must have been after the birth of the simple light\r\nIn the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm\r\n Out of the whinnying green stable\r\n On to the fields of \r\npraise.\r\n\r\nAnd honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house\r\nUnder the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,\r\n In the sun born over and over,\r\n I ran my heedless ways,\r\n My wishes raced through the house high hay\r\nAnd nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows\r\nIn all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs\r\n Before the children green and golden\r\n Follow him out of grace,\r\n\r\nNothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me\r\nUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,\r\n In the moon that is always rising,\r\n Nor that riding to sleep\r\n I should hear him fly with the high fields\r\nAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.\r\nOh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,\r\n Time held me green and \r\ndying\r\n Though I sang in my chains like the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highwayman \r\nby Alfred Noyes\r\n\r\nThis excellent BBC enactment of The Highwayman runs 9 1/2 minutes and features

His face burnt like a brand\r\n\r\nAs the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; \r\nAnd he kissed its waves in the moonlight, \r\n           (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!) \r\nThen he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the \r\nWest. \r\n\t\r\nHe did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon; \r\nAnd out o\' the tawny sunset, before the rise o\' the moon, \r\nWhen the road was a gypsy\'s ribbon, looping the purple moor, \r\nA red-coat troop came marching\r\n           Marchingmarching\r\nKing George\'s men came matching, up to the old inn-door. \r\n\t\r\nThey said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, \r\nBut they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow \r\nbed; \r\nTwo of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! \r\nThere was death at every window; \r\n           And hell at one dark window; \r\nFor Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would \r\nride. \r\n\t\r\nThey had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest; \r\nThey had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!\r\n\r\nNow, keep good watch! and they kissed her. \r\n           She heard the dead man say\r\nLook for me by moonlight; \r\n           Watch for me by moonlight; \r\nI\'ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!\r\n\r\n\t\r\nShe twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! \r\nShe writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! \r\nThey stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by \r\nlike years, \r\nTill, now, on the stroke of midnight, \r\n           Cold, on the stroke of midnight, \r\nThe tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! \r\n\t\r\nThe tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!\r\n\r\nUp, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast, \r\nShe would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; \r\nFor the road lay bare in the moonlight; \r\n           Blank and bare in the moonlight; \r\nAnd the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love\'s \r\nrefrain . \r\n\t\r\n Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs \r\nringing clear; \r\nTlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they \r\ndid not hear? \r\nDown the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, \r\nThe highwayman came riding, \r\n           Riding, riding! \r\nThe red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the \r\nechoing night! \r\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! \r\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, \r\nThen her finger moved in the moonlight, \r\n           Her musket shattered the moonlight, \r\nShattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death. \r\n\t\r\nHe turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood \r\nBowed, with her head o\'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!\r\n\r\nNot till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear \r\nHow Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \r\n           The landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \r\nHad watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness \r\nthere. \r\n\t\r\nBack, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, \r\nWith the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\r\n\r\nBlood-red were his spurs i\' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet \r\ncoat, \r\nWhen they shot him down on the highway, \r\n           Down like a dog on the highway, \r\nAnd he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his \r\nthroat. \r\n\t\r\n And still of a winter\'s night, they say, when the wind is in the \r\ntrees, \r\nWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, \r\nWhen the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, \r\nA highwayman comes riding\r\n           Ridingriding\r\nA highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.\r\n\r\n Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard; \r\nHe taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred; \r\nHe whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there \r\nBut the landlord\'s black-eyed daughter, \r\n           Bess, the landlord\'s daughter, \r\nPlaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote the following poem after falling in love with The Highwayman, then \r\nlearning that I had been born the same year that Alfred Noyes died. I have long \r\nfelt a kinship with him. My poem was written after I learned that the editors of \r\nmajor literary journals were discriminating against poems like The Highwayman \r\nbecause they consider meter and rhyme to be pass\xe9. That makes absolutely no \r\nsense to me, because nearly all hit songs are rhyming poems set to music!\r\n\r\n\r\nPoetry\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPoetry, I found you\r\nwhere at last they chained and bound you;\r\nwith devices all around you\r\nto torture and confound you,\r\nI found youshivering, bare.\r\n\r\nThey had shorn your raven hair\r\nand taken both your eyes\r\nwhich, once cerulean as Gogh\'s skies,\r\nhad leapt with dawn to wild surmise\r\nof what was waiting there.\r\n\r\nYour back was bent with untold care;\r\nthere savage whips had left cruel scars\r\nas though the wounds of countless wars;\r\nyour bones were broken with the force\r\nwith which they\'d lashed your flesh so fair.\r\n\r\nYou once were loveliest of all.\r\nSo many nights you held in thrall\r\na scrawny lad who heard your call \r\nfrom where dawns milling showers fall\r\npale meteors through sapphire air.\r\n\r\nI learned the eagerness of youth\r\nto temper for a lovers touch;\r\nI felt you, tremulant, reprove \r\neach time I fumbled over-much.\r\nYour merest word became my prayer.\r\n\r\nYou took me gently by the hand \r\nand led my steps from child to man;\r\nnow I look back, remember when\r\nyou shone, and cannot understand\r\nwhy now, tonight, you bear their brand.\r\n\r\nI will take and cradle you in my arms, \r\nremindful of the gentle charms\r\nyou showed me once, of yore;\r\nand I will lead you from your cell tonight\r\nback into that incandescent light\r\nwhich flows out of the core \r\nof a sun whose robes you wore.\r\nAnd I will wash your feet with tears \r\nfor all those blissful years . . .\r\nmy love, whom I adore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAllayne is an unusual poem in that it was written by a modern poet, Kevin N. \r\nRoberts, who claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon Charles Swinburne! And \r\nthere is, indeed, a strong reflection of Swinburne\'s lyricism in Roberts\' poem \r\n...\r\n\r\nAllayne\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nThe dawn of day is drawing near\r\nWould that explain\r\nWhy I should wake and find you here,\r\nMy lost Allayne?\r\n\r\nI see you wear the look of saints,\r\nThe face you feign,\r\nTo hide the hungry beast that waits\r\nTo strike, Allayne.\r\n\r\nBut parted lips betray the thirst\r\nYou can\'t restrain,\r\nAnd kissing them would make them burst\r\nAnd bleed, Allayne.\r\n\r\nSo relish now the single kiss\r\nReal love has lain,\r\nAnd when you die, remember this\r\nIn hell, Allayne:\r\n\r\nTo love you was my single sin\r\nCould I abstain?\r\nFair flesh has felled far better men\r\nThan I, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYour perfect mouth was made to please\r\nAnd bring me pain\r\nWith brazen teeth that taunt and tease\r\nMy soul, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThat I should chasten you by the rod\r\nThe gods ordain.\r\nWhat breed of fierce infernal god\r\nForged you, Allayne?\r\n\r\nWhat sort of strange sadistic spawn,\r\nWhat brand of bane,\r\nMade you a dark delicious pawn\r\nOf death, Allayne?\r\n\r\nWhen you were born, the devil swore\r\nHe would obtain\r\nYour body and the soul it bore\r\nWith shame, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYour Lord\'s perversely pulsing heart\r\nWas torn in twain\r\nThat he might place the blackest part\r\nIn you, Allayne.\r\n\r\nBut when he tore you from the womb\r\nDid you complain,\r\nOr did you like his torrid tomb\r\nMuch more, Allayne?\r\n\r\nHe filled you with each kind of curse\r\nYou could contain,\r\nAnd left you with a lust far worse\r\nThan his, Allayne.\r\n\r\nHenceforth you were his cherished prize\r\nAnd chatelaine;\r\nYou rule the world of grim demise\r\nWith glee, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYou hold his horde of fiends in thrall,\r\nA queen you reign,\r\nAnd walk in shadows where they fall,\r\nBy night, Allayne.\r\n\r\nAnd though you hate me for it, yet\r\nI still maintain,\r\nI love you, though you would forget\r\nI lived, Allayne.\r\n\r\nA sweet and subtly scented sea,\r\nYour splendid mane\r\nExcites my soul, enticing me\r\nTo drown, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYour shameless cryptic shoulder\'s curve\r\nIs half profane;\r\nIt shifts with fire in every nerve\r\nThat burns, Allayne.\r\n\r\nBut of your charms that mesmerise\r\nAnd seek to chain,\r\nYour brilliant black voracious eyes\r\nAre best, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThey seethe with all the eager slaves\r\nYour love has slain;\r\nYou sent them gladly to their graves\r\nAlone, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of your piercing teeth\r\nWould prick the vein\r\nAnd draw the flood that flows beneath\r\nThe flesh, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of their fleeting lives\r\nWould rush and rain\r\nTo feed the fiendish life that thrives\r\nIn you, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYou flourish by the fevered lips\r\nAnd life you drain;\r\nWith lusty sighs and hungry sips\r\nYou drink, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYou seem a vile, envenomed thing\r\nAnd less than sane;\r\nYour kiss so like a serpent\'s sting\r\nCan kill, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThe poison in that brutal kiss\r\nNow wracks my brain\r\nAnd sends my blood to mortal bliss\r\nIn you, Allayne.\r\n\r\nAgainst your scarlet silken dress\r\nThe nipples strain\r\nAnd raise to meet the hard caress\r\nYou crave, Allayne.\r\n\r\nBut you could never stoop to love,\r\nNor would you deign\r\nTo hold a mortal man above\r\nYourself, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYour only longing is for death\r\nAnd things arcane;\r\nYour breathing is the tainted breath\r\nOf tombs, Allayne.\r\n\r\nDestroying me will be the cost,\r\nAnd what you gain\r\nIs freedom from the soul you lost\r\nLong since, Allayne.\r\n\r\nBut when I\'m gone will you forget,\r\nOr entertain,\r\nThe passions you could not permit\r\nTo grow, Allayne?\r\n\r\nI\'ve one last wish, but would my wishing\r\nBe in vain?\r\nJust once, I\'d hear the hateful thing\r\nYou hide, Allayne.\r\n\r\nSo now I ask you to confess,\r\nBy love of Cain,\r\nThe joy it gives you to possess\r\nMy gift, Allayne.\r\n\r\nI leave you something that will stay,\r\nA fatal stain,\r\nThat you could never wash away\r\nWith blood, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThe touch of my deferring hand\r\nYou will retain,\r\nA touch you may well understand\r\nIn time, Allayne.\r\n\r\nUntil the end of all your days\r\nIt will remain,\r\nAnd then the fiend you dared to praise\r\nWill fall, Allayne.\r\n\r\nAngelic armies will descend\r\nAnd him arraign;\r\nThey\'ll bring about his brutal end\r\nOn earth, Allayne.\r\n\r\nThe remnant of his writhing form\r\nWill wax and wane\r\nAnd perish in a reeking storm\r\nOf dust, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll stand alone to face the fall\r\nOf his domain\r\nAnd watch the ruin of every wall\r\nHe built, Allayne.\r\n\r\nAnd then, my love, we both will see\r\nIf you disdain\r\nThe only soul that would not flee\r\nYour touch, Allayne.\r\n\r\nI sink into the strangest sleep,\r\nWhilst you sustain;\r\nAs dark as death and twice as deep\r\nI doze, Allayne.\r\n\r\nWith death die all my mortal fears\r\nI shan\'t regain,\r\nAnd I can wait a swarm of years\r\nFor you, Allayne.\r\n\r\nYou think you\'ve seen the last of me,\r\nYou slavish swain,\r\nBut mine will be the face you see\r\nIn dreams, Allayne.\r\n\r\nI swear it now, my wicked thing,\r\nWe\'ll meet again.\r\nThen will you wear the devil\'s ring...\r\nOr mine, Allayne?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Confession\r\nby the Archpoet\r\ncirca 1165; translated from the original Medieval Latin\r\nby Helen Waddell\r\n\r\n\r\nSeething over inwardly\r\nWith fierce indignation,\r\nIn my bitterness of soul,\r\nHear my declaration.\r\nI am of one element,\r\nLevity my matter,\r\nLike enough a withered leaf\r\nFor the winds to scatter.\r\n\r\nSince it is the property \r\nOf the sapient \r\nTo sit firm upon a rock, \r\nit is evident \r\nThat I am a fool, since I \r\nAm a flowing river, \r\nNever under the same sky, \r\nTransient for ever.\r\n\r\nHither, thither, masterless\r\nShip upon the sea,\r\nWandering through the ways of air,\r\nGo the birds like me.\r\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\r\nPrisoner to no key,\r\nQuesting go I for my kind,\r\nFind depravity. \r\n\r\nNever yet could I endure\r\nSoberness and sadness,\r\nJests I love and sweeter than\r\nHoney find I gladness. \r\nWhatsoever Venus bids\r\nIs a joy excelling,\r\nNever in an evil heart\r\nDid she make her dwelling.\r\n\r\nDown the broad way do I go, \r\nYoung and unregretting, \r\nWrap me in my vices up, \r\nVirtue all forgetting, \r\nGreedier for all delight \r\nThan heaven to enter in: \r\nSince the soul is in me dead, \r\nBetter save the skin.\r\n\r\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\r\nMaster of discretion,\r\nBut this death I die is sweet,\r\nMost delicious poison. \r\nWounded to the quick am I\r\nBy a young girl\'s beauty: \r\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\r\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\r\n\r\nHard beyond all hardness, this\r\nMastering of Nature:\r\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\r\nNear so fair a creature?\r\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\r\nHow should we obey it?\r\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\r\nShall they have no say in\'t?\r\n\r\nSit you down amid the fire,\r\nWill the fire not burn you?\r\nTo Pavia come, will you\r\nJust as chaste return you?\r\nPavia, where Beauty draws\r\nYouth with finger-tips,\r\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\r\nRavished with her lips.\r\n\r\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\r\nIn Pavia dine him,\r\nNever more Hippolytus\r\nWill the morning find him.\r\nIn Pavia not a road\r\nBut leads to venery\r\nNor among its crowding towers\r\nOne to chastity.\r\n\r\nYet a second charge they bring:\r\nI\'m forever gaming.\r\nYea, the dice hath many a time\r\nStripped me to my shaming.\r\nWhat an\' if the body\'s cold,\r\nIf the mind is burning,\r\nOn the anvil hammering,\r\nRhymes and verses turning?\r\n\r\nLook again upon your list. \r\nIs the tavern on it? \r\nYea, and never have I scorned,\r\nNever shall I scorn it,\r\nTill the holy angels come,\r\nAnd my eyes discern them, \r\nSinging for the dying soul, \r\nRequiem aeternam.\r\n\r\nFor on this my heart is set: \r\nWhen the hour is nigh me, \r\nLet me in the tavern die, \r\nWith a tankard by me, \r\nWhile the angels looking down \r\nJoyously sing o\'er me, \r\nDeus sit propitius \r\nHuic potatori.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\r\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\r\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\r\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\r\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\r\nIn a tavern tankard\r\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\r\nBishop has decanted.\r\n\r\nLet them fast and water drink,\r\nAll the poets\' chorus,\r\nFly the market and the crowd\r\nRacketing uproarious.\r\nSit in quiet spots and think,\r\nShun the tavern\'s portal\r\nWrite, and never having lived,\r\nDie to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNever hath the spirit of\r\nPoetry descended,\r\nTill with food and drink my lean\r\nBelly was distended,\r\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\r\nMy cerebral story,\r\nComes Apollo with a rush,\r\nFills me with his glory.\r\n\r\nUnto every man his gift.\r\nMine was not for fasting.\r\nNever could I find a rhyme\r\nWith my stomach wasting.\r\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\r\n\'Tis a better chorus\r\nWhen the landlord hath a good \r\nVintage set before us.\r\n\r\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\r\nI myself betray me,\r\nAnd affirm myself to be\r\nAll my fellows say me.\r\nSee, they in thy presence are:\r\nLet whoe\'er hath known\r\nHis own heart and found it clean,\r\nCast at me the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet America Be America Again\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\nLet America be America again.\r\nLet it be the dream it used to be.\r\nLet it be the pioneer on the plain\r\nSeeking a home where he himself is free.\r\n(America never was America to me.)\r\nLet America be the dream the dreamers dreamed\r\nLet it be that great strong land of love\r\nWhere never kings connive nor tyrants scheme\r\nThat any man be crushed by one above.\r\n(It never was America to me.)\r\nO, let my land be a land where Liberty\r\nIs crowned with no false patriotic wreath,\r\nBut opportunity is real, and life is free,\r\nEquality is in the air we breathe.\r\n(There\'s never been equality for me,\r\nNor freedom in this homeland of the free.)\r\nSay, who are you that mumbles in the dark?\r\nAnd who are you that draws your veil across the stars?\r\nI am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,\r\nI am the Negro bearing slavery\'s scars.\r\nI am the red man driven from the land,\r\nI am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek\r\nAnd finding only the same old stupid plan\r\nOf dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.\r\nI am the young man, full of strength and hope,\r\nTangled in that ancient endless chain\r\nOf profit, power, gain, of grab the land!\r\nOf grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!\r\nOf work the men! Of take the pay!\r\nOf owning everything for one\'s own greed!\r\nI am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.\r\nI am the worker sold to the machine.\r\nI am the Negro, servant to you all.\r\nI am the people, humble, hungry, mean\r\nHungry yet today despite the dream.\r\nBeaten yet todayO, Pioneers!\r\nI am the man who never got ahead,\r\nThe poorest worker bartered through the years.\r\nYet I\'m the one who dreamt our basic dream\r\nIn the Old World while still a serf of kings,\r\nWho dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,\r\nThat even yet its mighty daring sings\r\nIn every brick and stone, in every furrow turned\r\nThat\'s made America the land it has become.\r\nO, I\'m the man who sailed those early seas\r\nIn search of what I meant to be my home\r\nFor I\'m the one who left dark Ireland\'s shore,\r\nAnd Poland\'s plain, and England\'s grassy lea,\r\nAnd torn from Black Africa\'s strand I came\r\nTo build a homeland of the free.\r\nThe free?\r\nWho said the free? Not me?\r\nSurely not me? The millions on relief today?\r\nThe millions shot down when we strike?\r\nThe millions who have nothing for our pay?\r\nFor all the dreams we\'ve dreamed\r\nAnd all the songs we\'ve sung\r\nAnd all the hopes we\'ve held\r\nAnd all the flags we\'ve hung,\r\nThe millions who have nothing for our pay\r\nExcept the dream that\'s almost dead today.\r\nO, let America be America again\r\nThe land that never has been yet\r\nAnd yet must bethe land where every man is free.\r\nThe land that\'s minethe poor man\'s, Indian\'s, Negro\'s, ME\r\nWho made America,\r\nWhose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,\r\nWhose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,\r\nMust bring back our mighty dream again.\r\nSure, call me any ugly name you choose\r\nThe steel of freedom does not stain.\r\nFrom those who live like leeches on the people\'s lives,\r\nWe must take back our land again,\r\nAmerica!\r\nO, yes,\r\nI say it plain,\r\nAmerica never was America to me,\r\nAnd yet I swear this oath\r\nAmerica will be!\r\nOut of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,\r\nThe rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,\r\nWe, the people, must redeem\r\nThe land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.\r\nThe mountains and the endless plain\r\nAll, all the stretch of these great green states\r\nAnd make America again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChurch Going\r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nOnce I am sure there\'s nothing going on\r\nI step inside, letting the door thud shut.\r\nAnother church: matting, seats, and stone,\r\nAnd little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut\r\nFor Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff\r\nUp at the holy end; the small neat organ;\r\nAnd a tense, musty, unignorable silence,\r\nBrewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off\r\nMy cycle-clips in awkward reverence,\r\n\r\nMove forward, run my hand around the font.\r\nFrom where I stand, the roof looks almost new\r\nCleaned or restored? Someone would know: I don\'t.\r\nMounting the lectern, I peruse a few\r\nHectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce\r\nHere endeth much more loudly than I\'d meant.\r\nThe echoes snigger briefly. Back at the door\r\nI sign the book, donate an Irish sixpence,\r\nReflect the place was not worth stopping for.\r\n\r\nYet stop I did: in fact I often do,\r\nAnd always end much at a loss like this,\r\nWondering what to look for; wondering, too,\r\nWhen churches fall completely out of use\r\nWhat we shall turn them into, if we shall keep\r\nA few cathedrals chronically on show,\r\nTheir parchment, plate, and pyx in locked cases,\r\nAnd let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.\r\nShall we avoid them as unlucky places?\r\n\r\nOr, after dark, will dubious women come\r\nTo make their children touch a particular stone;\r\nPick simples for a cancer; or on some\r\nAdvised night see walking a dead one?\r\nPower of some sort or other will go on\r\nIn games, in riddles, seemingly at random;\r\nBut superstition, like belief, must die,\r\nAnd what remains when disbelief has gone?\r\nGrass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,\r\n\r\nA shape less recognizable each week,\r\nA purpose more obscure. I wonder who\r\nWill be the last, the very last, to seek\r\nThis place for what it was; one of the crew\r\nThat tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were?\r\nSome ruin-bibber, randy for antique,\r\nOr Christmas-addict, counting on a whiff\r\nOf gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh?\r\nOr will he be my representative,\r\n\r\nBored, uninformed, knowing the ghostly silt\r\nDispersed, yet tending to this cross of ground\r\nThrough suburb scrub because it held unspilt\r\nSo long and equably what since is found\r\nOnly in separationmarriage, and birth,\r\nAnd death, and thoughts of thesefor whom was built\r\nThis special shell? For, though I\'ve no idea\r\nWhat this accoutred frowsty barn is worth,\r\nIt pleases me to stand in silence here;\r\n\r\nA serious house on serious earth it is,\r\nIn whose blent air all our compulsions meet,\r\nAre recognised, and robed as destinies.\r\nAnd that much never can be obsolete,\r\nSince someone will forever be surprising\r\nA hunger in himself to be more serious,\r\nAnd gravitating with it to this ground,\r\nWhich, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,\r\nIf only that so many dead lie round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOde : Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\r\nThe earth, and every common sight,\r\nTo me did seem\r\nApparell\'d in celestial light,\r\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\r\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore;\r\nTurn wheresoe\'er I may,\r\nBy night or day,\r\nThe things which I have seen I now can see no more.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow comes and goes,\r\nAnd lovely is the rose;\r\nThe moon doth with delight\r\nLook round her when the heavens are bare;\r\nWaters on a starry night\r\nAre beautiful and fair;\r\nThe sunshine is a glorious birth;\r\nBut yet I know, where\'er I go,\r\nThat there hath pass\'d away a glory from the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,\r\nAnd while the young lambs bound\r\nAs to the tabor\'s sound,\r\nTo me alone there came a thought of grief:\r\nA timely utterance gave that thought relief,\r\nAnd I again am strong:\r\nThe cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;\r\nNo more shall grief of mine the season wrong;\r\nI hear the echoes through the mountains throng,\r\nThe winds come to me from the fields of sleep,\r\nAnd all the earth is gay;\r\nLand and sea\r\nGive themselves up to jollity,\r\nAnd with the heart of May\r\nDoth every beast keep holiday;\r\n Thou Child of Joy,\r\nShout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!\r\n\r\nYe bless\xe8d creatures, I have heard the call\r\nYe to each other make; I see\r\nThe heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;\r\nMy heart is at your festival,\r\nMy head hath its coronal,\r\nThe fulness of your bliss, I feelI feel it all.\r\nO evil day! if I were sullen\r\nWhile Earth herself is adorning,\r\nThis sweet May-morning,\r\n And the children are culling\r\n On every side,\r\nIn a thousand valleys far and wide,\r\nFresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,\r\nAnd the babe leaps up on his mother\'s arm:\r\nI hear, I hear, with joy I hear!\r\nBut there\'s a tree, of many, one,\r\nA single field which I have look\'d upon,\r\nBoth of them speak of something that is gone:\r\nThe pansy at my feet\r\nDoth the same tale repeat:\r\nWhither is fled the visionary gleam?\r\nWhere is it now, the glory and the dream?\r\n\r\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\r\nThe Soul that rises with us, our life\'s Star,\r\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\r\nAnd cometh from afar:\r\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\r\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\r\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\nFrom God, who is our home:\r\nHeaven lies about us in our infancy!\r\nShades of the prison-house begin to close\r\nUpon the growing Boy,\r\nBut he \r\nBeholds the light, and whence it flows,\r\nHe sees it in his joy;\r\nThe Youth, who daily farther from the east\r\nMust travel, still is Nature\'s priest,\r\nAnd by the vision splendid\r\nIs on his way attended;\r\nAt length the Man perceives it die away,\r\nAnd fade into the light of common day.\r\n\r\nEarth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;\r\nYearnings she hath in her own natural kind,\r\nAnd, even with something of a mother\'s mind,\r\nAnd no unworthy aim,\r\nThe homely nurse doth all she can\r\nTo make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,\r\nForget the glories he hath known,\r\nAnd that imperial palace whence he came.\r\n\r\nBehold the Child among his new-born blisses,\r\nA six years\' darling of a pigmy size!\r\nSee, where \'mid work of his own hand he lies,\r\nFretted by sallies of his mother\'s kisses,\r\nWith light upon him from his father\'s eyes!\r\nSee, at his feet, some little plan or chart,\r\nSome fragment from his dream of human life,\r\nShaped by himself with newly-learn\xe8d art;\r\nA wedding or a festival,\r\nA mourning or a funeral;\r\nAnd this hath now his heart,\r\nAnd unto this he frames his song:\r\nThen will he fit his tongue\r\nTo dialogues of business, love, or strife;\r\nBut it will not be long\r\nEre this be thrown aside,\r\nAnd with new joy and pride\r\nThe little actor cons another part;\r\nFilling from time to time his \'humorous stage\'\r\nWith all the Persons, down to palsied Age,\r\nThat Life brings with her in her equipage;\r\nAs if his whole vocation\r\nWere endless imitation.\r\n\r\nThou, whose exterior semblance doth belie\r\nThy soul\'s immensity;\r\nThou best philosopher, who yet dost keep\r\nThy heritage, thou eye among the blind,\r\nThat, deaf and silent, read\'st the eternal deep,\r\nHaunted for ever by the eternal mind,\r\nMighty prophet! Seer blest!\r\nOn whom those truths do rest,\r\nWhich we are toiling all our lives to find,\r\nIn darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;\r\nThou, over whom thy Immortality\r\nBroods like the Day, a master o\'er a slave,\r\nA presence which is not to be put by;\r\n\r\nTo whom the grave\r\nIs but a lonely bed without the sense or sight\r\n\r\nOf day or the warm light,\r\nA place of thought where we in waiting lie;\r\nThou little Child, yet glorious in the might\r\nOf heaven-born freedom on thy being\'s height,\r\nWhy with such earnest pains dost thou provoke\r\nThe years to bring the inevitable yoke,\r\nThus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?\r\nFull soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,\r\nAnd custom lie upon thee with a weight,\r\nHeavy as frost, and deep almost as life!\r\n\r\nO joy! that in our embers\r\nIs something that doth live,\r\nThat nature yet remembers\r\nWhat was so fugitive!\r\nThe thought of our past years in me doth breed\r\nPerpetual benediction: not indeed\r\nFor that which is most worthy to be blest\r\nDelight and liberty, the simple creed\r\nOf childhood, whether busy or at rest,\r\nWith new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:\r\nNot for these I raise\r\nThe song of thanks and praise;\r\nBut for those obstinate questionings\r\nOf sense and outward things,\r\nFallings from us, vanishings;\r\nBlank misgivings of a Creature\r\nMoving about in worlds not realized,\r\nHigh instincts before which our mortal Nature\r\nDid tremble like a guilty thing surprised:\r\nBut for those first affections,\r\nThose shadowy recollections,\r\nWhich, be they what they may,\r\nAre yet the fountain-light of all our day,\r\nAre yet a master-light of all our seeing;\r\nUphold us, cherish, and have power to make\r\nOur noisy years seem moments in the being\r\nOf the eternal Silence: truths that wake,\r\nTo perish never:\r\nWhich neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,\r\nNor Man nor Boy,\r\nNor all that is at enmity with joy,\r\nCan utterly abolish or destroy!\r\nHence in a season of calm weather\r\nThough inland far we be,\r\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\r\nWhich brought us hither,\r\nCan in a moment travel thither,\r\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\r\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\r\n\r\nThen sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!\r\nAnd let the young lambs bound\r\nAs to the tabor\'s sound!\r\nWe in thought will join your throng,\r\nYe that pipe and ye that play,\r\nYe that through your hearts to-day\r\nFeel the gladness of the May!\r\nWhat though the radiance which was once so bright\r\nBe now for ever taken from my sight,\r\nThough nothing can bring back the hour\r\nOf splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\r\nWe will grieve not, rather find\r\nStrength in what remains behind;\r\nIn the primal sympathy\r\nWhich having been must ever be;\r\nIn the soothing thoughts that spring\r\nOut of human suffering;\r\nIn the faith that looks through death,\r\nIn years that bring the philosophic mind.\r\n\r\nAnd O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,\r\nForebode not any severing of our loves!\r\nYet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;\r\nI only have relinquish\'d one delight\r\nTo live beneath your more habitual sway.\r\nI love the brooks which down their channels fret,\r\nEven more than when I tripp\'d lightly as they;\r\nThe innocent brightness of a new-born Day\r\nIs lovely yet;\r\nThe clouds that gather round the setting sun\r\nDo take a sober colouring from an eye\r\nThat hath kept watch o\'er man\'s mortality;\r\nAnother race hath been, and other palms are won.\r\nThanks to the human heart by which we live,\r\nThanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,\r\nTo me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\nThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nS\'io credesse che mia risposta fosse\r\n A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\r\n Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.\r\n Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo\r\n Non torno vivo alcun, s\'i\'odo il vero,\r\nSenza tema d\'infamia ti rispondo.[1]\r\n\r\nLet us go then, you and I,\r\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\r\nLike a patient etherised upon a table;\r\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\r\nThe muttering retreats\r\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\r\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\r\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\r\nOf insidious intent\r\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question .\r\nOh, do not ask, What is it?\r\nLet us go and make our visit.\r\n\r\nIn the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the\r\nwindow-panes,\r\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\r\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\r\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\r\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\r\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\r\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\r\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there will be time\r\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\r\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\r\nThere will be time, there will be time\r\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\r\nThere will be time to murder and create,\r\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\r\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\r\nTime for you and time for me,\r\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\r\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\r\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\r\n\r\nIn the room the women come and go\r\nTalking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there will be time\r\nTo wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?\r\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\r\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\r\n[They will say: How his hair is growing thin!]\r\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\r\n[They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!]\r\nDo I dare\r\nDisturb the universe?\r\nIn a minute there is time\r\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\nFor I have known them all already, known them all:\r\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\r\n So how should I presume?\r\n\r\nAnd I have known the eyes already, known them all\r\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\nThen how should I begin\r\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n And how should I presume?\r\n\r\nAnd I have known the arms already, known them all\r\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]\r\nIt is perfume from a dress\r\nThat makes me so digress?\r\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n And should I then presume?\r\n And how should I begin?\r\n\r\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .\r\n\r\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\r\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\nSmoothed by long fingers,\r\nAsleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,\r\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\nThough I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,\r\nI am no prophetand here\'s no great matter;\r\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\nTo say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\r\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n Should say: That is not what I meant at all.\r\n That is not it, at all.\r\n\r\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\r\nfloor\r\nAnd this, and so much more?\r\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\nWould it have been worth while\r\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\r\n That is not it at all,\r\n That is not what I meant, at all.\r\n\r\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\r\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\r\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\r\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\r\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\r\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\r\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\r\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\r\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\r\n\r\nI grow old . . . I grow old . . .\r\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\r\n\r\nShall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\r\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\r\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\r\n\r\nI do not think that they will sing to me.\r\n\r\nI have seen them riding seaward on the waves\r\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\r\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\r\n\r\nWe have lingered in the chambers of the sea\r\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\r\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\r\n\r\n[1] Dante, Inferno 27.61-66 If I thought my answer were\r\ngiven / to anyone who would ever return to the world, / this flame would stand\r\nstill without moving any further. / But since never from this abyss / has anyone\r\never returned alive, if what I hear is true, /without fear of infamy I answer\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoricos\r\nby Richard Aldington\r\n\r\nThe ancient songs \r\nPass deathward mournfully.\r\n\r\nCold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,\r\nRegretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings\r\nSymbols of ancient songs\r\nMournfully passing\r\nDown to the great white surges,\r\nWatched of none\r\nSave the frail sea-birds\r\nAnd the lithe pale girls,\r\nDaughters of Okeanos.\r\n\r\nAnd the songs pass\r\nFrom the green land\r\nWhich lies upon the waves as a leaf \r\nOn the flowers of hyacinth;\r\nAnd they pass from the waters,\r\nThe manifold winds and the dim moon,\r\nAnd they come,\r\nSilently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,\r\nTo the quiet level lands\r\nThat she keeps for us all,\r\nThat she wrought for us all for sleep\r\nIn the silver days of the earths dawning\r\nProsperine, daughter of Zeus. \r\n\r\nAnd we turn from the Kuprians breasts, \r\nAnd we turn from thee,\r\nPhoibos Apollon,\r\nAnd we turn from the music of old\r\nAnd the hills that we loved and the meads,\r\nAnd we turn from the fiery day,\r\nAnd the lips that were over-sweet;\r\nFor silently\r\nBrushing the fields with red-shod feet,\r\nWith purple robe\r\nSearing the flowers as with a sudden flame,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou hast come upon us. \r\n\r\nAnd of all the ancient songs\r\nPassing to the swallow-blue halls\r\nBy the dark streams of Persephone,\r\nThis only remains:\r\nThat in the end we turn to thee,\r\nDeath,\r\nThat we turn to thee, singing \r\nOne last song.\r\n\r\nO Death,\r\nThou art an healing wind\r\nThat blowest over white flowers\r\nA-tremble with dew;\r\nThou art a wind flowing\r\nOver long leagues of lonely sea;\r\nThou art the dusk and the fragrance;\r\nThou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;\r\nThou art the pale peace of one\r\nSatiate with old desires;\r\nThou art the silence of beauty,\r\nAnd we look no more for the morning;\r\nWe yearn no more for the sun, \r\nSince with thy white hands,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,\r\nThe slim colorless poppies\r\nWhich in thy garden alone\r\nSoftly thou gatherest.\r\n\r\nAnd silently;\r\nAnd with slow feet approaching;\r\nAnd with bowed head and unlit eyes, \r\nWe kneel before thee.\r\nAnd thou, leaning towards us, \r\nCaressingly layest upon us\r\nFlowers from thy thin cold hands,\r\nAnd, smiling as a chaste woman\r\nKnowing love in her heart,\r\nThou sealest our eyes\r\nAnd the illimitable quietude\r\nComes gently upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirective\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\r\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\r\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\r\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\r\nThere is a house that is no more a house\r\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\r\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\r\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\r\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\r\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry\r\nGreat monolithic knees the former town\r\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\r\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\r\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\r\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\r\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\r\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\r\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\r\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\r\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\r\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\r\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\r\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\r\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\r\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\r\nThey think too much of having shaded out\r\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\r\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\r\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\r\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\r\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\r\nThe height of the adventure is the height\r\nOf country where two village cultures faded\r\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHurt Hawks\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nThe broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,\r\nThe wing trails like a banner in defeat,\r\nNo more to use the sky forever but live with famine\r\nAnd pain a few days: cat nor coyote\r\nWill shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.\r\nHe stands under the oak-bush and waits\r\nThe lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom\r\nAnd flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it.\r\nHe is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.\r\nThe curs of the day come and torment him\r\nAt distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head,\r\nThe intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.\r\nThe wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those\r\nThat ask mercy, not often to the arrogant.\r\nYou do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him;\r\nIntemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;\r\nBeautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.\r\n\r\nI\'d sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtail\r\nHad nothing left but unable misery\r\nFrom the bones too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons \r\nwhen he moved.\r\nWe had fed him for six weeks, I gave him freedom,\r\nHe wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for \r\ndeath,\r\nNot like a beggar, still eyed with the old\r\nImplacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was \r\nrelaxed,\r\nOwl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what\r\nSoared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its \r\nrising\r\nBefore it was quite unsheathed from reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Broken Tower\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\r\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\r\nOf a spent dayto wander the cathedral lawn\r\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\r\n\r\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\r\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\r\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\r\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\r\n\r\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\r\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping\r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hopecleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)but slip\r\nOf pebbles,visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fish\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nI caught a tremendous fish\r\nand held him beside the boat\r\nhalf out of water, with my hook\r\nfast in a corner of his mouth.\r\nHe didn\'t fight.\r\nHe hadn\'t fought at all.\r\nHe hung a grunting weight,\r\nbattered and venerable\r\nand homely.  Here and there\r\nhis brown skin hung in strips\r\nlike ancient wallpaper,\r\nand its pattern of darker brown\r\nwas like wallpaper:\r\nshapes like full-blown roses\r\nstained and lost through age.\r\nHe was speckled with barnacles,\r\nfine rosettes of lime,\r\nand infested\r\nwith tiny white sea-lice,\r\nand underneath two or three\r\nrags of green weed hung down.\r\nWhile his gills were breathing in\r\nthe terrible oxygen\r\nthe frightening gills,\r\nfresh and crisp with blood,\r\nthat can cut so badly\r\nI thought of the coarse white flesh\r\npacked in like feathers,\r\nthe big bones and the little bones,\r\nthe dramatic reds and blacks\r\nof his shiny entrails,\r\nand the pink swim-bladder\r\nlike a big peony.\r\nI looked into his eyes\r\nwhich were far larger than mine\r\nbut shallower, and yellowed,\r\nthe irises backed and packed\r\nwith tarnished tinfoil\r\nseen through the lenses\r\nof old scratched isinglass.\r\nThey shifted a little, but not\r\nto return my stare.\r\nIt was more like the tipping\r\nof an object toward the light.\r\nI admired his sullen face,\r\nthe mechanism of his jaw,\r\nand then I saw\r\nthat from his lower lip\r\nif you could call it a lip \r\ngrim, wet, and weaponlike,\r\nhung five old pieces of fish-line,\r\nor four and a wire leader\r\nwith the swivel still attached,\r\nwith all their five big hooks\r\ngrown firmly in his mouth.\r\nA green line, frayed at the end\r\nwhere he broke it, two heavier lines, \r\nand a fine black thread\r\nstill crimped from the strain and snap\r\nwhen it broke and he got away.\r\nLike medals with their ribbons\r\nfrayed and wavering,\r\na five-haired beard of wisdom\r\ntrailing from his aching jaw.\r\nI stared and stared\r\nand victory filled up\r\nthe little rented boat,\r\nfrom the pool of bilge\r\nwhere oil had spread a rainbow\r\naround the rusted engine\r\nto the bailer rusted orange,\r\nthe sun-cracked thwarts,\r\nthe oarlocks on their strings,\r\nthe gunnelsuntil everything\r\nwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!\r\nAnd I let the fish go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBagpipe Music\r\nby Louis MacNeice\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\r\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the \r\npeepshow.\r\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes \r\nare made of python,\r\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls \r\nwith head of bison.\r\n\r\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\r\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\r\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\r\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\r\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a \r\ntaxi.\r\n\r\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the \r\nheather,\r\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\r\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\r\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the \r\npuncture.\r\n\r\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was \r\nsober,\r\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one \r\nfoot over.\r\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with \r\nrepulsion,\r\nSaid to the midwife Take it away;

Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling \r\nswivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let \r\nme\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\r\n They call it easing the Spring.\r\n\r\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\r\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of \r\nbalance,\r\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the \r\nalmond-blossom\r\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going \r\nbackwards and forwards,\r\n For today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop\r\nfor Robert Lowell\r\n\r\n      This is the time of year\r\n      when almost every night\r\n      the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.\r\n      Climbing the mountain height,\r\n      \r\n      rising toward a saint\r\n      still honored in these parts,\r\n      the paper chambers flush and fill with light\r\n      that comes and goes, like hearts.\r\n      \r\n      Once up against the sky it\'s hard\r\n      to tell them from the stars\r\n      planets, that isthe tinted ones:\r\n      Venus going down, or Mars,\r\n      \r\n      or the pale green one. With a wind,\r\n      they flare and falter, wobble and toss;\r\n      but if it\'s still they steer between\r\n      the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,\r\n      \r\n      receding, dwindling, solemnly\r\n      and steadily forsaking us,\r\n      or, in the downdraft from a peak,\r\n      suddenly turning dangerous.\r\n      \r\n      Last night another big one fell.\r\n      It splattered like an egg of fire\r\n      against the cliff behind the house.\r\n      The flame ran down. We saw the pair\r\n      \r\n      of owls who nest there flying up\r\n      and up, their whirling black-and-white\r\n      stained bright pink underneath, until\r\n      they shrieked up out of sight.\r\n      \r\n      The ancient owls\' nest must have burned.\r\n      Hastily, all alone,\r\n      a glistening armadillo left the scene,\r\n      rose-flecked, head down, tail down,\r\n      \r\n      and then a baby rabbit jumped out,\r\n      short-eared, to our surprise.\r\n      So soft!a handful of intangible ash\r\n      with fixed, ignited eyes.\r\n      \r\n      Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!\r\n      O falling fire and piercing cry\r\n      and panic, and a weak mailed fist\r\n      clenched ignorant against the sky!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convergence Of The Twain by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nLines on the loss of the Titanic\r\n\r\nIn a solitude of the sea\r\nDeep from human vanity,\r\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\r\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\r\nOf her salamandrine fires,\r\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\r\nOver the mirrors meant\r\nTo glass the opulent\r\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\r\nJewels in joy designed\r\n To ravish the sensuous mind\r\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\r\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\r\n Gaze at the gilded gear\r\nAnd query: What does this vaingloriousness down here?...\r\nWell: while was fashioning\r\n This creature of cleaving wing,\r\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\r\n Prepared a sinister mate\r\n For herso gaily great\r\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\r\n And as the smart ship grew\r\n In stature, grace, and hue,\r\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\r\n Alien they seemed to be;\r\n No mortal eye could see\r\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\r\n Or sign that they were bent\r\n By paths coincident\r\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\r\n Till the Spinner of the Years\r\n Said Now!

Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n    \r\nNote:  Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\n    from Horace\'s Odes and means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\n    to die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\n      Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n    \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n    \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of Solomon\r\nattributed to King Solomon\r\n\r\nI am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\nAs the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\nAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.\r\nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\nHe brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.\r\nStay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.\r\nHis left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.\r\nI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,\r\nand by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.\r\n\r\nThe voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.\r\nMy beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall,\r\nhe looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.\r\nMy beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.\r\nFor, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;\r\nThe flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,\r\nand the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;\r\nThe fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell.\r\nArise, my love, my fair one, and come away.\r\n\r\nO my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance,\r\nlet me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\r\nTake us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.\r\n\r\nMy beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.\r\nUntil the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,\r\nand be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs My Team Plowing\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIs my team ploughing,\r\nThat I was used to drive\r\nAnd hear the harness jingle\r\nWhen I was man alive?\r\n\r\nAy, the horses trample,\r\nThe harness jingles now;\r\nNo change though you lie under\r\nThe land you used to plough.\r\n\r\nIs football playing\r\nAlong the river shore,\r\nWith lads to chase the leather,\r\nNow I stand up no more?\r\n\r\nAy, the ball is flying,\r\nThe lads play heart and soul;\r\nThe goal stands up, the keeper\r\nStands up to keep the goal.\r\n\r\nIs my girl happy,\r\nThat I thought hard to leave,\r\nAnd has she tired of weeping\r\nAs she lies down at eve?\r\n\r\nAy, she lies down lightly,\r\nShe lies not down to weep,\r\nYour girl is well contented.\r\nBe still, my lad, and sleep.\r\n\r\nIs my friend hearty,\r\nNow I am thin and pine,\r\nAnd has he found to sleep in\r\nA better bed than mine?\r\n\r\nYes, lad, I lie easy,\r\nI lie as lads would choose;\r\nI cheer a dead man\'s sweetheart,\r\nNever ask me whose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Waif \r\n\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\nThe day is done, and the darkness\r\nFalls from the wings of Night,\r\nAs a feather is wafted downward\r\nFrom an eagle in his flight.\r\n\r\nI see the lights of the village\r\nGleam through the rain and the mist,\r\nAnd a feeling of sadness comes o\'er me\r\nThat my soul cannot resist:\r\n\r\nA feeling of sadness and longing,\r\nThat is not akin to pain,\r\nAnd resembles sorrow only\r\nAs the mist resembles the rain.\r\n\r\nCome, read to me some poem,\r\nSome simple and heartfelt lay,\r\nThat shall soothe this restless feeling,\r\nAnd banish the thoughts of day.\r\n\r\nNot from the grand old masters,\r\nNot from the bards sublime,\r\nWhose distant footsteps echo\r\nThrough the corridors of Time,\r\n\r\nFor, like strains of martial music,\r\nTheir mighty thoughts suggest\r\nLife\'s endless toil and endeavor;\r\nAnd tonight I long for rest.\r\n\r\nRead from some humbler poet,\r\nWhose songs gushed from his heart,\r\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\r\nOr tears from the eyelids start;\r\n\r\nWho, through long days of labor,\r\nAnd nights devoid of ease,\r\nStill heard in his soul the music\r\nOf wonderful melodies.\r\n\r\nSuch songs have a power to quiet\r\nThe restless pulse of care,\r\nAnd comes like the benediction\r\nThat follows after prayer.\r\n\r\nThen read from the treasured volume\r\nThe poem of thy choice,\r\nAnd lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\nThe beauty of thy voice.\r\n\r\nAnd the night shall be filled with music,\r\nAnd the cares, that infest the day,\r\nShall fold their tents, like the Arabs,\r\nAnd as silently steal away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO Black and Unknown Bards\r\nby James Weldon Johnson\r\n\r\n    O black and unknown bards of long ago,\r\n    How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?\r\n    How, in your darkness, did you come to know\r\n    The power and beauty of the minstrel\'s lyre?\r\n    Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?\r\n    Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,\r\n    Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise\r\n    Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?\r\n\r\n    Heart of what slave poured out such melody\r\n    As Steal away to Jesus? On its strains\r\n    His spirit must have nightly floated free,\r\n    Though still about his hands he felt his chains.\r\n    Who heard great Jordan roll? Whose starward eye\r\n    Saw chariot swing low? And who was he\r\n    That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,\r\n    Nobody knows de trouble I see?\r\n\r\n    What merely living clod, what captive thing,\r\n    Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,\r\n    And find within its deadened heart to sing\r\n    These songs of sorrow, love, and faith, and hope?\r\n    How did it catch that subtle undertone,\r\n    That note in music heard not with the ears?\r\n    How \r\n    sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,\r\n    Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.\r\n\r\n    Not that great German master in his dream\r\n    Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars\r\n    At the creation, ever heard a theme\r\n    Nobler than Go down, Moses. Mark its bars,\r\n    How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir\r\n    The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung\r\n    Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were\r\n    That helped make history when Time was young.\r\n\r\n    There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,\r\n    That from degraded rest and servile toil\r\n    The fiery spirit of the seer should call\r\n    These simple children of the sun and soil.\r\n    O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,\r\n    Youyou alone, of all the long, long line\r\n    Of those who\'ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,\r\n    Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.\r\n\r\n    You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;\r\n    No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean\r\n    Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings\r\n    You touched in chord with music empyrean.\r\n    You \r\n    sang far better than you knew; the songs\r\n    That for your listeners\' hungry hearts sufficed\r\n    Still live,but more than this to you belongs:\r\n    You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dead Man Walking by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nThey hail me as one living, \r\nBut don\'t they know \r\nThat I have died of late years, \r\nUntombed although? \r\n\r\nI am but a shape that stands here, \r\nA pulseless mould, \r\nA pale past picture, screening \r\nAshes gone cold. \r\n\r\nNot at a minute\'s warning, \r\nNot in a loud hour, \r\nFor me ceased Time\'s enchantments \r\nIn hall and bower. \r\n\r\nThere was no tragic transit, \r\nNo catch of breath, \r\nWhen silent seasons inched me \r\nOn to this death .... \r\n\r\nA Troubadour-youth I rambled\r\nWith Life for lyre, \r\nThe beats of being raging \r\nIn me like fire. \r\n\r\nBut when I practised eyeing \r\nThe goal of men, \r\nIt iced me, and I perished \r\nA little then. \r\n\r\nWhen passed my friend, my kinsfolk, \r\nThrough the Last Door, \r\nAnd left me standing bleakly, \r\nI died yet more; \r\n\r\nAnd when my Love\'s heart kindled \r\nIn hate of me, \r\nWherefore I knew not, died I \r\nOne more degree. \r\n\r\nAnd if when I died fully \r\nI cannot say, \r\nAnd changed into the corpse-thing \r\nI am to-day, \r\n\r\nYet is it that, though whiling \r\nThe time somehow \r\nIn walking, talking, smiling, \r\nI live not now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pelagian Drinking Song \r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nPelagius lived at Kardanoel\r\nAnd taught a doctrine there\r\nHow, whether you went to heaven or to hell\r\nIt was your own affair.\r\nIt had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,\r\nBut was your own affair.\r\n\r\nNo, he didn\'t believe\r\nIn Adam and Eve\r\nHe put no faith therein!\r\nHis doubts began\r\nWith the Fall of Man\r\nAnd he laughed at Original Sin.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nHe laughed at original sin.\r\n\r\nThen came the bishop of old Auxerre\r\nGermanus was his name\r\nHe tore great handfuls out of his hair\r\nAnd he called Pelagius shame.\r\nAnd with his stout Episcopal staff\r\nSo thoroughly whacked and banged\r\nThe heretics all, both short and tall\r\nThey rather had been hanged.\r\n\r\nOh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long\r\nUpon each and all occasions\r\nTill they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\n\r\nNow the faith is old and the Devil bold\r\nExceedingly bold indeed.\r\nAnd the masses of doubt that are floating about\r\nWould smother a mortal creed.\r\nBut we that sit in a sturdy youth\r\nAnd still can drink strong ale\r\nLet us put it away to infallible truth\r\nThat always shall prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd thank the Lord\r\nFor the temporal sword\r\nAnd howling heretics too.\r\nAnd all good things\r\nOur Christendom brings\r\nBut especially barley brew!\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nEspecially barley brew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Una\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI built her a tower when I was young\r\nSometime she will die\r\nI built it with my hands, I hung\r\nStones in the sky.\r\n\r\nOld but still strong I climb the stone\r\nSometime she will die\r\nClimb the steep rough steps alone,\r\nAnd weep in the sky.\r\n\r\nNever weep, never weep.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNever be astonished, dear.\r\nExpect change,\r\nNothing is strange.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the human race\r\nCapture all its dreams,\r\nAll except peace.\r\n\r\nWe have watched mankind like Christ\r\nToil up and up,\r\nTo be hanged at the top.\r\n\r\nNo longer envying the birds,\r\nThat ancient prayer for\r\nWings granted: therefore\r\n\r\nThe heavy sky over London\r\nStallion-hoofed\r\nFalls on the roofs.\r\n\r\nThese are the falling years,\r\nThey will go deep,\r\nNever weep, never weep.\r\n\r\nWith clear eyes explore the pit.\r\nWatch the great fall\r\nWith religious awe.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt is not Europe alone that is falling\r\nInto blood and fire.\r\nDecline and fall have been dancing in all men\'s souls\r\nFor a long while.\r\n\r\nSometime at the last gasp comes peace\r\nTo every soul.\r\nNever to mine until I find out and speak\r\nThe things that I know.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I will take up that heavy poem again\r\nAbout Ferguson, deceived and jealous man\r\nWho bawled for the truth, the truth, and failed to endure\r\nIts first least gleam. That poem bores me, and I hope will bore\r\nAny sweet soul that reads it, being some ways\r\nMy very self but mostly my antipodes;\r\nBut having waved the heavy artillery to fire\r\nI must hammer on to an end.\r\n\r\nTo-night, dear,\r\nLet\'s forget all that, that and the war,\r\nAnd enisle ourselves a little beyond time,\r\nYou with this Irish whiskey, I with red wine\r\nWhile the stars go over the sleepless ocean,\r\nAnd sometime after midnight I\'ll pluck you a wreath\r\nOf chosen ones; we\'ll talk about love and death,\r\nRock-solid themes, old and deep as the sea,\r\nAdmit nothing more timely, nothing less real\r\nWhile the stars go over the timeless ocean,\r\nAnd when they vanish we\'ll have spent the night well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkunk Hour\r\nby Robert Lowell\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\nNautilus Island\'s hermit\r\nheiress still lives through winter in her Spartan cottage;\r\nher sheep still graze above the sea.\r\nHer son\'s a bishop.

All times I have enjoyed\r\nGreatly, have suffered greatly, both with those\r\nThat loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\r\nThrough scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\nVext the dim sea.  I am become a name;\r\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart.\r\nMuch have I seen and knowncities of men\r\nAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\nMyself not least, but honored of them all,\r\nAnd drunk delight of battle with my peers,\r\nFar on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\r\nI am a part of all that I have met;\r\nYet all experience is an arch wherethrough\r\nGleams that untraveled world whose margin fades\r\nFor ever and for ever when I move.\r\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\r\nTo rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\r\nAs though to breathe were life! Life piled on life\r\nWere all too little, and of one to me\r\nLittle remains; but every hour is saved\r\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\r\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\r\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\r\nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire\r\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\r\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\r\n This is my son, mine own Telemachus,\r\nTo whom I leave the scepter and the isle,\r\nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfill\r\nThis labor, by slow prudence to make mild\r\nA rugged people, and through soft degrees\r\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\r\nMost blameless is he, centered in the sphere\r\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\r\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\r\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\r\nWhen I am gone.  He works his work, I mine.\r\n There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\r\nThere gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\r\nSouls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,\r\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\r\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\r\nFree hearts, free foreheadsyou and I are old;\r\nOld age hath yet his honor and his toil.\r\nDeath closes all; but something ere the end,\r\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\r\nNot unbecoming men that strove with gods.\r\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\r\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\r\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\r\n\'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\r\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\r\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\r\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\r\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\r\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\r\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\r\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\r\nThough much is taken, much abides; and though\r\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\r\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,\r\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\r\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\r\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTulips\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.\r\nLook how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.\r\nI am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly\r\nAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.\r\nI am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.\r\nI have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses\r\nAnd my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.\r\n\r\nThey have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff\r\nLike an eye between two white lids that will not shut.\r\nStupid pupil, it has to take everything in.\r\nThe nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,\r\nThey pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,\r\nDoing things with their hands, one just the same as another,\r\nSo it is impossible to tell how many there are.\r\n\r\nMy body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water\r\nTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.\r\nThey bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.\r\nNow I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\r\nMy patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,\r\nMy husband and child smiling out of the family photo;\r\nTheir smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.\r\n\r\nI have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat\r\nstubbornly hanging on to my name and address.\r\nThey have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.\r\nScared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley\r\nI watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books\r\nSink out of sight, and the water went over my head.\r\nI am a nun now, I have never been so pure.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t want any flowers, I only wanted\r\nTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.\r\nHow free it is, you have no idea how free\r\nThe peacefulness is so big it dazes you,\r\nAnd it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.\r\nIt is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them\r\nShutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.\r\n\r\nThe tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.\r\nEven through the gift paper I could hear them breathe\r\nLightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.\r\nTheir redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.\r\nThey are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,\r\nUpsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,\r\nA dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.\r\n\r\nNobody watched me before, now I am watched.\r\nThe tulips turn to me, and the window behind me\r\nWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,\r\nAnd I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow\r\nBetween the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,\r\nAnd I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.\r\nThe vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\r\n\r\nBefore they came the air was calm enough,\r\nComing and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.\r\nThen the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.\r\nNow the air snags and eddies round them the way a river\r\nSnags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.\r\nThey concentrate my attention, that was happy\r\nPlaying and resting without committing itself.\r\n\r\nThe walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.\r\nThe tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;\r\nThey are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,\r\nAnd I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes\r\nIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.\r\nThe water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,\r\nAnd comes from a country far away as health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, Andrew Marvell\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nAnd here face down beneath the sun\r\nAnd here upon earth\'s noonward height\r\nTo feel the always coming on\r\nThe always rising of the night:\r\n\r\nTo feel creep up the curving east\r\nThe earthy chill of dusk and slow\r\nUpon those under lands the vast\r\nAnd ever climbing shadow grow\r\n\r\nAnd strange at Ecbatan the trees\r\nTake leaf by leaf the evening strange\r\nThe flooding dark about their knees\r\nThe mountains over Persia change\r\n\r\nAnd now at Kermanshah the gate\r\nDark empty and the withered grass\r\nAnd through the twilight now the late\r\nFew travelers in the westward pass\r\n\r\nAnd Baghdad darken and the bridge\r\nAcross the silent river gone\r\nAnd through Arabia the edge\r\nOf evening widen and steal on\r\n\r\nAnd deepen on Palmyra\'s street\r\nThe wheel rut in the ruined stone\r\nAnd Lebanon fade out and Crete\r\nhigh through the clouds and overblown\r\n\r\nAnd over Sicily the air\r\nStill flashing with the landward gulls\r\nAnd loom and slowly disappear\r\nThe sails above the shadowy hulls\r\n\r\nAnd Spain go under and the shore\r\nOf Africa the gilded sand\r\nAnd evening vanish and no more\r\nThe low pale light across that land\r\n\r\nNor now the long light on the sea:\r\nAnd here face downward in the sun\r\nTo feel how swift how secretly\r\nThe shadow of the night comes on...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorial Rain\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nfor Kenneth MacLeish, 1894-1918\r\n\r\nAmbassador Puser the ambassador\r\nReminds himself in French, felicitous tongue,\r\nWhat these (young men no longer) lie here for\r\nIn rows that once, and somewhere else, were young\r\n\r\nAll night in Brussels the wind had tugged at my door:\r\nI had heard the wind at my door and the trees strung\r\nTaut, and to me who had never been before\r\nIn that country it was a strange wind, blowing\r\nSteadily, stiffening the walls, the floor,\r\nThe roof of my room. I had not slept for knowing\r\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\r\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the wind\'s flowing\r\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\r\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\r\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\r\nListening.\r\n\r\nReflects that these enjoy\r\nTheir country\'s gratitude, that deep repose,\r\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\r\nThat rest, that sleep\r\n\r\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\r\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\r\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\r\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\r\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\r\nI felt him waiting.\r\n\r\nIndicates the flag\r\nWhich (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain\r\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\r\nHave made America\r\n\r\nIn the ripe grain\r\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\r\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\r\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\r\nWaitinglistening\r\n\r\nDedicates to them\r\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\r\nA Grateful country\r\n\r\nUnder the dry grass stem\r\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\r\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\r\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\r\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\r\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\r\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\r\n\r\nThe living scatter, they run into houses, the wind\r\nIs trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again\r\nTrampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned\r\nSpurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,\r\nSeeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping\r\nBetween cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:\r\nThe earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,\r\nHe rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I Grew Older\r\n\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nIt was a long time ago.\r\nI have almost forgotten my dream.\r\nBut it was there then,\r\nIn front of me,\r\nBright like a sun\r\nMy dream.\r\nAnd then the wall rose,\r\nRose slowly,\r\nSlowly,\r\nBetween me and my dream.\r\nRose until it touched the sky\r\nThe wall.\r\nShadow.\r\nI am black.\r\nI lie down in the shadow.\r\nNo longer the light of my dream before me,\r\nAbove me.\r\nOnly the thick wall.\r\nOnly the shadow.\r\nMy hands!\r\nMy dark hands!\r\nBreak through the wall!\r\nFind my dream!\r\nHelp me to shatter this darkness,\r\nTo smash this night,\r\nTo break this shadow\r\nInto a thousand lights of sun,\r\nInto a thousand whirling dreams\r\nOf sun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen We Two Parted\r\nby George Gordon, Lord \r\nByron\r\n\r\nWhen we two parted\r\nIn silence and tears,\r\nHalf broken-hearted\r\nTo sever for years,\r\nPale grew thy cheek and cold,\r\nColder thy kiss;\r\nTruly that hour foretold\r\nSorrow to this.\r\n\r\nThe dew of the morning\r\nSunk chill on my brow\r\nIt felt like the warning\r\nOf what I feel now.\r\n\r\nThy vows are all broken,\r\nAnd light is thy fame;\r\nI hear thy name spoken,\r\nAnd share in its shame.\r\n\r\nThey name thee before me,\r\nA knell to mine ear;\r\nA shudder comes o\'er me\r\nWhy wert thou so dear?\r\nThey know not I knew thee,\r\nWho knew thee too well\r\nLong, long shall I rue thee,\r\nTo deeply to tell.\r\n\r\nIn secret we met\r\nIn silence I grieve,\r\nThat thy heart could forget,\r\nThy spirit deceive.\r\n\r\nIf I should meet thee\r\nAfter long years,\r\nHow should I greet thee?\r\nWith silence and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners \r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nValentine\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\nToo high, too high to pluck \r\nMy heart shall swing. \r\nA fruit no bee shall suck, \r\nNo wasp shall sting.\r\n\r\nIf on some night of cold \r\nIt falls to ground \r\nIn apple-leaves of gold \r\nI\'ll wrap it round.\r\n\r\nAnd I shall seal it up \r\nWith spice and salt, \r\nIn a carven silver cup, \r\nIn a deep vault. \r\n\r\nBefore my eyes are blind \r\nAnd my lips mute, \r\nI must eat core and rind \r\nOf that same fruit. \r\n\r\nBefore my heart is dust \r\nAt the end of all, \r\nEat it I must, I must \r\nWere it bitter gall. \r\nBut I shall keep it sweet \r\nBy some strange art; \r\nWild honey I shall eat \r\nWhen I eat my heart. \r\n\r\nO honey cool and chaste \r\nAs clover\'s breath! \r\nSweet Heaven I shall taste \r\nBefore my death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWanting to Die\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nSince you ask, most days I cannot remember.\r\nI walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.\r\nThen the almost unnameable lust returns.\r\n\r\nEven then I have nothing against life.\r\nI know well the grass blades you mention,\r\nthe furniture you have placed under the sun.\r\n\r\nBut suicides have a special language.\r\nLike carpenters they want to know which tools.\r\nThey never ask why build.\r\n\r\nTwice I have so simply declared myself,\r\nhave possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,\r\nhave taken on his craft, his magic.\r\n\r\nIn this way, heavy and thoughtful,\r\nwarmer than oil or water,\r\nI have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.\r\n\r\nI did not think of my body at needle point.\r\nEven the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.\r\nSuicides have already betrayed the body.\r\n\r\nStill-born, they don\'t always die,\r\nbut dazzled, they can\'t forget a drug so sweet\r\nthat even children would look on and smile.\r\n\r\nTo thrust all that life under your tongue!\r\nthat, all by itself, becomes a passion.\r\nDeath\'s a sad bone; bruised, you\'d say,\r\n\r\nand yet she waits for me, year after year,\r\nto so delicately undo an old wound,\r\nto empty my breath from its bad prison.\r\n\r\nBalanced there, suicides sometimes meet,\r\nraging at the fruit a pumped-up moon,\r\nleaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,\r\n\r\nleaving the page of the book carelessly open,\r\nsomething unsaid, the phone off the hook\r\nand the love whatever it was, an infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Writer\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\nIn her room at the prow of the house\r\nWhere light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,\r\nMy daughter is writing a story.\r\n\r\nI pause in the stairwell, hearing\r\nFrom her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys\r\nLike a chain hauled over a gunwale.\r\n\r\nYoung as she is, the stuff\r\nOf her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:\r\nI wish her a lucky passage.\r\n\r\nBut now it is she who pauses,\r\nAs if to reject my thought and its easy figure.\r\nA stillness greatens, in which\r\n\r\nThe whole house seems to be thinking,\r\nAnd then she is at it again with a bunched clamor\r\nOf strokes, and again is silent.\r\n\r\nI remember the dazed starling\r\nWhich was trapped in that very room, two years ago;\r\nHow we stole in, lifted a sash\r\n\r\nAnd retreated, not to affright it;\r\nAnd how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,\r\nWe watched the sleek, wild, dark\r\n\r\nAnd iridescent creature\r\nBatter against the brilliance, drop like a glove\r\nTo the hard floor, or the desk-top,\r\n\r\nAnd wait then, humped and bloody,\r\nFor the wits to try it again; and how our spirits\r\nRose when, suddenly sure,\r\n\r\nIt lifted off from a chair-back,\r\nBeating a smooth course for the right window\r\nAnd clearing the sill of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is always a matter, my darling,\r\nOf life or death, as I had forgotten.
