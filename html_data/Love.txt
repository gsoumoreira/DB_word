Selecting the \r\nbest love poems of all time has been a \r\nmatter of personal taste and fancy. If you disagree with my choices, please feel \r\nfree to compile your own, but you may find poems here that \r\nmerit your consideration. Although most of the poems on this page are fairly \r\nrecent, I have included modernized translations of ancient classics such as \r\nWulf and Eadwacer and William Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue \r\nbecause many readers may not have read them, and that\'s a shame. I have also \r\nincluded translations of some of my favorite Urdu love poems, which are notable \r\nfor their highly romantic images and evocative metaphors.\r\n\r\nWho are the greatest love poets of the English language? In my opinion the ten best love poets \r\nare Louise Bogan, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Burns, Hart Crane, e. e. cummings, \r\nEmily Dickinson, John Donne, Ernest Dowson, John Keats, William Shakespeare and William Butler Yeats. High honorable \r\nmentions go to William Blake, Lord Byron, Leonard Cohen, Robert Frost, Robert Herrick, Ben \r\nJonson, Christopher Marlowe, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sylvia Plath, Christina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, \r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley \r\nand Walt Whitman. Great \r\nlove poets in other languages include Dante, Kahlil Gibran, Czeslaw Milosz, \r\nPablo Neruda, Ovid, Petrarch, Rumi, \r\nKing Solomon and Rabindranath Tagore. Who is the greatest love poet of \r\nall time? My vote goes to the first great lyric poet we know by name, Sappho of \r\nLesbos, whose erotic poems gave us the terms sapphic and lesbian.\r\n\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael \r\nR. Burch\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this page reflects one person\'s opinion, for whatever \r\nthat\'s worth ...\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to give someone special an out-of-the ordinary Valentine\'s Day \r\npresent, here\'s a love poem of mine that you\'re free to share:\r\n\r\nPassionate One\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLove of my life,\r\nlight of my morning\r\narise, brightly dawning,\r\nfor you are my sun. \r\n\r\nGive me of heaven\r\nboth manna and leaven\r\ndesirous Presence,\r\nPassionate One.\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like a wider range of love poems to choose from, you\'re welcome to \r\nbrowse this page of love poems, which are free for noncommercial use:\r\n\r\nLove Poems for the Ages.\r\n\r\nHere are two love poems by the great Persian poet Rumi:\r\n\r\nWhen I am with you, we stay up all night. \r\nWhen you\'re not here, I can\'t go to sleep. \r\nPraise God for these two insomnias! \r\nAnd the difference between them.\r\nJalaluddin Rumi, translation by Coleman Barks\r\n\r\nCome to the orchard in Spring. \r\nThere is light and wine, and sweethearts \r\nIn the pomegranate flowers. \r\nIf you do not come, these do not matter. \r\nIf you do come, these do not matter.\r\nJalaluddin Rumi, translation by Coleman Barks\r\n\r\nNow here, without further ado, are my top ten love poems of all time, recently \r\nexpanded to the top 25 love poems, with a few ties, followed by a number of high \r\nhonorable mentions ...\r\n\r\n#25  Sappho, fragment 42\r\nloose\r\ntranslation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos (circa 630-570 BC) is perhaps the first great female poet still known to us today, \r\nand she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. \r\nShe is so revered for her erotic love poetry that we get our terms sapphic and lesbian from her name \r\nand island of residence. And as you can see from the utterly stellar epigram above, \r\nshe remains a timeless treasure.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 58\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPain\r\ndrains\r\nme\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nlast\r\ndrop\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \r\nunrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne helped \r\nmake her almost as famous as he was in pre-independence Ireland. The moving poem below is Yeats\' \r\nloose translation of a Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \r\nlife in her later years, tending a fire that symbolizes the banked flames of a \r\nwaning love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#24  When You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#23 Requiescat\r\nby \r\nOscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde\'s exquisitely lovely Requiescat is a wonderfully moving poem, and \r\none of the best elegies in the English language. Wilde wrote the poem for his \r\nsister Isola, who died at age ten when he was twelve. The poem \r\nwas written, or finished, seven years later, when Oscar Wilde was around age \r\nnineteen. The doctor who attended Isola in her illness described her as the \r\nmost gifted and lovable child he had ever seen. Ossie was at the \r\ntime an affectionate, gentle, retiring, dreamy boy whose \r\nlonely and inconsolable grief sought vent in long and frequent visits to his \r\nsister\'s grave in the village cemetery. \r\n\r\n#22  How Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\nElizabeth Barrett married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. Her best-known book today \r\nis Sonnets from the Portuguese. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElinor Wylie was famous during her life almost as much for her ethereal beauty \r\nand personality as for her melodious, sensuous poetry.\r\n\r\n#21  Valentine\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\nToo high, too high to pluck \r\nMy heart shall swing. \r\nA fruit no bee shall suck, \r\nNo wasp shall sting.\r\n\r\nIf on some night of cold \r\nIt falls to ground \r\nIn apple-leaves of gold \r\nIll wrap it round.\r\n\r\nAnd I shall seal it up \r\nWith spice and salt, \r\nIn a carven silver cup, \r\nIn a deep vault. \r\n\r\nBefore my eyes are blind \r\nAnd my lips mute, \r\nI must eat core and rind \r\nOf that same fruit. \r\n\r\nBefore my heart is dust \r\nAt the end of all, \r\nEat it I must, I must \r\nWere it bitter gall.\r\n\r\nBut I shall keep it sweet \r\nBy some strange art; \r\nWild honey I shall eat \r\nWhen I eat my heart. \r\n\r\nO honey cool and chaste \r\nAs clovers breath! \r\nSweet Heaven I shall taste \r\nBefore my death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first and best of the modern confessional poets. She \r\nwon a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\r\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \r\npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life.\r\n\r\n#20  Mystic\r\nby Sylvia Plath \r\n\r\nThe air is a mill of hooks\r\nQuestions without answer,\r\nGlittering and drunk as flies\r\nWhose kiss stings unbearably\r\nIn the fetid wombs of black air under pines in summer.\r\n\r\nI remember\r\nThe dead smell of sun on wood cabins,\r\nThe stiffness of sails, the long salt winding sheets.\r\nOnce one has seen God, what is the remedy?\r\nOnce one has been seized up\r\n\r\nWithout a part left over,\r\nNot a toe, not a finger, and used,\r\nUsed utterly, in the sun\'s conflagration, the stains\r\nThat lengthen from ancient cathedrals\r\nWhat is the remedy?\r\n\r\nThe pill of the Communion tablet,\r\nThe walking beside still water? Memory?\r\nOr picking up the bright pieces\r\nOf Christ in the faces of rodents,\r\nThe tame flower-nibblers, the ones\r\n\r\nWhose hopes are so low they are comfortable\r\nThe humpback in his small, washed cottage\r\nUnder the spokes of the clematis.\r\nIs there no great love, only tenderness?\r\nDoes the sea\r\n\r\nRemember the walker upon it?\r\nMeaning leaks from the molecules.\r\nThe chimneys of the city breathe, the window sweats,\r\nThe children leap in their cots.\r\nThe sun blooms, it is a geranium.\r\n\r\nThe heart has not stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \r\nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \r\nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \r\nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \r\nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \r\nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \r\nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \r\ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) \r\n\r\n#19  I, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\r\nI shall remember you with love, or season\r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \r\npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \r\nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \r\nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \r\nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \r\nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, \r\nmasturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. The poem below is \r\nabout the love of the living for the dead, dedicated to her departed parents. \r\n\r\n\r\n#18  The Truth the Dead Know\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\r\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\r\n\r\nGone, I say and walk from church,\r\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\r\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\r\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\r\n\r\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\r\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\r\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\r\nand we touch. In another country people die.\r\n\r\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\r\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\r\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\r\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\r\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\r\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\r\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\r\n\r\n\r\n#17  \r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift is one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. \r\nIt\'s a wonderfully touching, moving poem about love and empathy for all life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#16  Rondel\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting poem, not only because it\'s sad and lovely, but because \r\nthe poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne! And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to English \r\npoetry, adapting it from the French rondeau. You can learn more about \r\nKevin Roberts and read more of his poems by clicking his hyperlinked name. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#16  On the Beach at Fontana\r\nby James Joyce\r\n\r\nWind whines and whines the shingle,\r\nThe crazy pierstakes groan;\r\nA senile sea numbers each single\r\nSlimesilvered stone.\r\n\r\nFrom whining wind and colder\r\nGrey sea I wrap him warm\r\nAnd touch his trembling fineboned shoulder\r\nAnd boyish arm.\r\n\r\nAround us fear, descending,\r\nDarkness of fear above;\r\nAnd in my heart how deep unending\r\nAche of love!\r\n\r\nJames Joyce is better known today as a novelist, but this is a fine and moving \r\npoem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#16  Wulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous \r\nAnglo-Saxon poem, circa 960-990 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy people pursue him like crippled prey.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; we\'re on another.\r\nHis island is fast, surrounded by fens.\r\nThere are fierce curs on this island;\r\nthey\'ll rip apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I wept, disconsolate,\r\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? Watchdog! A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sunder what was never one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer has been one of my favorite poems since the first time I \r\nread it. In fact, I loved the poem so much that I ended \r\nup translating it myself; it was my first translation. Wulf and Eadwacer is one of the oldest poems in the English language, and \r\nquite possibly the first extant poem by a female English \r\npoet. It is also one of the first English poems to employ a refrain, and its closing metaphor of a loveless relationship being like a \r\nsong in which two voices never harmonized remains one of the strongest in all literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#16  After Paradise \r\nby Czeslaw Milosz\r\n\r\nDon\'t run any more. Quiet. How softly it rains\r\nOn the roofs of the city. How perfect\r\nAll things are. Now, for the two of you\r\nWaking up in a royal bed by a garret window.\r\nFor a man and a woman. For one plant divided\r\nInto masculine and feminine which longed for each other.\r\nYes, this is my gift to you. Above ashes\r\nOn a bitter, bitter earth. Above the subterranean\r\nEcho of clamorings and vows. So that now at dawn\r\nYou must be attentive: the tilt of a head,\r\nA hand with a comb, two faces in a mirror\r\nAre only forever once, even if unremembered,\r\nSo that you watch what it is, though it fades away,\r\nAnd are grateful every moment for your being.\r\nLet that little park with greenish marble busts\r\nIn the pearl-gray light, under a summer drizzle,\r\nRemain as it was when you opened the gate.\r\nAnd the street of tall peeling porticos\r\nWhich this love of yours suddenly transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#16  \r\nLast Night \r\nby Faiz Ahmed Faiz\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\nLast night, your memory stole into my heart\r\nas spring sweeps uninvited into barren gardens,\r\nas morning breezes reinvigorate dormant deserts,\r\nas a patient suddenly feels better, for no apparent reason ...\r\n\r\n#16  \r\nStrange Currents\r\nby Amir Khusrow\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\nO Khusrow, the river of love\r\nexhibits strange tides\r\nthe one who would swim in it invariably drowns,\r\nwhile the one who surrenders, survives. \r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most notorious married \r\ncouple of their era. He was a dashing romantic poet and heretic who wrote a \r\ntract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled from Oxford. He also \r\nwrote in favor of nonviolence and against monarchies, \r\nimperialism and war. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \r\nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \r\nGodwin. In 1814, at age seventeen, she \r\nbecame romantically involved with Percy Shelley, who was married at the time but \r\nthreatened to commit suicide if she spurned his advances. They spent time \r\ntogether in France and Switzerland; when they returned, Mary was pregnant. Percy\'s wife Harriet, who was also pregnant, committed suicide in 1816; Percy \r\nand Mary married soon thereafter. The same year they spent the summer with Lord \r\nByron. It was at this time that Mary conceived the story that became her famous \r\ngothic novel Frankenstein. In 1822, Percy drowned at sea at age thirty. Who knows what he would \r\nhave accomplished if he had lived longer, but he is still considered to be one \r\nof the greatest English poets. Here is one especially lovely example of his \r\nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#15  Music When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n\r\n#14 A Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was one of the great early Romantics, perhaps a forerunner of both \r\nShelley and Clare. \r\nDespite the fact that he wrote in a Scots-English dialect, he still reads well today. \r\nHe is, of course, most famous for his nostalgic drinking song Auld Lang Syne. \r\nWhen Bob Dylan was asked to name the work of art that had the greatest impact on \r\nhis own artistic life, he named the poem above.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt has been credited with introducing the \r\nPetrarchan sonnet into the English language. His father, Henry Wyatt, had been one of Henry \r\nVII\'s Privy Councilors, and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII came to \r\nthe throne in 1509. Thomas Wyatt followed his father to court. But it seems the \r\nyoung poet may have fallen in love with the kings mistress. Many legends and \r\nconjectures suggest that an unhappily married Wyatt had a relationship with \r\nAnne Boleyn. Their acquaintance is certain, but whether or not the two \r\nactually shared a romantic relationship remains unknown. But in his poetry, Wyatt called \r\nhis mistress Anna, and sometimes embedded pieces of information that seem to correspond with \r\nher life. For instance, this poem might well have been written \r\nabout the Kings claim on Anne Boleyn: \r\n\r\n#13   Whoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,\r\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am,\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. So perhaps after her betrothal to Henry, religious vows also \r\nentered into the picture, and left Wyatt out.\r\n\r\n\r\n#12   They Flee from Me\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n#11   Sweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is another of my favorite poems from the early days of English poetry. I chose to \r\ntranslate it myself, to make it more accessible to modern readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n#11   Les Bijoux (The Jewels)\r\nby Charles Baudelaire\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy lover nude and knowing my heart\'s whims\r\nWore nothing more than a few bright-flashing gems;\r\nHer art was saving men despite their sins\r\nShe ruled like harem girls crowned with diadems! \r\n\r\nShe danced for me with a gay but mocking air,\r\nMy world of stone and metal sparking bright;\r\nI discovered in her the rapture of everything fair\r\nNay, an excess of joy where the spirit and flesh unite! \r\n\r\nNaked she lay and offered herself to me,\r\nParting her legs and smiling receptively,\r\nAs gentle and yet profound as the rising sea\r\nTill her surging tide encountered my cliff, abruptly. \r\n\r\nA tigress tamed, her eyes met mine, intent ...\r\nIntent on lust, content to purr and please!\r\nHer breath, both languid and lascivious, lent \r\nAn odd charm to her metamorphoses. \r\n\r\nHer limbs, her loins, her abdomen, her thighs,\r\nOiled alabaster, sinuous as a swan,\r\nWrithed pale before my calm clairvoyant eyes;\r\nLike clustered grapes her breasts and belly shone. \r\n\r\nSkilled in more spells than evil imps can muster,\r\nTo break the peace which had possessed my heart,\r\nShe flashed her crystal rocks hypnotic luster\r\nTill my quietude was shattered, blown apart. \r\n\r\nHer waist awrithe, her breasts enormously \r\nOut-thrust, and yet ... and yet, somehow, still coy ...\r\nAs if stout haunches of Antiope \r\nHad been grafted to a boy ... \r\n\r\nThe room grew dark, the lamp had flickered out.\r\nMute firelight, alone, lit each glowing stud;\r\nEach time the fire sighed, as if in doubt,\r\nIt steeped her pale, rouged flesh in pools of blood.\r\n\r\nI think Charles Baudelaire\'s poem The Jewels captures much of the chaos, \r\nconfusion and mystery of love and sex. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#10  La Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nAlong with Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot helped create modern free verse. This poem \r\ndemonstrates his his remarkable talents. While Eliot was a sophisticated, urbane \r\npoet, his main theme was human love, and he often comes across as a somewhat \r\nnerdy, disillusioned romantic. \r\n\r\n\r\n#9  To Earthward by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to imagine a better-written love poem than Robert Frost\'s To \r\nEarthward, and yet we still have five higher spots to go ...\r\n\r\n\r\n#8  Song For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan\'s magnificent Song for the Last Act is an absolutely wonderful \r\npoem about love toward the end of one\'s life, or a couple\'s lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n#7  Bread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nConrad Aiken, in his best poems, rivals Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as masters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s Bread and \r\nMusic is one of my very favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\r\n\r\n#6  Piano \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n#5  \r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n\r\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson\'s influence on T. S. Eliot is obvious, and anyone who reads his best poems can easily understand the attraction. Other writers \r\nunabashedly borrowed phrases from Dowson: gone with the wind, the days of wine and roses, hollow \r\nlands, etc. The best poets write memorable lines, and Dowson\'s best poems are full of memorable lines. Several of his poems can be found \r\non the Masters page of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n#4  Lullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstasy.\r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\nAuden\'s Lullaby is one of the truly great poems in the English language. His elegy to William Butler Yeats is another.\r\n\r\n#3  Go, Lovely Rose\r\nby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose is a picture-perfect carpe diem (seize the day) poem. \r\nOther famous love poems that advise virgins to hop into bed with the poet \r\ninclude To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell, To the Virgins, to Make Much \r\nof Time and To Daffodils by Robert Herrick, Sweet Rose of \r\nVirtue by William Dunbar and When I Was One-and-Twenty by \r\nA. E. Housman. But in my opinion, this poem is just as clever, and more beautiful than \r\nany of its competitors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#2   Wild Nights\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nWild nightsWild nights!\r\nWere I with thee\r\nWild nights should be\r\nOur luxury!\r\n\r\nFutilethe winds\r\nTo a Heart in port\r\nDone with the Compass\r\nDone with the Chart!\r\n\r\nRowing in Eden\r\nAhthe Sea!\r\nMight I but moortonight\r\nIn thee!\r\n\r\n\r\n#2  Cradle Song by William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n  \r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n  \r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n  \r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\n Auden\'s Lullaby was written from one adult to another. Blake\'s \r\nCradle Song is a lullaby written by an adult to a sleeping baby. Blake was \r\nmarried but never had children, as far as we know, yet his love and compassion \r\nfor the nameless sleeping baby are wonderfully evident in this very moving poem.\r\nI think Dickinson\'s Wild Nights and Blake\'s Cradle Song demonstrate the vast \r\nrange of love poety.\r\n\r\n\r\n#1  \r\nVoyages\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAbove the fresh ruffles of the surf\r\nBright striped urchins flay each other with sand. \r\n\r\nThey have contrived a conquest for shell shucks, \r\n\r\nAnd their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed \r\n\r\nGaily digging and scattering.\r\n\r\nAnd in answer to their treble interjections \r\n\r\nThe sun beats lightning on the waves,\r\nThe waves fold thunder on the sand;\r\nAnd could they hear me I would tell them: \r\n\r\n\r\nO brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,\r\nFondle your shells and sticks, bleached\r\nBy time and the elements; but there is a line \r\n\r\nYou must not cross nor ever trust beyond it \r\n\r\nSpry cordage of your bodies to caresses\r\nToo lichen-faithful from too wide a breast. \r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea is cruel.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAnd yet this great wink of eternity,\r\nOf rimless floods, unfettered leewardings, \r\n\r\nSamite sheeted and processioned where\r\nHer undinal vast belly moonward bends,\r\nLaughing the wrapt inflections of our love; \r\n\r\n\r\nTake this Sea, whose diapason knells\r\nOn scrolls of silver snowy sentences,\r\nThe sceptred terror of whose sessions rends \r\n\r\nAs her demeanors motion well or ill,\r\nAll but the pieties of lovers hands.\r\n\r\nAnd onward, as bells off San Salvador\r\nSalute the crocus lustres of the stars,\r\nIn these poinsettia meadows of her tides, \r\n\r\nAdagios of islands, O my Prodigal,\r\nComplete the dark confessions her veins spell. \r\n\r\n\r\nMark how her turning shoulders wind the hours, \r\n\r\nAnd hasten while her penniless rich palms \r\n\r\nPass superscription of bent foam and wave, \r\n\r\nHasten, while they are true,sleep, death, desire, \r\n\r\nClose round one instant in one floating flower. \r\n\r\n\r\nBind us in time, O Seasons clear, and awe. \r\n\r\nO minstrel galleons of Carib fire,\r\nBequeath us to no earthly shore until\r\nIs answered in the vortex of our grave\r\nThe seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise. \r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nInfinite consanguinity it bears\r\nThis tendered theme of you that light\r\nRetrieves from sea plains where the sky\r\nResigns a breast that every wave enthrones; \r\n\r\nWhile ribboned water lanes I wind\r\nAre laved and scattered with no stroke\r\nWide from your side, whereto this hour\r\nThe sea lifts, also, reliquary hands.\r\n\r\nAnd so, admitted through black swollen gates\r\nThat must arrest all distance otherwise,\r\nPast whirling pillars and lithe pediments,\r\nLight wrestling there incessantly with light,\r\nStar kissing star through wave on wave unto\r\nYour body rocking!\r\nand where death, if shed,\r\nPresumes no carnage, but this single change,\r\nUpon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn\r\nThe silken skilled transmemberment of song;\r\n\r\nPermit me voyage, love, into your hands ...\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhose counted smile of hours and days, suppose\r\nI know as spectrum of the sea and pledge\r\nVastly now parting gulf on gulf of wings\r\nWhose circles bridge, I know, (from palms to the severe \r\n\r\nChilled albatrosss white immutability)\r\nNo stream of greater love advancing now\r\nThan, singing, this mortality alone\r\nThrough clay aflow immortally to you.\r\n\r\nAll fragrance irrefragably, and claim\r\nMadly meeting logically in this hour\r\nAnd region that is ours to wreathe again,\r\nPortending eyes and lips and making told\r\nThe chancel port and portion of our June\r\n\r\nShall they not stem and close in our own steps\r\nBright staves of flowers and quills today as I\r\nMust first be lost in fatal tides to tell?\r\n\r\nIn signature of the incarnate word\r\nThe harbor shoulders to resign in mingling\r\nMutual blood, transpiring as foreknown\r\nAnd widening noon within your breast for gathering\r\nAll bright insinuations that my years have caught\r\nFor islands where must lead inviolably\r\nBlue latitudes and levels of your eyes,\r\n\r\nIn this expectant, still exclaim receive\r\nThe secret oar and petals of all love.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMeticulous, past midnight in clear rime,\r\nInfrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast\r\nTogether in one merciless white blade\r\nThe bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.\r\n\r\nAs if too brittle or too clear to touch!\r\nThe cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,\r\nAlready hang, shred ends from remembered stars.\r\nOne frozen trackless smile ... What words\r\nCan strangle this deaf moonlight? For we\r\n\r\nAre overtaken. Now no cry, no sword\r\nCan fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,\r\nSlow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved\r\nAnd changed ... Theres\r\n\r\nNothing like this in the world, you say,\r\nKnowing I cannot touch your hand and look\r\nToo, into that godless cleft of sky\r\nWhere nothing turns but dead sands flashing.\r\n\r\nAnd never to quite understand! No,\r\nIn all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed\r\nNothing so flagless as this piracy.\r\n\r\nBut now\r\nDraw in your head, alone and too tall here.\r\nYour eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;\r\nYour breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:\r\nDraw in your head and sleep the long way home.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhere icy and bright dungeons lift\r\nOf swimmers their lost morning eyes,\r\nAnd ocean rivers, churning, shift\r\nGreen borders under stranger skies,\r\n\r\nSteadily as a shell secretes\r\nIts beating leagues of monotone,\r\nOr as many waters trough the suns\r\nRed kelson past the capes wet stone;\r\n\r\nO rivers mingling toward the sky\r\nAnd harbor of the phoenix breast\r\nMy eyes pressed black against the prow,\r\nThy derelict and blinded guest\r\n\r\nWaiting, afire, what name, unspoke,\r\nI cannot claim: let thy waves rear\r\nMore savage than the death of kings,\r\nSome splintered garland for the seer.\r\n\r\nBeyond siroccos harvesting\r\nThe solstice thunders, crept away,\r\nLike a cliff swinging or a sail\r\nFlung into Aprils inmost day\r\n\r\nCreations blithe and petalled word\r\nTo the lounged goddess when she rose\r\nConceding dialogue with eyes\r\nThat smile unsearchable repose\r\n\r\nStill fervid covenant, Belle Isle,\r\nUnfolded floating dais before\r\nWhich rainbows twine continual hair\r\nBelle Isle, white echo of the oar!\r\n\r\nThe imaged Word, it is, that holds\r\nHushed willows anchored in its glow.\r\nIt is the unbetrayable reply\r\nWhose accent no farewell can know.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Hart Crane\'s Voyages is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. Hart Crane was an uneven poet who \r\nsometimes borders on being unreadable, but in his best poems, he is a wonder. \r\nOther poems of his such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are my high honorable mentions ...\r\n\r\nExcerpt from The Song of Songs\r\nattributed to King Solomon\r\n\r\nI am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\nAs the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\nAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.\r\nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\nHe brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.\r\nStay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.\r\nHis left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.\r\nI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,\r\nand by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.\r\n\r\nWho\'d have thought to look for erotic poetry in the Bible? But the Song of \r\nSongs (also known as the Song of Solomon) remains one of the sexiest poems of \r\nall time. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n\r\nby Ann Drysdale\r\n\r\nThe print of a bare foot, the second toe\r\nA little longer than the one which is\r\nTraditionally designated great.\r\nPraxiteles would have admired it.\r\n\r\nYou must have left in haste; your last wet step\r\nBefore boarding your suit and setting sail,\r\nOutlined in talcum on the bathroom floor\r\nMocks your habitual fastidiousness.\r\n\r\nThere is no tide here to obliterate\r\nYour oversight.

We were in a room\r\nWith walls as warm as anybodys breath,\r\nAnd music wove us on its patterning loom,\r\nThe complicated loom of life and death.\r\nYour hands moved over my face like small clouds.\r\n(Rain fell into a river and sank, somewhere.)\r\nI moved among your fingers, brushed by the small crowds\r\nOf them, feeling myself known, everywhere,\r\nAnd in that desperate country so far from here,\r\nI heard you say my name over and over,\r\nYour voice threading its way into my ear.\r\nI will spend my days working to discover\r\nThe pattern and its meaning, what you meant,\r\nWhat has been raveled and what has been rent.\r\n\r\nA Quoi Bon Dire (What Good is there to Say)\r\nby\r\nCharlotte Mew\r\n\r\nSeventeen years ago you said\r\nSomething that sounded like Good-bye;\r\nAnd everybody thinks that you are dead,\r\nBut I.\r\n\r\nSo I, as I grow stiff and cold\r\nTo this and that say Good-bye too;\r\nAnd everybody sees that I am old\r\nBut you.\r\n\r\nAnd one fine morning in a sunny lane\r\nSome boy and girl will meet and kiss and swear\r\nThat nobody can love their way again\r\nWhile over there\r\nYou will have smiled, I shall have tossed your hair.\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\n    I sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\n    Not so much honouring thee,\r\n    As giving it a hope, that there\r\n    It could not withered be.\r\n    But thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\n    And sent\'st back to me:\r\n    Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\n    Not of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\nDistant light\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\n\r\nHarsh and cold\r\nautumn holds to it our naked trees:\r\nIf only you would free, at least, the sparrows\r\nfrom the tips of your fingers\r\nand release a smile, a small smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned cry I see.\r\nSing! Can we sing\r\nas if we were light, hand in hand\r\nsheltered in shade, under a strong sun?\r\nWill you remain, this way\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than necessary, and \r\nquiet?\r\nDarkness intensifies\r\nand the distant light is our only consolation \r\nthat one, which from the beginning\r\nhas, little by little, been flickering\r\nand is now about to go out.\r\nCome to me.

When Arnold speaks of the Sea of Faith retreating, he seems to be setting \r\nthe stage for Modernism, which to some degree was a movement of skeptics who \r\ndoubted that the wisdom contained \r\nin the Bible was the revelation of an all-knowing God.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti wrote a handful of immortal poems, and that makes her an \r\nimmortal poet. \r\nTwo of her poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Her Surgery\r\nby Jack Butler\r\n\r\nI\r\nOver the city the moon rides in mist,\r\nscrim scarred with faint rainbow.\r\nTwo days till Easter.The thin clouds run slow, slow,\r\nthe wind bells bleed the quietest\r\nof possible musics to the dark lawn.\r\nAll possibility we will have children is gone.\r\n\r\nII\r\nI raise a glass half water, half alcohol,\r\nto that light come full again.\r\nInside, you sleep, somewhere below the pain.\r\nDown at the river, there is a tall\r\nghost tossing flowers to dark water\r\njessamine, rose, and daisy, salvia lyrata . . .\r\n\r\nIII\r\nOh goodbye, goodbye to bloom in the white blaze\r\nof moon on the river, goodbye\r\nto creek joining the creek joining the river, the axil, the Y,\r\ngoodbye to the Yes of two Ifs in one phrase . . .\r\nChildren bear children. We are grown,\r\nand time has thrown us free under the timeless moon.\r\n\r\nJack Butler is one of my favorite contemporary poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bishop wrote a small handful of truly great poems such as One Art, \r\nThe Fish and The Armadillo, and can probably be considered a major poet as a \r\nresult.\r\n\r\nSometimes Mysteriously\r\n\r\nby Luis Omar Salinas\r\n\r\nSometimes in the evening when love\r\ntunes its harp and the crickets\r\ncelebrate life, I am like a troubadour\r\nin search of friends, loved ones,\r\nanyone who will share with me\r\na bit of conversation. My loneliness\r\narrives ghostlike and pretentious,\r\nit seeks my soul, it is ravenous\r\nand hurting. I admire my father\r\nwho always has advice in these matters,\r\nbut a game of chess won\'t do, or\r\nthe frivolity of religion.\r\nI want to find a solution, so I\r\nwrite letters, poems, and sometimes\r\nI touch solitude on the shoulder\r\nand surrender to a great tranquility.\r\nI understand I need courage\r\nand sometimes, mysteriously,\r\nI feel whole.\r\n\r\nLuis Omar Salinas is generally considered to be one of the very best Hispanic \r\npoets to write in English, with good cause. Sometimes Mysteriously is one of \r\nthose mysterious poems that sometimes makes us feel a special kinship with the \r\npoet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maidens Song \r\nMedieval Lyric, Poet Unknown\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maidens came when I was in my mothers bower.\r\nI had all that I would.\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n   The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nThe silver is white, red is the gold;\r\nThe robes they lay in fold.\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n  The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nAnd through the glass window shines the sun.\r\nHow should I love, and I so young?\r\n\r\n  The bailey beareth the bell away;\r\n  The lily, the rose, the rose I lay.\r\n\r\nTime in Eternity\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nWhen you were as an angel in my arms,\r\nHad laid your bare head just below my chin,\r\nYour length pressed up to mine, entrusting charms\r\nMy whole youth\'s starward longing could not win;\r\nWith still the murmur of your love in me,\r\nMiracle-tones of all my lifelong hope,\r\nI wished that there might start eternity\r\nAnd seal forever that sweet envelope;\r\nAnd as it did, my thoughts are now for you\r\nAs every star is blotted by the sun,\r\nAnd so the sun itself\r\nHas perished too,\r\nAnd with it, every dream of mine\r\nBut one.\r\n\r\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets.\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nIn poems like Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night, In My Craft or Sullen Art and Fern Hill the Welsh poet \r\nDylan Thomas ranks with any poet who ever wrote in English. Several of his poems can be found on the Masters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 147\r\n\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\r\n For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\r\n\r\nit may not always be so; and i say\r\nby e.e. cummings\r\n\r\nit may not always be so;and i say\r\nthat if your lips,which i have loved,should touch\r\nanother\'s,and your dear strong fingers clutch\r\nhis heart,as mine in time not far away;\r\nif on another\'s face your sweet hair lay\r\nin such a silence as i know,or such\r\ngreat writhing words as,uttering overmuch,\r\nstand helplessly before the spirit at bay;\r\n\r\nif this should be,i say if this should be\r\nyou of my heart,send me a little word;\r\nthat i may go unto him,and take his hands,\r\nsaying,Accept all happiness from me.\r\nThen shall i turn my face,and hear one bird\r\nsing terribly afar in the lost lands.\r\n\r\nShe Walks In Beauty\r\nby Lord Bryon\r\n\r\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\r\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\r\nAnd all that\'s best of dark and bright\r\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes:\r\nThus mellow\'d to that tender light\r\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\r\n\r\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\r\nHad half impair\'d the nameless grace\r\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\r\nOr softly lightens o\'er her face;\r\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express\r\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nAnd on that cheek, and o\'er that brow,\r\nSo soft, so calm, yet eloquent,\r\nThe smiles that win, the tints that glow,\r\nBut tell of days in goodness spent,\r\nA mind at peace with all below,\r\nA heart whose love is innocent!\r\n\r\nMeeting at Night\r\nby Robert Browning\r\n\r\nThe grey sea and the long black land;\r\nAnd the yellow half-moon large and low;\r\nAnd the startled little waves that leap\r\nIn fiery ringlets from their sleep,\r\nAs I gain the cove with pushing prow,\r\nAnd quench its speed i\' the slushy sand.\r\n\r\nThen a mile of warm sea-scented beach;\r\nThree fields to cross till a farm appears;\r\nA tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch\r\nAnd blue spurt of a lighted match,\r\nAnd a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,\r\nThan the two hearts beating each to each!\r\nMad Girl\'s Love Song\r\nby Sylvia Plath \r\n\r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;\r\nI lift my lids and all is born again.\r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nThe stars go waltzing out in blue and red,\r\nAnd arbitrary blackness gallops in:\r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that you bewitched me into bed\r\nAnd sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.\r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nGod topples from the sky, hell\'s fires fade:\r\nExit seraphim and Satan\'s men:\r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.\r\n\r\nI fancied you\'d return the way you said,\r\nBut I grow old and I forget your name.\r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\n\r\nI should have loved a thunderbird instead;\r\nAt least when spring comes they roar back again.\r\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.\r\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)\r\nShall I Compare Thee to a Summer\'s Day?\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nShall I compare thee to a summer\'s day?\r\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\r\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\r\nAnd summer\'s lease hath all too short a date.\r\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\r\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\r\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\r\nBy chance, or nature\'s changing course untrimmed.\r\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\r\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\'st;\r\nNor shall death brag thou wand\'rest in his shade,\r\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\'st,\r\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\r\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\r\nWho ever loved\r\nby Christopher Marlowe\r\n\r\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is overruled by fate.\r\nWhen two are stripped, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should love, the other win;\r\n\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows; let it suffice\r\nWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever loved, that loved not at first sight?\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night,\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors;\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death.\r\n\r\nHeart, we will forget him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nHeart, we will forget him,\r\nYou and I, tonight!\r\nYou must forget the warmth he gave,\r\nI will forget the light.\r\n\r\nWhen you have done pray tell me,\r\nThen I, my thoughts, will dim.\r\nHaste! \'lest while youre lagging\r\nI may remember him!\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\nJohn Donne wrote some of the sexiest poems in the English language, and some of \r\nthe best devotional poems as well. Talk about range!\r\n\r\nOne of their Gods \r\nby Constantine P. Cavafy\r\n\r\nWhen one of them moved through the centre of Selefkia\r\njust as it was getting dark\r\nmoved like a young man, tall, extremely handsome,\r\nthe joy of being immortal in his eyes,\r\nhis hair black and perfumed\r\nthe people going by would gaze at him,\r\nand one would ask the other if he knew him,\r\nif he was a Greek from Syria, or a stranger.\r\nBut some who looked more carefully\r\nwould understand and step aside;\r\nand as he disappeared under the arcades,\r\namong the shadows and the evening lights,\r\ngoing toward the quarter that lives\r\nonly at night, with orgies and debauchery,\r\nwith every kind of intoxication and desire,\r\nthey would wonder which of Them it could be,\r\nand for what suspicious pleasure\r\nhe\'d come down into the streets of Selefkia\r\nfrom the August Celestial Mansions.\r\nLove Letter\r\nbySylvia Plath\r\n\r\nNot easy to state the change you made.\r\nIf I\'m alive now, then I was dead,\r\nThough, like a stone, unbothered by it,\r\nStaying put according to habit.\r\nYou didn\'t just tow me an inch, no\r\nNor leave me to set my small bald eye\r\nSkyward again, without hope, of course,\r\nOf apprehending blueness, or stars.\r\n\r\nThat wasn\'t it. I slept, say: a snake\r\nMasked among black rocks as a black rock\r\nIn the white hiatus of winter\r\nLike my neighbors, taking no pleasure\r\nIn the million perfectly-chisled\r\nCheeks alighting each moment to melt\r\nMy cheeks of basalt. They turned to tears,\r\nAngels weeping over dull natures,\r\nBut didn\'t convince me. Those tears froze.\r\nEach dead head had a visor of ice.\r\n\r\nAnd I slept on like a bent finger.\r\nThe first thing I was was sheer air\r\nAnd the locked drops rising in dew\r\nLimpid as spirits. Many stones lay\r\nDense and expressionless round about.\r\nI didn\'t know what to make of it.\r\nI shone, mice-scaled, and unfolded\r\nTo pour myself out like a fluid\r\nAmong bird feet and the stems of plants.\r\nI wasn\'t fooled. I knew you at once.\r\n\r\nTree and stone glittered, without shadows.\r\nMy finger-length grew lucent as glass.\r\nI started to bud like a March twig:\r\nAn arm and a leg, and arm, a leg.\r\nFrom stone to cloud, so I ascended.\r\nNow I resemble a sort of god\r\nFloating through the air in my soul-shift\r\nPure as a pane of ice.
