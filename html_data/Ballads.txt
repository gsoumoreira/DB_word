Who wrote the best \r\nballads, other than Anonymous? Which ballads are the the best? In an attempt to answer such questions, \r\nI have put together a page designed to \r\ntrace the evolution of the English ballad via a detailed timeline.But first, let\'s begin with a definition: what exactly is a ballad? Most ballads \r\ntell a story and are either set to music or written in rhythmic verse. Ballads \r\nbegan with the Medieval French chanson ballad\xe9e, or danced songs. The \r\nballad is related to ballet, or dancing to music. Think of country folk \r\ntwo-stepping to stories set to fiddle music. The words were either chanted or \r\nsung by minstrels. Over time the term ballad came to \r\ninclude sentimental love songs and those over-the-top compositions we now call \r\npower ballads. But they are far removed from the ancient English \r\nballads that originated in the Northlands. The best original ballads were far \r\nfrom sentimental: they were unsentimental, direct, definite in their imagery, \r\nhard-hitting, usually tragic, and often quite spooky due to supernatural \r\nelements. They often combined a fierce realism with the paranormal. The best \r\nancient ballads were memorable, danceable and highly entertaining in their dark \r\nway. They often employed repetition in the form of a chorus or refrain. The \r\nrefrain could either make sense, or not. An example of a meaningful refrain is \r\nthis one from the Cleveland Lyke Wake Dirge: And Christe receive thy \r\nsaule (soul). An example of a nonsensical refrain is: Lollai, lollai, litil \r\nchild! from \r\nThou Wandrest in this Fals (False) World. \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael \r\nR.

Harold \r\nBloom called it the most \r\nmagnificent Anonymous poem in the language, a \'mad song\' that surpasses Edgar\'s \r\nsnatches of song in King Lear, and the later lyrics in that genre by \r\nWilliam Blake, Sir Walter Scott and William Butler Yeats. I have observed \r\nthat the final stanza of Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song is like Don Quixote, \r\nperhaps the greatest novel of all time, compressed into one otherworldly, \r\nhaunting stanza. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBallad Timeline\r\n\r\nSome of the best early poems in the English language are the ancient anonymous \r\nballads (see the entry for 1200). The ballad tradition was revived in modern \r\ntimes by a number of famous Romantic poets, including Robert Burns and Sir \r\nWalter Scott (both Scottish), William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and \r\nJohn Keats (all English), and Edgar Allan Poe (American). \r\n\r\n950 \x97 The Exeter Book may contain the first extant \r\nEnglish poems written by women:\r\nWulf and Eadwacer \r\nand\r\nThe Wife\'s Lament. \r\nWulf and Eadwacer appears to be the first English poem with a refraina \r\nhallmark of the ballad. Was the first English ballad thus written by a woman?\r\n \r\n\r\n1200 \x97 English \r\nfolk music has existed at least since the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain \r\ncirca 400 AD. The Venerable Bede\'s story of the cattleman and  \r\necclesiastical musician C\xe6dmon indicates that in the early medieval period it \r\nwas normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing vain and idle songs. It \r\nis not easy to date the earliest popular ballads, but they clearly had become popular by \r\nthe close of the Middle English period. Because they were passed down orally, \r\nsome of them could be considerably older. Perhaps the best we can say is that \r\nthe ballads mentioned here were probably composed sometime from 1200 to 1700, \r\nbut could be older: Sir \r\nPatrick Spens (Spence), Edward, Lord Randal, Bonny Barbara Allan, \r\nThe Wife of \r\nUsher\'s Well, The Unquiet Grave, The Three Ravens, The Douglas Tragedy, \r\nMary \r\nHamilton, The Bitter Withy, Lamkin, The Twa Sisters (The Two Sisters), \r\nThomas \r\nthe Rhymer, The Knight and Shepherd\'s Daughter, Get Up and Bar the Door, Chevy Chase, The Cherry-Tree Carol, \r\nTam Lin, Judas, and the \r\nearly Robin Hood ballads.\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, we will use the best publication dates that we \r\nhave been able to find. But please keep in mind that a poem or song could have been \r\ncomposed long before it was finally published.\r\n\r\n1350 \x97 In the ballad Robin and Gamelyn, Gamelyn\'s older brother cheats him of \r\nhis inheritance and becomes a sheriff. Roberte and Robin as a contraction \r\nappear in the ballad. Robin is described as good and the bow is emphasised. Thus \r\nthe ballad \r\nappears to involve Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n1450 \x97\r\nThe earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad that employs the name Robin \r\nHood is the 15th century Robin Hood and the Monk. This is \r\npreserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450, it \r\ncontains many of the elements still associated with the Robin Hood legend, from the \r\nNottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff (now \r\nknown as the Sheriff of Nottingham). \r\n\r\n1495 \x97\r\nA reference in William Langland\'s Piers Plowman indicates that ballads about \r\nRobin Hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century. Wynkyn de \r\nWorde\'s collection of Robin Hood ballads was printed about 1495.\r\n\r\n1600 \x97 Sir Patrick Spens (Spence) is one of the most popular of the \r\nso-called Child Ballads and is \r\nof Scottish origin. It is a maritime ballad about a disaster at sea.\r\n\r\n1620 \x97 Tom O\'Bedlam\'s Song \r\nis published around this time, but could have been composed earlier. \r\nThe existence of a chorus suggests that the poem may originally have been sung \r\nas a ballad. Harold Bloom has called it the best anonymous lyric in the English \r\nlanguage and has suggested Shakespeare as the author because the poem is so goodno, \r\nmake that so amazingly good. In my opinion, the poem is like Don Quixote \r\ncompressed into a few stellar lines. \r\n\r\n1782 \x97 Robert Burns, generally considered to be the greatest Scottish poet, \r\npublishes John Barleycorn: a Ballad. \r\n\r\n1782 \x97 Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge appears \r\nin the first edition of Lyrical Ballads, which becomes the primary text \r\nof the English Romantic Movement. \r\n\r\n1802 \x97 Sir Walter Scott publishes the traditional Scottish ballad Lord \r\nRandall in his book Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.\r\n\r\n1820 \x97 La Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats is published. \r\n\r\n1849 \x97 Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe, an American poet, is published.\r\n\r\n\r\n1889 \x97 The Ballad of Moll Magee by William Butler Yeats, generally \r\nconsidered to be the greatest Irish poet, is published. \r\n\r\n1898 \x97 The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde is published. Wilde \r\nactually did hard time in Reading Gaol, for the crime of being homosexual. \r\n\r\n1909 \x97 Ballad of the Goodly Fere by Ezra Pound is published. Pound was \r\none of the most influential poets of English modernism, along with his prot\xe9g\xe9 \r\nT. S. Eliot. \r\n\r\n1954 \x97 The Ballad of Davy Crockett is a song with music by George Bruns and lyrics by \r\nThomas W. Blackburn. It was introduced on ABC\'s television series Disneyland, in \r\nthe premiere episode of October 27, 1954. Fess Parker is shown performing the \r\nsong on a log cabin set, in frontiersman clothes, accompanied by similarly \r\nattired musicians. The song would later be heard throughout the Disneyland \r\ntelevision miniseries Davy Crockett, first telecast on December 15, 1954. Parker \r\nplayed the role of Davy Crockett and continued in four other episodes made by \r\nWalt Disney Studios. Buddy Ebsen co-starred as \r\nGeorge Georgie Russel, and Jeff York played legendary boatman Mike Fink. \r\nThe theme song was originally performed by The Wellingtons. The \r\nfirst album version was recorded by Bill Hayes,; it was quickly followed by versions by \r\nFess Parker and Tennessee Ernie Ford. All three versions made the Billboard \r\nmagazine charts in 1955: Hayes\' version made #1 on the weekly chart and #7 for \r\nthe year, Parker\'s reached #6 on the weekly charts and #31 for the year, while \r\nFord\'s peaked at #4 on the weekly country chart and #5 on the weekly pop chart \r\nand charted at #37 for the year. A fourth version, by bluegrass singer Mac \r\nWiseman, reached #10 on the radio charts in 1955. The song also reached #1 on \r\nthe Cash Box charts. A contemporary version also exists by the Western singing group \r\nthe Sons of the Pioneers. Over ten million copies of the song were sold. Members \r\nof the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs \r\nof all time.\r\n\r\nThe quoted commentary below is by Serene Dominic, who writes about music for \r\nMetro Times ...\r\n\r\n1973 \x97 Styx releases the first true power ballad! Take the solemn seriousness \r\nof ELP and Pink Floyd and marry it with the histrionics of community theater and \r\nyou\x92ve got Styx! Their chief weapon of surprise: Dennis DeYoung, who appears as \r\nharmless as a carpet salesmen but has a silly streak that would gag Freddie \r\nMercury. He pens \'Lady,\' which belatedly becomes a Top Ten hit two years later, \r\nprompting DeYoung to include at least one \'intimate\' love sonnet per album that \r\nsounded as though it was being sung to his beloved from 150 rows away. \r\n(Aerosmith is a closet contender with Dream On and its mystical vibewe \r\nshould dream about something even though the good Lord is preparing to take us \r\naway. Makes perfect sense!)\r\n\r\n1974 \x97 Paul Anka releases \x93(You\x92re) Having My Baby\x94 and sets power ballads back \r\na year! The \'My Way\' composer still maintains that, had the megaton mix been \r\nreleased instead of the sugary substitute that went to Number One, every metal \r\nband of the \x9280s would have had to bow down and make a hair extension love \r\noffering to him.\r\n\r\n1977 \x97 Styx Creates the First Homoerotic Power Ballad! The Chicagoons accrue a \r\nsecond chief weapon of surprise\x97Tommy Shaw, the first credible recording artist \r\nwith braces since Jan Brady! Another reason Shaw never smiles for group photos\x97Dennis DeYoung takes the band into lad-baiting territory with \'Come Sail Away\' \r\nwhich he sings like Captain Bligh tryin\x92 to score! Ay-ay\x97yi yi yi!\r\n\r\n1978 \x97 Journey morphs into Jefferson Starship without any Grace! Steve Perry \r\njoins the ranks and breaks power ballad tradition by singing to a province \r\ninstead of a chick on \'Lights\' \x97 Journey\x92s first power ballad to crack the Top \r\n70. His insertion of a Sam Cooke yodel in every conceivable air pocket and \r\nrampant mispronunciation of the word \'city\' \x97 so it sounds like he\x92s talking \r\nabout a piece of furniture \x97 doesn\x92t sit well with Greg Rolie, the group\x92s \r\nkeyboard player and original vocalist, now reduced to one vocal per album like \r\nRingo. What a pit-tayyyy!\r\n\r\n1979 \x97 Styx scores the first Number One power ballad with \x93Babe\x94! Journey hits \r\nthe Top 20 with \x93Lovin\x92, Touchin\x92, Squeezin\x92\x94! For his winning, wussy efforts, \r\nDeYoung is secretly ousted from Styx before being reinstated at double the silly \r\nstrength. Meanwhile on the Journey front, Greg Rolie gripes that singing 77 na \r\nna\x92s or 154 individual na\x92s at the end of \x93Lovin\x92, Touchin\x92, Squeezin\x92\x94 is \r\nperhaps not the best use of a jazz-fusion rock group\x92s time. In retaliation, \r\nJourney names its next album Departure in the hopes that Greg Rolie will take \r\nthe hint and leave. He does!\r\n\r\n1980 \x97 Styx unleashes the first power ballad-driven concept album. How d\x92ya \r\nmake the Depression more depressing than it was the first time around? Stick \r\nStyx in a time machine set for 1928 A.D. and people won\x92t even wait for the \r\nstock market crash to start jumping out of windows. Whenever Dennis DeYoung \r\nsings \'The Best of Times\' from Paradise Theater, he navigates around the word \r\n\'honey\' with all the uneasiness of a cloistered monk.\r\n\r\n1981 \x97 REO goes to Number One with \x93Keep On Loving You.\x94 And Kevin Cronin keeps \r\non writing it until fans don\x92t wanna keep on buying it. After 1987, the hits \r\nstop completely. Behind the scenes, they tell themselves that it\x92s all Nirvana\x92s \r\nfault.\r\n\r\n1982 \x97 Journey has three Top Ten power ballads from the Escape album!\r\n\r\n1984-2002 \x97 Everyone on planet Earth records a power ballad! The timeline gets \r\nadmittedly fuzzy from here on, with everyone from Richard Marx to the Scorpions \r\nto Bonnie Tyler to USA For Africa to Poison to Metallica to Nickelback diluting \r\nthe original recipe. The worst offender has to be Celine Dion, who actually injects \r\nthe word \'power\' into every ballad, inspiring fear in the manner that only an \r\noverly emotive nuclear reactor might.\r\n\r\nBut never fear, there are more power ballads to come, care of American Idol \r\n(which kicked off in 2002) and other talent shows. Now the amateurs can belt out \r\npower ballads, doing their best (or worst) impressions \r\nof Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Little Richard, \r\nMarvin Gaye, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Diana Ross, Janis Joplin, \r\nNeil Diamond, Ann Wilson, Freddy Mercury, Tina Turner, Meat Loaf, Peter Cetera, \r\nBrian Adams, Air Supply, Toto, Wayne Newton, Huey Lewis, David Hasselhoff, Tiny \r\nTim, Peewee Herman, et al!\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
