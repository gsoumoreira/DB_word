Burch\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\nThis is a page of poems about Darfur, but more importantly of poems and prayers for Darfur, by poets who stand in solidarity \r\nwith our brothers and sisters there. We are asking the people of the world to understand that when the United States acts \r\nunilaterally, often all hell breaks loose, so it\'s up to the United Nations and all the nations and peoples of the earth to \r\ncome together to help resolve the terrible problems currently afflicting Darfur. Ethnic cleansing and genocide are the world\'s problems: \r\nterrible symptoms of the heart disease and brain disease that continue to plague humanity. We also challenge all the \r\nreligions of the world to denounce racism, intolerance, ethnic cleansing, genocide, slavery and all forms of inequality and violence. Surely \r\nlove, mercy and compassion are the watchwords of any true religion. Also, if you are a student, teacher, educator, peace activist or just \r\nsomeone who cares and wants to help, please read \r\nHow Can We End Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide Forever? and do what you can to make the world a safer, happier place for \r\nchildren of all races and creeds.\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nFor the Children of Darfur, with Butterflies\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhere does the butterfly go\r\nwhen lightning rails, when thunder howls,\r\nwhen hailstones scream, when winter scowls\r\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\r\nWhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\r\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\r\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\r\nWhen the only relief\'s a banked fire\'s glow,\r\nwhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\r\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\r\nand hope is lost without a trace?\r\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\r\nwhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\nRally for Darfur\r\nby Rabbi J. Rolando Matalon\r\n\r\nIn the Armenian genocide it was written and in Darfur it is being sealed:\r\nHow many shall join the hundreds of thousands who have already perished,\r\nand how many shall be born into a horrible life, \r\n\r\nwho shall live and who shall die,\r\n\r\nIn the Shoah genocide it was written and in Darfur it is being sealed:\r\nwho shall be raped and who shall be tortured, \r\n\r\nwho shall perish by sword and who by bullets, \r\n\r\nwhich village shall be burned and which well shall be poisoned,\r\n\r\nIn the Cambodian genocide it was written and in Darfur it is being sealed:\r\nwho will make it to the refugee camp and who will die on the way,\r\nwho will die by hunger and who by thirst, \r\n\r\nwho by disease and who by plague,\r\n\r\nIn the Bosnian genocide it was written and in Darfur it is being sealed:\r\nWho will have their food rations cut and who will get enough food for another day,\r\nWhose child will die and whose will survive. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Rwandan genocide it was written and in Darfur it is being sealed:\r\nwho will remain silent and who will scream for action \r\n\r\nwho will be complacent and who will have moral courage \r\n\r\nwho will cave in to despair and who will be elevated by hope.\r\n\r\nBut using our voices, exercising our power and demanding action\r\ncan help save lives NOW.\r\n\r\nDua/Prayer for the People of Darfur, Sudan \r\nby Imam A. Rasheid Omar\r\n\r\nO Allah, thou art Peace and Peace emanates from thee. \r\nAllow us to live and to subsist in Peace, O Most Merciful\r\nof those who show Mercy.\r\nO Compassionate One, O Companion to every lonesome one, we implore you to comfort the hearts of the people\r\nof Darfur with your magnificence.\r\nLord of all Humankind, from what we have witnessed, grant us the grace to have a greater understanding and\r\nempathy for the suffering of innocent victims of the war in the Sudan, no matter their, ethnicity, color or religion.\r\nAll-wise and All-mighty God, Grant the leaders of the Sudan wisdom and guide them to use their power to serve\r\nthe good of all and to fashion a more just and caring world.\r\nAmin.\r\n\r\nDear God, in the matter of Darfur\r\nby the Covenant Community Church in Raleigh, N.C. \r\n\r\n\r\nDear God, \r\nin the matter of Darfur, help me to\r\nbe concerned without cynicism\r\ninvolved without fear\r\nspeak without rancor\r\npray without ceasing\r\nlive without complicity\r\nso that with my brothers and sisters in Darfur we may \r\n\r\nlive with hope\r\nact with confidence\r\nspeak truth with strength\r\nand become your loving presence on this earth. Amen. \r\n\r\n\r\nA Prayer for the People of Darfur \r\nby Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks\r\n\r\nO God of peace, who commands us to seek peace, send peace to the people of Darfur.\r\nO God of compassion, who hears the cry of the afflicted, hear the cry of the victims, the bereaved, the injured, and\r\nall those who live their days in fear.\r\nRouse the hearts of the leaders of the world to put an end to the bloodshed, the violence, the rape, the starvation,\r\nand the terror that has ravaged and endangered an entire population.\r\nBe with those who are working for peace, or tending the sick, or bringing food to the hungry, or shelter to the\r\nhomeless, or hope to those who are close to despair.\r\nO God of justice and love, let us not be indifferent to the cry of the persecuted and the ears of those who have\r\nseen their homes, their families, and their communities destroyed.\r\nAnd may their plea and their plight reach the ears and hearts of those who have it in their power to bring peace to\r\na troubled region and aid to a devastated people.\r\nOseh shalom bimromavmay You who makes peace in Your high places help us make peace down here on earth.\r\n\r\nVigil for Darfur\r\nby Sabina Carlson\r\n\r\nHold up your candle if you are an angel.\r\nHold up your candle if the light of hope\r\ndances and curls about your spine\r\nlike the breath of light\r\nabout the wick.\r\n\r\nOr blow out your candle if you believe\r\nthat when\r\nthese flames flicker out\r\nwe will forget\r\nthe faces we now see before us:\r\nthe faces\r\nof the hopeful,\r\nand the memory of the abused.\r\n\r\nHold up your candle\r\nif the people standing alongside you\r\nhave become your wings,\r\nso that\r\nside by side\r\nwe fly\r\nto a better place and time.\r\n\r\nHold up your candle if you know that sound \r\n\r\ndoes not travel\r\nthrough air and wires but rather through the \r\n\r\nchords\r\nof our hearts and that we will never\r\nbe able to claim\r\nthat we could not hear\r\na single cry\r\nbecause a deafening ocean\r\nstood between us.\r\n\r\nHold up your candle if you remember\r\nhow the world forgot 800\r\nthousand Rwandans,\r\nhold up your candle if you have a hole\r\nburnt into your heart\r\nby the Shoah, the Great Fire,\r\nthe Holocaust\r\nand hold up your candle if you can still see \r\n\r\nthe smoke\r\nand taste the ashes.\r\n\r\nHold up your candle\r\nif you know\r\nthat tears\r\nonly feed\r\nthat fire.\r\n\r\nAnd hold up your candle\r\nif you refuse to let the world\r\nsob itself to sleep, waiting for a wish,\r\nbecause we did not listen to them,\r\nbecause we did not burn with them,\r\nbecause we did not tell them\r\nI am\r\ngoing\r\nto save you.\r\nHere,\r\nI am your miracle.\r\n\r\nFor who\r\ndares to say that miracles are simply\r\nthe dusted spines\r\nof Bibles?\r\nFriends, look\r\nat the crying wings you stand\r\nside by side with, listen to the heavenly\r\npsalms of hope and hurt, feel your heart\r\nrise\r\nthrough the halo above your head\r\nto join with a hundred thousand others\r\nwho will heal\r\nthis world.\r\nhold up your candle\r\nif you\r\nare an angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArt by Anne R.

Of course they were\r\n\ttempted to lie down for a moment,\r\n\r\n\tunder the lone tree, with its barely shade,\r\n\tto rest just a little while before moving on, \r\n\r\n\tthe days passing slyly, hallucinations\r\n\tfloating like kites above them\r\n\tuntil the blanched bones lay scattered in a \r\n\tring around the tree,\r\n\ttiny ribs, skulls, hip bonesa tea set overturned,\r\n\tas the hot winds whistled through them \r\n\tas they would anything, really,\r\n\r\n\tand the sky, finally exhausted,\r\n\tmoving on.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nPublished in\r\n\tBest American Poetry 2008; originally published in The Kenyon Review\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDarfur\r\nby Dr. Amitabh Mitra \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSuddenly a baby cries \r\n\t\t\t\tMalnourished \r\n\t\t\t\tMaltreated \r\n\t\t\t\tAnd ravaged \r\n\t\t\t\tMen woman and children \r\n\t\t\t\tHang by their \r\n\t\t\t\tSkin to \r\n\t\t\t\tMirages \r\n\t\t\t\tthe desert burns the skull \r\n\t\t\t\tof all reasons \r\n\t\t\t\tStorms that sweep \r\n\t\t\t\tInto their eyes \r\n\t\t\t\tLocks up \r\n\t\t\t\tWithin corneas \r\n\t\t\t\tDaring death to open them \r\n\t\t\t\tDarfur has no word \r\n\t\t\t\tDarfur has no meaning \r\n\t\t\t\tDarfur has deaths \r\n\t\t\t\tThe baby squeaks \r\n\t\t\t\tBecause only \r\n\t\t\t\tHe has the pride to \r\n\t\t\t\tKnow \r\n\t\t\t\tWhen the \r\n\t\t\t\tJanjaweed \r\n\t\t\t\tAre coming \r\n\t\t\t\tIts time then \r\n\t\t\t\tThe mirages are \r\n\t\t\t\tslashed open \r\n\t\t\t\tBy flashing swords and \r\n\t\t\t\tFaceless marauders \r\n\t\t\t\tScreams will be a welcome whirlwind \r\n\t\t\t\tChasing the sun again.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarfur (Jesus Wept)\r\nby William F.

Merrill\r\n\r\nYou, who read no calm reportings\r\nOf alien, distant, dire events,\r\nBut shriek and keen as loves go down\r\nBeyond all help, to violence;\r\nWhose temple\'s walls, stormstruck and split\r\nBy sizzling bolts collapse around,\r\nWhile mid the crash of chaos hope\r\nWhirls in a death-spin to the ground;\r\nYou, who alone in deep distress\r\nCry out for help where there is none,\r\nAll you whom I shall never know:\r\nI know a portion nonetheless \r\nOfcruel trials you undergo.\r\n\r\nKillers in many guises come: \r\nSudden as electric shock\r\nOr looming ghostly as a shark\r\nLeisurely finning toward its mark.\r\nI who breathless and sweating once\r\nWrestled a devil to the floor,\r\nAnd saw him rise again when he\r\nFinished what he began before,\r\nI who re-learned each childhood prayer\r\nForgotten,to the stars once more\r\nSend up apoor and hopeless plea\r\nFor spirit\'s peace beyond despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTears of Darfur\r\nby Mahnaz Badihian\r\n\r\nO tired land\r\nO depressed sky of Darfur\r\nO plain of no breath\r\nYou are bleeding from all corners\r\nOf your dreams\r\nThe bosom of your land\r\nWeeps the bitterness of blood\r\nO tearful Darfur,\r\nCan your hungry hands \r\nOne day cultivate those \r\nDry, sad roots, left from\r\nThe countless bones \r\nOf your children\r\nCan your simple dreams\r\nOf having a\r\nLoaf of bread and a roof above\r\nCome through?\r\nMaybe,\r\nMaybe one day\r\nThose broken wings \r\nWill heal \r\nWith the caressing hands \r\nOf peace\r\nWe the people of the world \r\nWith our tearful eyes \r\nWaiting on the day that \r\nAcacias will bloom \r\nOn the lands where \r\nThe dream of innocence pours\r\nOn these hopeless days\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWar Metaphysics for a Sudanese Girl\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrie Kusserow\r\n\r\n\r\nI leave the camp, unable to breathe, \r\n\r\nme Freud girl, after her interior,\r\nshe Lost Girl, after my purse, \r\n\r\nher face: \r\ndark as eggplant,\r\nher gaze: \r\nunpinnable, untraceable, \r\nfloating, open, defying the gravity\r\nI was told keeps pain in place. \r\n\r\nMaybe trauma doesn\'t harden, \r\npacked, tight as sediment at the bottom of her psyche,\r\ndry and cracked as the desert she crossed, \r\nmaybe memory doesn\'t stalk her \r\nwith its bulging eyes. \r\n\r\nOnce inside the body \r\ndoes war move up or down,\r\nmaybe the body pisses it out, \r\nmaybe it dissipates, like sweat and fog\r\nunder the heat of a colonial God, \r\nand in America, maybe it flavors dull muzungu lives,\r\neach refugee a bouillon cube of horror. \r\n\r\nMaybe war can\'t be soaked up\r\nby humans alone, \r\nthe way the rains in Sudan\r\nmove across the land, \r\ndrenching the ground, animals, camps, sky,\r\nno end to its roaming \r\nuntil further out, among the planets,\r\na stubborn galaxy finally mops it up,\r\nand it sits, hushed, \r\nred, sober, \r\n\r\nand below, the humans in the north\r\nwith their penchant for denial,\r\nnaming it aurora borealis. \r\n\r\n*Muzungu means white person in many Bantu languages of east, central and \r\nSouth Africa  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrie Kusserow\r\n\r\nSudanese Refugee Camp, Northwest Uganda\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOur drivers gun insanely over the dusty, red roads,\r\nlurching from pothole to pothole. \r\nCaravan of slick, adrenalized vans, \r\n\r\ntattooed with symbols of western aid, \r\nWill on my lap, trying to nurse between bumps,\r\nmy hands a helmet to his bobbing skull. \r\n\r\nA three-legged goat hobbles to the side \r\nand though we imagine we are a huge interruption,\r\nwomen balancing jeri cans on their heads, face our wake\r\nof dust and rage as they would any other gust of wind\r\n\r\nWater, sun, NGO. \r\n\r\nWe arrive covered in orange dust, coughing,\r\nfleet of SUVs parked under the trees, \r\nengines cooling, Star Trekkian cockpits flashing, \r\n\r\nalarms beeping and squawking as we zip-lock them up \r\nand leave them black-windowed, self-contained as UFO\'s. \r\n\r\nBehind the gate, we stumble through the boiling, shoulder deep sun,\r\nWill and I trying to play soccer \r\nas a trickle of Sudanese kids cross the road \r\n\r\nhanging against the fence, watching the chubby Muzungu boy\r\nI\'ve toted around Africa like a pot of gold. \r\nThree years old, he knows they\'re watching, so he does a little \r\ndance,\r\nhis SpiderMan shoes lighting up as he kicks the ball. \r\n\r\nII. \r\n\r\nPart African bush, part Wild West, \r\nwe\'re based in Arua, grungy, dusty frontiertown, \r\ngiant dieseled trucks barrel through, spreading their wake of \r\nadrenalin,\r\nobese sacks of grain lying like walrus inside. \r\n\r\nI chase Will from malarial puddle to puddle,\r\nwhite blouse frilled like a gaudy gladiola,\r\nlavish concern for my chubby son\r\nsuddenly rococo, absurd.\r\n\r\nIII. \r\n\r\n7 foot giants of the SPLA, huddle together, drinking,\r\ntalking Dinka politics, repatriation, the New Sudan, \r\nwives lanky as giraffes, set food on the table and disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn candlelight the men\'s forehead scars gleam\r\nI flutter around them acting more deferential than I\'m used to,\r\nslowly I\'m learning Sudanese grammar\r\nmen, verbs, women, the conjunctions that link them together. \r\n\r\nIn the thick of rain we walk home, \r\nUgandans huddled under their makeshift bird cages, \r\nWill now pointing to the basic vocabulary of this road\r\n\r\ndead snake, prickly bush, squealing pig, peeing child. \r\nThree drunk men huddled at a shack \r\nscrape the whiteness off us as we walk by.\r\n\r\nThough I don\'t want to hear it,\r\nthough I love Africa, \r\nit starts up anyway, the milky mother cells of my body high-fiving,\r\nmy mind quietly repeating the story of my son\'s lucky birth, \r\nhis rich American inheritance. \r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMy husband drops into bed, dragging a thick cloak of requests. \r\nAll day, I\'ve labored behind him, toting our clueless muzungu,\r\nwatching him, dogged Dutchman in his rubber clogs \r\n\r\nclimbing the soggy hills of Kampala, despite the noonday heat,\r\na posse of hopeful Lost Boys following him.\r\nHe, afraid of nothing, really; not even death,\r\nme afraid of everything really, most of all his death. \r\n\r\nIn the distance, trucks rev up to cross the bush \r\nwhere Sudanese families perched like kites caught in trees,\r\nwait for the next shipment.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s night now, \r\nthe three of us inside the cloud chamber of our mosquito net,\r\nthe two of them breathing, safe. \r\n\r\nWill\'s nursing again, though he doesn\'t need to,\r\nswelling like a tick \r\nand though I don\'t want to love \r\n\r\nthe sweet mists of our tiny tent home,\r\nthe lush wetlands of our lives, \r\nits thick rope bridges and gentle Ugandan hills, \r\n\r\nthe fat claw of my heart rises up,\r\nfertile, lucky, random \r\npulsing its victory song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMud\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrie Kusserow\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe pond black and bulging, \r\nice storm ruins poking from the water \r\nlike the stiff feet of, dare I say, fallen soldiers.\r\nRobert still in Sudan, \r\nback in Vermont, the kids and I limp through two weeks of cold rain, \r\n\r\nI drape Ana and Will in rain gear \r\nwatch the drunken tents run across the field. \r\nAna plunks her chubby toes into a fleet of tadpoles\r\ncold mud sucking her foot into its mouth. \r\n\r\nI drag the branches onto shore, \r\nglobs of frog eggs surface like transparent brains,\r\nAna cupping the dimpled jelly, \r\nthe dogs licking it like caviar. \r\nEntranced, she squeezes it \r\nuntil I tell her to stop \r\nbefore she crushes the eggs. \r\n\r\nI tell myself it\'s not quite violence but over eager love,\r\nthis lust with which they squeeze the living, \r\nsmearing the mud onto their own limbs. \r\nBut what of this blur \r\nbetween awe and destruction,\r\nlove and violence? \r\n\r\nAt night, the peepers, \r\nscreaming themselves into existence.\r\nTwo frogs griplocked onto a female, \r\nher flesh bulging between their swollen fingers. \r\nThey\'re wrestling, I say, not wanting to reveal the darker side of their \r\nmating. \r\n\r\nI gingerly pry the males off, Will cheering,\r\nAna serious and methodic \r\nuntil she finally dislodges the last one\'s grip with her twig\r\nand they fall apart wriggling in the grass. \r\n\r\nII. \r\n\r\nThe rains just started in Juba, south Sudan,\r\nmaking travel, and maybe war, near impossible. \r\nStill my husband pushes a saggy jeep for eight hours\r\nthrough four feet of mud, a Sudanese boy \r\nlying unconscious in the back seat. \r\n\r\nThe jeep rocking and lurching \r\non the only road cleared of mines \r\nas my husband tries to inch it forward, this, his own labor of love, \r\nlike birth, like sex, something always tears, \r\nhis foot jammed with a thorn as he heaves and sinks\r\nhis toenail tearing off, until even he gives up \r\nand forces them to turn back, \r\nstill 40 miles from Aliab, the whole village waiting for them, \r\ncaught in an outbreak of cholera, \r\nits one river littered with rusty ammunition,\r\ntrucks large as elephants lying on their sides. \r\n\r\nWhen Abraham, their Lost Boy,* came home after 18 years,\r\nthe elders sacrificed a white cow. \r\nJump over it, into peace, they cried \r\nwhile the women tipped their thin necks back,\r\ntheir whips of ululation uncoiling in the heat. \r\n\r\nIII. \r\n\r\nThe frogs, still wiggling on the grass, \r\nAna clutches the tan-pink female, \r\ndespite its eerie mask, she wants to take it home. \r\nI tell her just one night, \r\nthen we\'ll let it go back to its real home\r\nbut the next morning it\'s done the impossible,\r\njumped out of its three foot fortress. \r\n\r\nI roam the rooms crazed, desperate to find it.\r\nI do, \r\na day later, shrunken in the comer of the bathroom \r\nbut still breathing. I race it to the pond, \r\nchildren confused behind me, \r\nwatch it sink, stunned, then lethargically swim away, \r\nstill dried and wrinkled, despite its immersion in water,\r\nlike Abraham, now more American than Sudanese,\r\nsitting wide-eyed and stiff amidst the wailing and singing. \r\n\r\nIV. \r\n\r\nRobert home, worn out, but safe.\r\nI take a walk to the pond and find\r\na tan-pink frog, perhaps the same one,\r\nfloating in the water,\r\nI can\'t tell if it\'s alive or dead. \r\n\r\nI know how I came to be married to this man,\r\nI followed him from country to country,\r\ngripped him hard as the frogs\r\nStill he did not peel me off, as I have tried to do \r\nwith his over eager love, for this gangly, barren country of Sudan.\r\nWho knows what will be torn next, \r\nit\'s just what happens when you love the world\r\nand you move blindly, but well intentioned,\r\namidst the irresistible mud.\r\n\r\n*The Lost Boys refers to the 17,000 children in southern Sudan \r\nwho fled \r\ntheir homes in 1987 seeking refuge from the civil war. They walked 1,000 miles \r\nbefore they finally found protection in a Kenyan refugee camp, Kaukuma. By the \r\ntime they arrived there, half of the boys had died from starvation, thirst, \r\nsoldiers, lions and bandits. About 3,700 have recently been resettled in \r\nAmerica.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNews From Darfur\r\nby Joseph McDonough\r\n\r\nso much depends\r\nupon\r\n\r\na red cross\r\ntruck\r\n\r\nglistening with sun\r\nshine\r\n\r\nbeside the white\r\nman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarfur\r\nby Michael R.
