The English word didactic \r\nderives from the Greekdidaktikos(able to teach or \r\ninstruct). \r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF DIDACTIC EPIGRAMS: \r\n\r\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be. (William Shakespeare) \r\nTo thine own self be true. (William Shakespeare) \r\nLittle strokes / fell great oaks. (Benjamin Franklin)\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 129 \r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nYou forget me\r\nor you love another more.\r\nIt\'s over!\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 36 \r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nVain woman, foolish thing!\r\nDo you base your worth on a ring?\r\n\r\nA didactic poem \r\nusually means exactly what it says, and doesn\'t beat around the bush. There seems to be a modern myth that didactic poems are universally terrible, \r\nbut this page demonstrates that there are \r\ncommendable didactic poems that have stood the test of time. Alexander Pope\'s Essay on Criticism may be an example of a \r\ndidactic poem that has become unreadable for many modern readers. John Bunyan\'s \r\nPilgrim\'s Progress may be an example of an allegorical morality tale that has become \r\nlargely unreadable. But the \r\nexamples below \r\nprove \r\nthat certain types of didactic poetry remain viable in the 21st century. I have also \r\nincluded a number of didactic epigrams, which are short, pithy statements that \r\ncan be either poetry or prose.Michael R. Burch, editor,\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\nFamous didactic writers and teachers include Aristotle, William Blake, Buddha, John Bunyan, Robert Burns, \r\nGeoffrey Chaucer, Jesus Christ, Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, \r\nJohn Donne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Frost, Hesiod, Herman Hesse, Homer, Horace, Victor Hugo, Samuel \r\nJohnson, A. E. Housman, \r\nRudyard Kipling, Lucretius, Martial, John Milton, Muhammad, George Orwell, Ovid, Plato, Alexander Pope, Sappho, William Shakespeare, \r\n\r\nSocrates,\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe,\r\nJonathan Swift, Henry David Thoreau,\r\n\r\nMark Twain, Virgil, Voltaire, Walt Whitman \r\nand Oscar Wilde. \r\n\r\nDidactic poems do not have to be tedious, boring sermons.\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet whose work appears on this \r\npage. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be.\r\n\x97William Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice to a Girl by Sara Teasdale\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed;\r\nLay that on your heart,\r\nMy young angry dear;\r\nThis truth, this hard and precious stone,\r\nLay it on your hot cheek,\r\nLet it hide your tear.\r\nHold it like a crystal\r\nWhen you are alone\r\nAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.\r\nLong, look long and you will be blessed:\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed.\r\n\r\nTo thine own self be true. \r\n\x97William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nEternity\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nHe who binds to himself a joy,\r\nDoes the winged life destroy; \r\nHe who kisses the joy as it flies, \r\nLives in Eternity\'s sun rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake\'s poem reminds me of the Sting song that suggests: If you love \r\nsomebody, set them free.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle strokes \r\n\r\nfell great oaks.\r\nBen Franklin\r\n\r\nJerusalem\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\r\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\r\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\r\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\r\n\r\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\r\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\r\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\r\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\r\n\r\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\r\nBring me my arrows of desire:\r\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\r\nBring me my chariot of fire.\r\n\r\nI will not cease from mental fight,\r\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\r\nTill we have built Jerusalem\r\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe births of all things are weak and tender,\r\ntherefore we should have our eyes intent on beginnings.\r\nMichel de Montaigne\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden \r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth. \r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\nReligion is the opiate of the people.Karl Marx\r\nReligion is the dopiate of the sheeple.Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nLove distills desire upon the eyes, love brings bewitching grace into the heart.\r\nEuripides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nHere dead we lie we because we did not choose\r\n  To live and shame the land from which we sprung.\r\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\r\n  But young men think it is, and we were young.\r\n\r\nLove consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and commune with each other.\r\nRainer Maria Rilke\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening to empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the mass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots to make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; and home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, perishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there are left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, insufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, when he walked on earth.\r\n\r\nAny good that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now ... for I shall not pass this way again.\r\n\x97Etienne Griellet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nHe who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.\r\nSaint Basil\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\nEarly to bed, early to rise, makes \r\na man healthy, wealthy and wise. \r\nBen Franklin\r\n\r\nVirtue\r\nby George Herbert\r\n\r\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\r\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\r\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\nFor thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\nThy root is ever in its grave,\r\nAnd thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\r\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\r\nAnd all must die.\r\n\r\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\r\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\r\nThen chiefly lives.\r\n\r\nThe ballot is stronger than the bullet.\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\n\r\nLove Is Not All by Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof against the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and sink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breathNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making friends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be that in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor nagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love for peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I do not think I would.\r\n\r\nLove keeps the cold out better than a cloak.\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art \r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day.  Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel.  None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch.  And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.  It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifes saving graces are love, pleasure, laughter ...\r\nwisdom, it seems, is for the Hereafter.\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Lie\r\nby Sir Walter Ralegh\r\n\r\nGo, soul, the body\'s guest,\r\nUpon a thankless errand;\r\nFear not to touch the best;\r\nThe truth shall be thy warrant:\r\nGo, since I needs must die,\r\nAnd give the world the lie.\r\n\r\nSay to the court it glows\r\nAnd shines like rotten wood,\r\nSay to the church it shows\r\nWhat\'s good, and doth no good:\r\nIf church and court reply,\r\nThen give them both the lie.\r\n\r\nTell potentates, they live\r\nActing, by others\' action;\r\nNot lov\'d unless they give;\r\nNot strong, but by affection.\r\nIf potentates reply,\r\nGive potentates the lie.\r\n\r\nTell men of high condition,\r\nThat manage the estate,\r\nTheir purpose is ambition;\r\nTheir practice only hate.\r\nAnd if they once reply,\r\nThen give them all the lie.\r\n\r\nTell them that brave it most,\r\nThey beg for more by spending,\r\nWho in their greatest cost\r\nLike nothing but commending.\r\nAnd if they make reply,\r\nThen give them all the lie.\r\n\r\nTell zeal it wants devotion;\r\nTell love it is but lust;\r\nTell time it meets but motion;\r\nTell flesh it is but dust:\r\nAnd wish them not reply,\r\nFor thou must give the lie.\r\n\r\nTell age it daily wasteth;\r\nTell honour how it alters;\r\nTell beauty how she blasteth;\r\nTell favour how it falters:\r\nAnd as they shall reply,\r\nGive every one the lie.\r\n\r\nTell wit how much it wrangles\r\nIn fickle points of niceness;\r\nTell wisdom she entangles\r\nHerself in over-wiseness:\r\nAnd when they do reply,\r\nStraight give them both the lie.\r\n\r\nTell physic of her boldness;\r\nTell skill it is prevention;\r\nTell charity of coldness;\r\nTell law it is contention:\r\nAnd as they do reply,\r\nSo give them still the lie.\r\n\r\nTell fortune of her blindness;\r\nTell nature of decay;\r\nTell friendship of unkindness;\r\nTell justice of delay:\r\nAnd if they will reply,\r\nThen give them all the lie.\r\n\r\nTell arts they have no soundness,\r\nBut vary by esteeming;\r\nTell schools they want profoundness,\r\nAnd stand too much on seeming.\r\nIf arts and schools reply,\r\nGive arts and schools the lie.\r\n\r\nTell faith it\'s fled the city;\r\nTell how the country erreth;\r\nTell manhood, shakes off pity;\r\nTell virtue, least preferred.\r\nAnd if they do reply,\r\nSpare not to give the lie.\r\n\r\nSo when thou hast, as I\r\nCommanded thee, done blabbing;\r\nBecause to give the lie\r\nDeserves no less than stabbing:\r\nStab at thee, he that will,\r\nNo stab thy soul can kill!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we are to have real peace in the world,\r\nwe shall have to begin with the children.\r\n\r\nMohandas Gandhi\r\n\r\n\r\nMax Ehrmann\x92s Desiderata (Latin for desired \r\nthings) is a 1927 prose poem that was largely unknown in the author\'s lifetime. \r\nThe poem became widely known after being found at Adlai Stevenson\'s deathbed in \r\n1965.\r\n\r\nDesiderata\r\nby Max Ehrmann\r\n\r\nGo placidly amidst the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in \r\nsilence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. \r\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and \r\nthe ignorant; they too have their story. \r\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you \r\ncompare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there \r\nwill be greater and lesser persons than yourself. \r\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own \r\ncareer, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of \r\ntime. \r\nExercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. \r\nBut let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high \r\nideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. \r\nBe yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about \r\nlove; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as \r\nthe grass. \r\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of \r\nyouth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not \r\ndistress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and \r\nloneliness. \r\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of \r\nthe universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.\r\n\r\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as \r\nit should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and \r\nwhatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace \r\nwith your soul. With all its shams, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a \r\nbeautiful world. Be cheerful. \r\nStrive to be happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an Israeli, I have come to understand:\r\nthere is no way to love Israel and reject a two-state peace,\r\nno way to love Israel and reject Palestine.\r\n\x97Yael Dayan, the daughter of Moshe Dayan, Israel\'s most famous general\r\n\r\nOther Famous Didactic Poems and Prose Works:\r\n\r\nThe Lie by Sir Walter Ralegh\r\nBreathes There the Man by Sir Walter Scott\r\nA Dream Deferred by Langston Hughes \r\ni sing of Olaf, glad and big by e. e. cummings \r\nCredo by E.
