I use the term after in my \r\ntranslations because these are loose translations and interpretations, rather than \r\nword-for-word translations. The poets represented here include some of the most \r\nfamous names in ancient Greek literature, such as Anacreon, Plato and Simonides.Michael R. Burch, editor, The HyperTexts\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nBut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Plato\r\n\r\nPasserby,\r\nTell the Spartans we lie\r\nLifeless at Thermopylae:\r\nDead at their word,\r\nObedient to their command.\r\nHave they heard? \r\nDo they understand?\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gulls in their high, lonely circuits may tell. \r\nMichael R. Burch, after Glaucus\r\n\r\nHere he lies in state tonight: great is his Monument!\r\nYet Ares cares not, neither does War relent. \r\nMichael R. Burch, after Anacreon\r\n\r\nThey observed our fearful fetters, braved the overwhelming darkness.\r\nNow we extol their excellence: bravely, they died for us.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Mnasalcas\r\n\r\nBlame not the gale, nor the inhospitable sea-gulf, nor friends tardiness,\r\nMariner! Just mans foolhardiness.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Leonidas of Tarentum\r\n\r\nBe ashamed, O mountains and seas: these were men of valorous breath.\r\nAssume, like pale chattels, an ashen silence at death.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Parmenio \r\n\r\nThese men earned a crown of imperishable glory,\r\nNor did the maelstrom of death obscure their story.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\r\n\r\nStranger, flee!\r\nBut may Fortune grant you all the prosperity\r\nshe denied me. \r\nMichael R. Burch, after Leonidas of Tarentum\r\n\r\nNow that I am dead sea-enclosed Cyzicus shrouds my bones.\r\nFaretheewell, O my adoptive land that nurtured me, that held me;\r\nI take rest at your breast.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Erycius\r\n\r\nI am loyal to you master, even in the grave:\r\nJust as you now are deaths slave.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Dioscorides\r\n\r\nStripped of her stripling, if asked, shed confess:\r\nI am now less than nothingness.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Diotimus\r\n\r\nDead as you are, though you lie\r\nstill as stone, \r\nhuntress Lycas,\r\nmy great Thessalonian hound,\r\nthe wild beasts still fear your white bones;\r\ncraggy Pelion remembers your valor,\r\nsplendid Ossa, the way you would bound\r\nand bay at the moon for its whiteness,\r\nbellowing\r\nas below we heard valleys resound.\r\nAnd how brightly with joy you would canter and run\r\nthe strange lonely peaks of high Cithaeron!\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Simonides\r\n\r\nHaving never earned a penny,\r\nnor seen a bridal gown slip to the floor,\r\nstill I lie here with the love of many,\r\nto be the love of yet one more.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after an unknown Greek poet\r\n\r\n\r\nI lie by stark Icarian rocks\r\nand only speak when the sea talks.\r\nPlease tell my dear father that I gave up the ghost\r\non the Aegean coast.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Theatetus\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere the sea is the sea, the dead are the dead.\r\nWhat difference to mewhere I rest my head?\r\nThe sea knows Im buried.\r\nMichael R. Burch, after Antipater of Sidon\r\n\r\nConstantina, inconstant one! \r\nOnce I thought your name beautiful \r\nbut I was a fool \r\nand now you are more bitter to me than death! \r\nYou flee someone who loves you \r\nwith baited breath \r\nto pursue someone whos untrue. \r\nBut if you manage to make him love you, \r\ntomorrow you\'ll flee him too! \r\nMichael R. Burch, \r\nafter Macedonius\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther translations of ancient Greek poetry by Michael R. Burch ...\r\n\r\nIbykos \r\nFragment 286, Circa 564 B.C.\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R.
