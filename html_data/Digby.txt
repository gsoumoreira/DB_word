The poems he left behind were said by future English poet laureate Robert Bridges to \r\nequal anything that was ever written by any English poet at his age. \r\nAccording to Simon Edge, author of The Hopkins Conundrum, Gerard Manley Hopkins was so captivated by a brief meeting [with Dolben] that he spent the rest of his \r\nlife mourning him. In a letter to Bridges after \r\nDolben\x92s death, Hopkins said there can very seldom have happened the loss of so \r\nmuch beauty (in body and mind and life) and of the promise of still more as \r\nthere has been in his case. Hopkins also asked Bridges whether Dolben\'s family \r\nhad considered publishing his poems. Fortunately, the independently wealthy \r\nBridges later published books of poems by both Dolben and Hopkins, or their \r\npoetry might have been lost to the world forever.\r\n\r\nIs Dolben merely a literary curiosity today because he attracted the attention \r\nof two famous poetswith possible homoerotic \r\nundertones on Hopkins\' partthen died so young \r\nand so tragically? Or does he merit consideration as a poet in his own right? \r\nAfterhis discovery ofthe prodigy\'s work thanks to Simon\'s novel, THT advisory \r\neditor Tom Merrillemailed Simonthat Dolben\'s precocity surprised mehow \r\nbeyond his years he was. I hope people know about him. He was a deeply sensitive \r\nperson, maybe comparable to Shelley. Another poet to whom Dolben may be \r\ncompared is Thomas Chatterton, the marvellous boy who died at age seventeen \r\nand yet was so highly esteemed by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats and Shelley. \r\n\r\nDolben\'s poems were published in a single volume by Bridges in 1911; \r\nthe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that his work stands among the \r\nbest of the poetry of the Oxford Movement. Dolben\'s death, it adds, was the end of a life of \r\nexceptional poetic promise. I agree and see no reason that such \r\nexceptional poetryall the more tantalizing because it was \r\nwritten at such a young ageshould not be read today. Toward that end, here are \r\nthe poems of Digby Dolben that strike me as his best, followed by three more \r\nthat, according to Bridges, exhibit complete mastery. The fourth such poem, in \r\nBridges\' opinion, is the first poem below.Michael R. \r\nBurch, editor, The HyperTexts\r\n\r\nThere is a Digby Dolben Timeline/Chronology at the bottom of this page, \r\nalong with a link to a very interesting Dolben bio written by Simon Edge. \r\n\r\nASong\r\n\r\nThe world is young today:\r\nForget the gods are old,\r\nForget the years of gold\r\nWhen all the months were May.\r\n\r\nA little flower of Love\r\nIs ours, without a root,\r\nWithout the end of fruit,\r\nYet  take the scent thereof.\r\n\r\nThere may be hope above,\r\nThere may be rest beneath;\r\nWe see them not, but Death\r\nIs palpable  and Love.\r\n\r\nFar Above The Shaken Trees\r\n\r\nFar above the shaken trees,\r\nIn the pale blue palaces,\r\nLaugh the high gods at their ease:\r\nWe with toss\xe8d incense woo them,\r\nWe with all abasement sue them,\r\nBut shall never climb unto them,\r\n\r\nNor see their faces.\r\n\r\nSweet my sister, Queen of Hades,\r\nWhere the quiet and the shade is,\r\nOf the cruel deathless ladies\r\nThou art pitiful alone.\r\nUnto thee I make my moan,\r\nWho the ways of earth hast known\r\n\r\nAnd her green places.\r\n\r\nFeed me with thy lotus-flowers,\r\nLay me in thy sunless bowers,\r\nWhither shall the heavy hours\r\nNever trail their hated feet,\r\nMaking bitter all things sweet;\r\nNevermore shall creep to meet\r\n\r\nThe perished dead.\r\n\r\nThere \'mid shades innumerable,\r\nThere in meads of asphodel,\r\nSleeping ever, sleeping well,\r\nThey who toiled and who aspired,\r\nThey, the lovely and desired,\r\nWith the nations of the tired\r\n\r\nHave made their bed.\r\n\r\nThere is neither fast nor feast,\r\nNone is greatest, none is least;\r\nTimes and orders all have ceased.\r\nThere the bay-leaf is not seen;\r\nClean is foul and foul is clean;\r\nShame and glory, these have been\r\n\r\nBut shall not be.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass away in fire,\r\nWhat is found beyond the pyre?\r\nSleep, the end of all desire.\r\nLo, for this the heroes fought;\r\nThis the gem the merchant bought,\r\nThis the seal of laboured thought\r\n\r\nAnd subtilty.\r\n\r\nBeyond\r\n\r\nBeyond the calumny and wrong,\r\nBeyond the clamour and the throng,\r\nBeyond the praise and triumph-song\r\n\r\nHe passed.\r\nBeyond the scandal and the doubt,\r\nThe fear within, the fight without,\r\nThe turmoil and the battle-shout\r\n\r\nHe sleeps.\r\n\r\nThe world for him was not so sweet\r\nThat he should grieve to stay his feet\r\nWhere youth and manhood\'s highways meet,\r\n\r\nAnd die.\r\nFor every child a mother\'s breast,\r\nFor every bird a guarded nest;\r\nFor him alone was found no rest\r\n\r\nBut this.\r\n\r\nBeneath the flight of happy hours,\r\nBeneath the withering of the flowers\r\nIn folds of peace more sure than ours\r\n\r\nHe lies.\r\nA night no glaring dawn shall break,\r\nA sleep no cruel voice shall wake,\r\nAn heritage that none can take\r\n\r\nAre his.\r\nFrom Martial\r\n\r\nIn vain you count his virtues up,\r\nHis soberness commend;\r\nI like a steady servant,\r\nBut not a steady friend.\r\n\r\nPoppies\r\n\r\n\r\nLilies, lilies not for me,\r\nFlowers of the pure and saintly\r\nI have seen in holy places\r\nWhere the incense rises faintly,\r\nAnd the priest the chalice raises,\r\nLilies in the altar vases,\r\n\r\nNot for me.\r\n\r\nLeave untouched each garden tree,\r\nKings and queens of flower-land.\r\nWhen the summer evening closes,\r\nLovers may-be hand in hand\r\nThere will seek for crimson roses,\r\nThere will bind their wreaths and posies\r\n\r\nMerrily.\r\n\r\nFrom the corn-fields where we met\r\nPluck me poppies white and red;\r\nBind them round my weary brain,\r\nStrew them on my narrow bed,\r\nNumbing all the ache and pain.\r\nI shall sleep nor wake again,\r\n\r\nBut forget.\r\n\r\nEnough\r\n\r\nWhen all my words were said,\r\nWhen all my songs were sung,\r\nI thought to pass among\r\nThe unforgotten dead,\r\n\r\nA Queen of ruth to reign\r\nWith her, who gathereth tears\r\nFrom all the lands and years,\r\nThe Lesbian maid of pain;\r\n\r\nThat lovers, when they wove\r\nThe double myrtle-wreath,\r\nShould sigh with mingled breath\r\nBeneath the wings of Love:\r\n\r\n\'How piteous were her wrongs,\r\nHer words were falling dew,\r\nAll pleasant verse she knew,\r\nBut not the Song of songs.\'\r\n\r\nYet now, O Love, that you\r\nHave kissed my forehead, I\r\nHave sung indeed, can die,\r\nAnd be forgotten too.\r\n\r\nThere Was One Who Walked In Shadow\r\n\r\nThere was one who walked in shadow,\r\n There was one who walked in light:\r\nBut once their way together lay,\r\n Where sun and shade unite,\r\n\r\nIn the meadow of the lotus,\r\n In the meadow of the rose,\r\nWhere fair with youth and clear with truth\r\n The Living River flows.\r\n\r\nScarcely summer stillness breaking,\r\n Questions, answers, soft and low\x97\r\nThe words they said, the vows they made,\r\n None but the willows know.\r\n\r\nBoth have passed away for ever\r\n From the meadow and the stream;\r\nPast their waking, past their breaking\r\n The sweetness of that dream.\r\n\r\nOne along the dusty highway\r\n Toiling counts the weary hours,\r\nAnd one among its shining throng\r\n The world has crowned with flowers.\r\n\r\nSometimes perhaps amid the gardens,\r\n Where the noble have their part,\r\nThough noon\'s o\'erhead, a dew-drop\'s shed\r\n Into a lily\'s heart.\r\n\r\nThis I know, till one heart reaches\r\n Labour\'s sum, the restful grave,\r\nWill still be seen the willow-green,\r\n And heard the rippling wave.\r\n\r\nA Sea Song\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days before the high tide\r\nSwept away the towers of sand\r\nBuilt with so much care and labour\r\nBy the children of the land,\r\n\r\nPale, upon the pallid beaches,\r\nThirsting, on the thirsty sands,\r\nEver cried I to the Distance,\r\nEver seaward spread my hands.\r\n\r\nSee, they come, they come, the ripples,\r\nSinging, singing fast and low,\r\nMeet the longing of the sea-shores,\r\nClasp them, kiss them once, and go.\r\n\r\n\'Stay, sweet Ocean, satisfying\r\nAll desires into rest\x97\'\r\nNot a word the Ocean answered,\r\nRolling sunward down the west.\r\n\r\nThen I wept: \'Oh, who will give me\r\nTo behold the stable sea,\r\nOn whose tideless shores for ever\r\nSounds of many waters be?\'\r\n\r\nMethought, Through Many Years And Lands\r\n\r\nMethought, through many years and lands,\r\nI sped along an arrowy flood,\r\nThat leapt and lapt my face and hands,\r\nI knew not were it fire or blood.\r\n\r\nI saw no sun in any place;\r\nA ghastly glow about me spread,\r\nUnlike the light of nights and days,\r\nFrom out the depth where writhe the dead.\r\n\r\nI passedtheir fleshless arms uprose\r\nTo draw me to the depths beneath:\r\nMy eyes forgot the power to close,\r\nAs other men\'s, in sleep or death.\r\n\r\nI saw the end of every sin;\r\nI weighed the profit and the cost;\r\nI felt Eternity begin,\r\nAnd all the ages of the lost.\r\n\r\nThe Crucifix was on my breast;\r\nI pressed the nails against my side;\r\nAnd unto Him, Who knew no rest\r\nFor thirty years, I turned and cried:\r\n\r\n\'Sweet Lord! I say not, give me ease;\r\nDo what Thou wilt, Thou doest good;\r\nAnd all Thy saints went up to peace,\r\nIn crowns of fire or robes of blood.\'\r\n\r\nWe hurry on, nor passing note\r\n\r\nWe hurry on, nor passing note\r\nThe rounded hedges white with May;\r\nFor golden clouds before us float\r\nTo lead our dazzled sight astray.\r\nWe say, \'they shall indeed be sweet\r\n\'The summer days that are to be\'\x97\r\nThe ages murmur at our feet\r\nThe everlasting mystery.\r\n\r\nWe seek for Love to make our own,\r\nBut clasp him not for all our care\r\nOf outspread arms; we gain alone\r\nThe flicker of his yellow hair\r\nCaught now and then through glancing vine,\r\nHow rare, how fair, we dare not tell;\r\nWe know those sunny locks entwine\r\nWith ruddy-fruited asphodel.\r\n\r\nA little life, a little love,\r\nYoung men rejoicing in their youth,\r\nA doubtful twilight from above,\r\nA glimpse of Beauty and of Truth,\x97\r\nAnd then, no doubt, spring-loveliness\r\nExpressed in hawthorns white and red,\r\nThe sprouting of the meadow grass,\r\nBut churchyard weeds about our head.\r\n\r\nHomo Factus Est\r\n\r\nCome to me, Belov\xe8d,\r\nBabe of Bethlehem;\r\nLay aside Thy Sceptre\r\nAnd Thy Diadem.\r\n\r\nCome to me, Belov\xe8d;\r\nLight and healing bring;\r\nHide my sin and sorrow\r\nUnderneath Thy wing.\r\n\r\nBid all fear and doubting\r\nFrom my soul depart,\r\nAs I feel the beating\r\nOf Thy Human Heart.\r\n\r\nLook upon me sweetly\r\nWith Thy Human Eyes\r\nWith Thy Human Finger\r\nPoint me to the skies.\r\n\r\nSafe from earthly scandal\r\nMy poor spirit hide\r\nIn the utter stillness\r\nOf Thy wounded Side.\r\n\r\nGuide me, ever guide me,\r\nWith Thy pierc\xe8d Hand,\r\nTill I reach the borders\r\nOf the pleasant land.\r\n\r\nThen, my own Belov\xe8d,\r\nTake me home to rest;\r\nWhisper words of comfort;\r\nLay me on Thy Breast.\r\n\r\nShow me not the Glory\r\nRound about Thy Throne;\r\nShow me not the flashes\r\nOf Thy jewelled Crown.\r\n\r\nHide me from the pity\r\nOf the Angels\' Band,\r\nWho ever sing Thy praises,\r\nAnd before Thee stand.\r\n\r\nHide me from the glances\r\nOf the Seraphin,\r\nThey, so pure and spotless,\r\nI, so stained with sin.\r\n\r\nHide me from St. Michael\r\nWith his flaming sword:\r\nThou can\'st understand me,\r\nO my Human Lord!\r\n\r\nJesu, my Belov\xe8d,\r\nCome to me alone;\r\nIn Thy sweet embraces\r\nMake me all Thine own.\r\n\r\nBy the quiet waters,\r\nSweetest Jesu, lead;\r\n\'Mid the virgin lilies,\r\nPurest Jesu, feed.\r\n\r\nOnly Thee, Belov\xe8d,\r\nOnly Thee, I seek.\r\nThou, the Man Christ Jesus,\r\nStrength in flesh made weak.\r\nSister Death\r\n\r\nMy sister Death! I pray thee come to me\r\nOf thy sweet charity,\r\nAnd be my nurse but for a little while;\r\nI will indeed lie still,\r\nAnd not detain thee long, when once is spread,\r\nBeneath the yew, my bed:\r\nI will not ask for lillies or for roses;\r\nBut when the evening closes,\r\nJust take from any brook a single knot\r\nOf pale Forget-me-not,\r\nAnd lay them in my hand, until I wake,\r\nFor his dear sake;\r\n(For should he ever pass and by me stand,\r\nHe might understand) \r\nThen heal the passion and the fever\r\nWith one cool kiss, for ever.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The poems above are, in my personal opinion, the best poems by Digby \r\nDolben. The poems below were named by Robert Bridges as the most masterful of \r\nDolben\'s poems. The only poem on which we agreed was A Song, the first poem on \r\nthis page.  Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nFrom Sappho\r\n\r\n\r\nThou liest dead,lie on: of thee\r\nNo sweet remembrances shall be,\r\nWho never plucked Pierian rose,\r\nWho never chanced on Anter\xf4s.\r\nUnknown, unnoticed, there below\r\nThrough Aides\' houses shalt thou go\r\nAlone,for never a flitting ghost\r\nShall find in thee a lover lost.\r\n\r\nThe Shrine  \r\n\r\nThere is a shrine whose golden gate\r\nWas opened by the Hand of God;\r\nIt stands serene, inviolate,\r\nThough millions have its pavement trod;\r\nAs fresh, as when the first sunrise\r\nAwoke the lark in Paradise.\r\n\r\n\'Tis compassed with the dust and toil\r\nOf common days, yet should there fall\r\nA single speck, a single soil\r\nUpon the whiteness of its wall,\r\nThe angels\' tears in tender rain\r\nWould make the temple theirs again.\r\n\r\nWithout, the world is tired and old,\r\nBut, once within the enchanted door,\r\nThe mists of time are backward rolled,\r\nAnd creeds and ages are no more;\r\nBut all the human-hearted meet\r\nIn one communion vast and sweet.\r\n\r\nI enterall is simply fair,\r\nNor incense-clouds, nor carven throne\r\nBut in the fragrant morning air\r\nA gentle lady sits alone;\r\nMy motherah! whom should I see\r\nWithin, save ever only thee?\r\n\r\nHe Would Have His Lady Sing\r\n\r\nSing me the men ere this\r\nWho, to the gate that is\r\nA cloven pearl uprapt,\r\nThe big white bars between\r\nWith dying eyes have seen\r\nThe sea of jasper, lapt\r\nAbout with crystal sheen;\r\n\r\nAnd all the far pleasance\r\nWhere link\xe8d Angels dance,\r\nWith scarlet wings that fall\r\nMagnifical, or spread\r\nMost sweetly over-head,\r\nIn fashion musical,\r\nOf cadenced lutes instead.\r\n\r\nSing me the town they saw\r\nWithouten fleck or flaw,\r\nAflame, more fine than glass\r\nOf fair Abbayes the boast,\r\nMore glad than wax of cost\r\nDoth make at Candlemas\r\nThe Lifting of the Host:\r\n\r\nWhere many Knights and Dames,\r\nWith new and wondrous names,\r\nOne great Laudat\xe9 Psalm\r\nGo singing down the street;\r\n\'Tis peace upon their feet,\r\nIn hand \'tis pilgrim palm\r\nOf Goddes Land so sweet:\r\n\r\nWhere Mother Mary walks\r\nIn silver lily stalks,\r\nStar-tir\xe8d, moon-bedight;\r\nWhere Cecily is seen,\r\nWith Dorothy in green,\r\nAnd Magdalen all white,\r\nThe maidens of the Queen.\r\n\r\nSing onthe Steps untrod,\r\nThe Temple that is God,\r\nWhere incense doth ascend,\r\nWhere mount the cries and tears\r\nOf all the dolorous years,\r\nWith moan that ladies send\r\nOf durance and sore fears:\r\n\r\nAnd Him who sitteth there,\r\nThe Christ of purple hair,\r\nAnd great eyes deep with ruth,\r\nWho is of all things fair\r\nThat shall be, or that were,\r\nThe sum, and very truth.\r\nThen add a little prayer,\r\n\r\nThat since all these be so,\r\nOur Liege, who doth us know,\r\nWould fend from Sathanas,\r\nAnd bring us, of His grace,\r\nTo that His joyous place:\r\nSo we the Doom may pass,\r\nAnd see Him in the Face.\r\n\r\nFor a brief bio of Digby Dolben by Simon Edge, please click here:\r\nDigby Dolben Bio.\r\n\r\nDigby Dolben Chronology/Timeline\r\n\r\n1772: According to Louisa May Portman, the niece of George Digby Wingfield \r\nDigby, their ancestor Elizabeth Digby, later Lady Dolben, was an especial \r\nfavourite of the poet Alexander Pope. \r\n\r\n1848: Digby Augustus Stewart Mackworth Dolben is born on \r\nFebruary 8, 1848 on the English Channel island of Guernsey. His father, William Harcourt Isham \r\nMackworth (1806-1872), a younger son of Sir Digby Mackworth, the 3rd Baronet, \r\ntakes the additional surname Dolben after he marries Frances, the heiress of Sir \r\nJohn English Dolben, the 4th Baronet.\r\n\r\n1853: While the young Digby Dolben is growing up in the Finedon parish of \r\nNorthamptonshire, Gerard Manley Hopkins\' future spiritual mentor, Henry Parry \r\nLiddon, is briefly in charge of the parish. Dolben attends Cheam School, whose \r\nalumni include Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Randolph Churchill (the father \r\nof Winston Churchill). \r\n\r\n1862: Digby Dolben enters Eton College around age fourteen, where he studies \r\nunder the influential Master William Johnson Cory, whose collection of verses \r\nIonica would influence his own poetry. At Eton, Dolben\'s distant cousin Robert \r\nBridges is his senior and takes him under his wing. According to Bridges, his \r\ncousin was tall and pale, with delicate features and an abstracted manner that \r\nmade him seem like a different species from the other students. \r\nFurthermore, he had a \r\nspirit of mischief as wanton as Shelley\'s. The rugged Bridges and the delicate \r\nDolben were very different animals, but they shared passions for poetry and \r\nreligion (Bridges called them both high church boys). \r\n\r\n1863: Dolben causes considerable scandal at Eton with his eccentric, \r\nexhibitionist behavior. He writes love poems to another pupil, Martin Le Marchant \r\nGosselin, whom Bridges later dubs Archie to keep his identity secret. \r\nDolben also \r\ndefies his strict Protestant upbringing by joining a High Church Puseyite group \r\nof pupils. He claims allegiance to the Order of St. Benedict, affects a \r\nmonk\'s habit, traipses around barefoot, and employs the signature Dominic. He also considers a \r\nconversion to Roman Catholicism, which his family considers beyond the pale. Around this time Dolben destroys \r\nall his poems by burning them, in what Bridges calls a holocaust. (The love \r\npoems to Archie are posited by Bridges as a reason for the holocaust, but \r\nthen why \r\nwere all the other poems destroyed?) Bridges leaves Eton for Oxford in July 1863. On \r\nJuly 30, Dolben is dismissed from Eton for a period of time, after engaging in a \r\nsecret meeting with Jesuits. Bridges and Dolben begin to correspond by letter on \r\nAugust 1. (Bridges would publish a number of these letters in 1911, \r\nproviding us with a good bit of historical information about Dolben.) In late \r\n1863 there was no sign of any Dolben poems being written since the holocaust, \r\naccording to Bridges.\r\n\r\n1864: In early 1864, Dolben is fasting and stealing \r\nthe breakfast rolls of other students, apparently to introduce them to the joys \r\nof fasting! According to Bridges, Dolben resumes writing poetry around Lent. \r\n(This means all Dolben\'s published poems were written in less than three \r\nyears.) Dolben announces that he is now Brother Dominic. He is writing religious \r\npoetry and expressing hopes of entering Oxford, but alas his Greek is not up to \r\nsnuff and he is constantly in search of tutors. Homo Factus Est may be Dolben\'s \r\nfirst mature poem. According to Bridges, William Cory crows that the poem is better \r\nthan Newman (i.e., the celebrated Cardinal John Henry Newman, a leading figure \r\nof the Oxford Movement). Six of Dolben\'s poems are published in the Union \r\nReview. Not bad for a sixteen-year-old! \r\n\r\n1865: On his seventeenth birthday, Dolben is introduced by Bridges, now an \r\nundergraduate at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to Gerard Manley Hopkins, a \r\nstudent at Balliol. According to Hopkins biographer Norman White, this encounter \r\ngreatly perturbs Hopkins. Another biographer, Robert Bernard Martin, asserts \r\nthat Hopkins\' meeting with Dolben is quite \r\nsimply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, \r\nprobably of his entire life. Hopkins is apparently smitten with Dolben and \r\nhis diary details his suppressed erotic \r\nthoughts about the younger poet. Hopkins keeps up a correspondence with Dolben and composes two poems about \r\nhim: Where art thou friend and \r\nThe Beginning of the End. Hopkins\' High Anglican confessor seems to have \r\nforbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. According to \r\nBridges, the quality of Dolben\'s poems begins to mature in 1865 as he turns \r\nincreasingly from Christianity to a Greek or pagan idea of beauty.\r\n\r\n1866: By this time, now living at Boughrood and studying under Henry de Winton \r\nfor the Oxford entrance exams, Doblen is writing poems of rarest attainment, \r\naccording to Bridges.\r\n\r\n1867: Dolben faints during his Oxford entrance exams on May 2, 1867 and fails. On June 15 he travels to meet a new tutor. Thirteen days later, \r\nDolben drowns in the River Welland (actually, a sluggish brook) on June 28, 1867 \r\nwhile bathing with the ten-year-old son of his new tutor, C. E. Prichard, Rector \r\nof South Luffenham. Dolben is only nineteen at the time. Did he have another \r\nfainting spell? Did he commit suicide, out of despair? Was it a tragic accident? \r\nA possible clue: Prichard wrote that Dolben was very pale and might have \r\nlooked in ill health. After his death, W. B. Gamlen, Secretary of the Oxford \r\nUniversity Chest, recollected Dolben\'s distinguished appearance, and the dreamy \r\nfar-away look in his eyes. Gamlen concluded that at Luffenham he had been in \r\nconstant contact with a highly-cultivated intelligence beyond his ability to \r\nappraise. \r\n\r\n1911: Robert Bridges, poet laureate from 1913 to 1930, edits and publishes a \r\nbook \r\nof Dolben\'s verse, Poems.\r\n\r\n1932: Bridges includes Dolben in Three Friends: Memoirs of Digby Mackworth \r\nDolben, Richard Watson Dixon, Henry Bradley. \r\n\r\n1981: The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848\x961867 is \r\npublished. \r\n\r\n2017: Hopkins\' infatuation for Dolben and Dolben\'s poetry and tragic death feature in Simon \r\nEdge\'s novel The Hopkins Conundrum.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
