Burch\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant, indeed, while the summer lasts\r\nwith the mild pheasants\' song ...\r\nbut now I feel the northern wind\'s blast\r\nits severe weather strong. \r\nAlas! Alas! This night seems so long!\r\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\r\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is one of the very best short lyrics in the early \r\nEnglish stable. At the time this ancient poem was \r\ncomposed, printed books, eyeglasses, mechanical clocks,\r\ncompasses and firearms either did not exist in Europe, or were \r\nrecently-invented novelties. And the flush toilet was just a pipe dream \r\n(pardon the pun)! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 58\r\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPain\r\ndrains\r\nme\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nlast\r\ndrop\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShattered\r\n\r\nbyVera Pavlova, a Russian poet\r\ntranslation by\r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nI shattered your heart;\r\nnow I limp through the shards\r\nbarefoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMirror\r\nby Kajal Ahmad, a Kurdish poet \r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe obscuring mirror of my era \r\nbroke \r\nbecause it magnified the small \r\nand made the great seem insignificant. \r\nDictators and monsters monopolized its maze. \r\nNow when I breathe \r\nits jagged shards pierce my heart \r\nand instead of sweat \r\nI exude glass. \r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n      Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\n    The day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\n    And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\n    Despair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\n    Broods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\n    Laughter or tears, for we have only known\r\n    Surpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\n    Have driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\n    Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\n    To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\n    Find end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\n    Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\n    Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\n    Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\nErnest\r\nDowson\'s influence on the English language and other writers can be seen in phrases \r\nhe coined like \r\n"gone with the wind" and "the days of wine and roses." His work \r\ncertainly influenced T. S. \r\nEliot, who said that certain lines by Dowson "have always run in my head."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother: Upon a Child\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nHere a pretty baby lies \r\nSung asleep with lullabies: \r\nPray be silent, and not stir \r\nTh\' easy earth that covers her. \r\n\r\nRobert Herrick\'s lovely, touching poem is a cross between a lullaby and an \r\nelegy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe Herrick\'s poem may have been inspired or influenced by the lovely, \r\ntouching epigram of an ancient poet:\r\n\r\nLie lightly on her, turf and dew ...\r\nShe put so little weight on you.\r\nMarcus Valerius Martial\r\n\r\nThe lines above appear in a poem Martial wrote for a slave girl, Erotion, who died six days short of her sixth birthday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAthenian Epitaphs\r\n\r\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\r\nbut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\r\nPlato, translation by  \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\r\nOnly the sea gulls in their high, lonely circuits may tell. \r\nGlaucus,\r\ntranslation by \r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPasserby, \r\ntell the Spartans we lie\r\nhere, dead at their word,\r\nobedient to their command.\r\nHave they heard? \r\nDo they understand?\r\nSimonides,\r\ntranslation by \r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow that I am dead sea-enclosed Cyzicus shrouds my bones.\r\nFaretheewell, O my adoptive land that nurtured me, that held me;\r\nI take rest at your breast.\r\nErycius,\r\ntranslation by \r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe epitaphs the ancient Greeks left engraved on their tombstones are the \r\nliterary ancestors of our modern epigrams. The four epitaphs above are from a \r\ncollection of loose translations of mine called Athenian Epitaphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRondel\r\nby Kevin N. \r\nRoberts\r\n\r\nOur time has passed on swift and careless feet,\r\nWith sighs and smiles and songs both sad and sweet.\r\nOur perfect hours have grown and gone so fast,\r\nAnd these are things we never can repeat.\r\nThough we might plead and pray that it would last,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nLike shreds of mist entangled in a tree,\r\nLike surf and sea foam on a foaming sea,\r\nLike all good things we know can never last,\r\nToo soon we\'ll see the end of you and me.\r\nDespite the days and realms that we amassed,\r\nOur time has passed.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting poem, not only because it\'s sad and lovely, but because \r\nthe poet, Kevin Nicholas Roberts, claimed to be the reincarnation of Algernon \r\nCharles Swinburne! And it was Swinburne who introduced the rondel to English \r\npoetry, adapting it from the French rondeau.

Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully moving poem about memories of a lost childhood. Man is a \r\nnostalgic animal, and in this poem D. H. Lawrence captures the very essence of \r\nnostalgia . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music by \r\nConrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nConrad Aiken reminds us of the totality of loss we experience in the death of a \r\nloved one. How can we ever really and truly accept the fact that someone beautiful and wise is no \r\nmore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n"I am not as I was under the reign of the good Cynara"Horace\r\n\r\n      Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n    \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n    \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson wrote a small handful of poems that are among the strongest in the \r\nEnglish language. I consider him to be one of the very best unknown or \r\nunder-known major poets, along with Louise Bogan, who has the next poem coming \r\nup, below ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherds crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for musics cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beats too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is a major poet, in my opinion. Hopefully the rest of the reading \r\nworld will soon catch on. Please be sure to read her other poems on this page, \r\nespecially "After the Persian."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nThis is a deliciously scary poem about human alienation. It seems we can be not \r\nonly alienated from each other, but even from ourselves. Madness ran in Frost\'s \r\nfamily, along with a dark Calvinism, and yet he also wrote one of the loveliest, \r\ntenderest love poems in the English language, To Earthward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong \r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti, in her strongest poems, is one of the best of the Romantics, \r\nand a stronger poet than her more famous brother, the poet/painter Dante Gabriel \r\nRossetti. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrel Man\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nAnd my throat\r\nIs deep with song,\r\nYou did not think\r\nI suffer after\r\nI\'ve held my pain\r\nSo long.\r\n\r\nBecause my mouth\r\nIs wide with laughter\r\nYou do not hear\r\nMy inner cry:\r\nBecause my feet\r\nAre gay with dancing,\r\nYou do not know\r\nI die.\r\n\r\nLangston Hughes was perhaps the greatest American voice of black despair, in \r\nliterary circles, in the dark days of Jim Crow laws, kangaroo courts and legal \r\nracial discrimination in the United States. In other poems, he predicted that \r\nthings would change for the better, and perhaps in part due to his courage and \r\ntalent, they eventually did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Will Come Soft Rains\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nThere will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,\r\nAnd swallows circling with their shimmering sound;\r\n\r\nAnd frogs in the pools, singing at night,\r\nAnd wild plum trees in tremulous white,\r\n\r\nRobins will wear their feathery fire,\r\nWhistling their whims on a low fence-wire;\r\n\r\nAnd not one will know of the war, not one\r\nWill care at last when it is done.\r\n\r\nNot one would mind, neither bird nor tree,\r\nIf mankind perished utterly;\r\n\r\nAnd Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,\r\nWould scarcely know that we were gone.\r\n\r\nThis is a scary poem: what if no one will miss us when we\'re gone? Will the \r\nuniverse not regret having lost a poet as talented as Sara Teasdale? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt from The Sunlight on the Garden\r\nby Louis MacNeice \r\n\r\nThe sunlight on the garden\r\nHardens and grows cold,\r\nWe cannot cage the minute\r\nWithin its nets of gold,\r\nWhen all is told\r\nWe cannot beg for pardon.\r\n\r\nThis excerpt from The Sunlight on the Garden by Louis MacNeice strikes me as a \r\nperfect piece of poetry: very tender and very sad. It reminds me of Nothing \r\nGold Can Stay by Robert Frost, another perfect or near-perfect poem with a \r\nsimilar theme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully simple poem, but hardly simplistic. Many poets raptly \r\npraise God and Nature, but Robert Frost seems too honest and wise for such \r\nshenanigans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong from \xc6lla: Under the Willow Tree, or, Minstrel\'s Roundelay\r\nby\r\n\r\nThomas Chatterton\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSee! the white moon shines on high; \r\nWhiter is my true-love\'s shroud:\r\nWhiter than the morning sky, \r\nWhiter than the evening cloud: \r\nMy love is dead, \r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWould it surprise you to know that one of the saddest poems in the English \r\nlanguage was written by a child prodigy, Thomas Chatterton? Although his mother \r\nand family considered him to be slow, around age seven the young Chatterton \r\ndiscovered an ancient book with illuminated capital letters, and he suddenly \r\nbecame intensely interested, quickly learned to read, and then began writing \r\npoems! By age ten he was a published poet. But many of the poems he wrote were \r\nin a medieval version of English, and no one would believe that a child was \r\ncapable of writing such poems. So he pretended to have found the poems of an \r\nancient monk named Thomas Rowley. One thing led to another, and Chatterton was \r\naccused of being a forger even though the poems were his original \r\ncompositions! Spurned by stuffy literary types and unable to support himself, \r\nbut too proud to accept handouts, Chatterton committed suicide at age 17. You \r\ncan click on his hyperlinked name above to read the sad, lovely ballad above, \r\nand other poems that he wrote during his short, tortured life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrass\r\n\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\n\r\nPile the bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. \r\nShovel them under and let me work\r\nI am the grass; I cover all.\r\n\r\nAnd pile them high at Gettysburg\r\nAnd pile them high at Ypres and Verdun.\r\nShovel them under and let me work.\r\nTwo years, ten years, and the passengers ask the conductor:\r\nWhat place is this?\r\nWhere are we now?\r\n\r\nI am the grass.\r\nLet me work.\r\n\r\nCarl Sandburg is one of America\'s best-known penners of free verse. \r\nHere grass may refer to Walt Whitman\'s Leaves of Grass, in which the \r\nfirst American free verse poet suggests that if we want to find him after his \r\ndeath, we can look for him under our boot soles. While this is not \r\na poem about the Holocaust, per se, every time I read it, I am reminded of the \r\nmass graves discovered by Allied troops as they freed Europe from the Nazis. \r\nAlso, the similarity in sound of Austerlitz to Auschwitz creates an aural \r\nlink of sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Harvest Moon\r\nby Carl Sandburg\r\n\r\nUnder the harvest moon,\r\nWhen the soft silver\r\nDrips shimmering\r\nOver the garden nights,\r\nDeath, the gray mocker,\r\nComes and whispers to you\r\nAs a beautiful friend\r\nWho remembers.\r\n\r\nUnder the summer roses\r\nWhen the flagrant crimson\r\nLurks in the dusk\r\nOf the wild red leaves,\r\nLove, with little hands,\r\nComes and touches you\r\nWith a thousand memories,\r\nAnd asks you\r\nBeautiful, unanswerable questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nStyx\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBlack waters,\r\ndeep and dark and still . . .\r\nall men have passed this way,\r\nor will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Parting\r\nby William Jay Smith\r\n\r\nTime that is recorded is not now,\r\nNow when the train is leaving, and the clock\r\nIs hooded in the distance, when the heart cries: How\r\nCan you be leaving, for there is no time?\r\n\r\nSome delight in the journey, in the crossing\r\nOf accepted boundaries; you go\r\nKnowing you love what\'s left, yourself, your loss\r\nOf\r\n knowing the wheels will say, \r\nYou do not know.\r\n\r\nRain is falling, and there is no rest. \r\nWhere are there tears enough to drown the sun?\r\nLove also dies; the dead have loved you best:\r\nLook for them there in the dark where the rails run. \r\n\r\nWilliam Jay Smith probably remains unknown to 99.9% of the reading public. But \r\nhe was a talented poet who packed quite a punch, as the poems above and below \r\ndemonstrate ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\nby William Jay Smith\r\n\r\nTemptation, oh, temptation, sang the singers,\r\nAnd the river passed them by like Banquo\'s ghost.\r\nDeliver us from evil, and the river;\r\nAll are lost.\r\n\r\nSalvation, oh, salvation, sang the singers,\r\nAnd the ribs that rose and fell were barrel staves;\r\nAnd I saw beyond the mist, the magic circle,\r\nThe hungry waves.\r\n\r\nThe river like a serpent moved among them,\r\nAnd mingled, as it coiled upon each eye,\r\nThe faint, the dark, the scarcely flowing water,\r\nAnd the quiet sky.\r\n\r\nDeath-in-Life is on us, cried the people.\r\nLeaves from Birnam Wood are on the wind.\r\nHoly, holy, holy, sang the singers,\r\nAll have sinned.\r\n\r\nThe stars have disappeared above the city\r\nLike jewels from the crown of Banquo\'s ghost;\r\nAnd London Bridge is falling, falling, falling,\r\nScaled, and crossed.\r\n\r\nThis is another eerie, disturbing, frightening poem by William Jay Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\n"Luke Havergal" is like a ghost story in which the reader becomes one with the \r\nghost. When we recognize our affinity with the poem\'s protagonist, the poem \r\nbecomes all the more terrifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful poem by one of the very best early modern poets, Wilfred \r\nOwen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSea Fevers\r\nby Agnes Wathall\r\n\r\n\r\nNo ancient mariner I,\r\n Hawker of public crosses,\r\nSnaring the passersby\r\n With my necklace of albatrosses.\r\n\r\nI blink no glittering eye\r\n Between tufts of gray sea mosses\r\nNor in the high road ply\r\n My trade of guilts and glosses.\r\n\r\nBut a dark and inward sky\r\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\r\nNo more becalmed to lie,\r\n The skeleton ship tosses.\r\n\r\nWhile I\'m sure that few readers have heard of Agnes Wathall, her "Sea Fevers" is a poem that warrants reading and remembering. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Thomas More \r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More (aka Thomas Moore) was a gifted poet who became a saint of the Catholic Church. \r\nUnfortunately the penner of "Utopia" sometimes sent Protestant "heretics" \r\nto be burned at the stake. Small wonder we now call those forbidding days the \r\nDark Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lovemaker\r\n\r\nby Robert Mezey\r\n\r\nI see you in her bed,\r\nDark, rootless epicene,\r\nWhere a lone ghost is laid\r\nAnd other ghosts convene;\r\n\r\nAnd hear you moan at last\r\nYour pleasure in the deep\r\nHaven of her who kissed\r\nYour blind mouth into sleep.\r\n\r\nBut body, once enthralled,\r\nWakes in the chains it wore,\r\nDishevelled, stupid, cold,\r\nAnd famished as before,\r\n\r\nAnd hears its paragon\r\nBreathe in the ghostly air,\r\nAnonymous carrion\r\nRavished by despair.\r\n\r\nLovemaker, I have felt\r\nDesire take my part,\r\nBut lacked your constant fault\r\nAnd something of your art,\r\n\r\nAnd would not bend my knees\r\nTo the unmantled pride\r\nThat left you in that place,\r\nForever unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. Robert Mezey \r\nmanages to turn earthly love into an endlessly haunting ghost story. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Listeners \r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\r\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\r\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\r\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\r\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\r\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\r\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\r\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\r\nTo that voice from the world of men:\r\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\r\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\r\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\r\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\r\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\r\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\r\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\r\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\r\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\r\nLouder, and lifted his head:\r\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\r\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\r\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\r\nThough every word he spake\r\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\r\nFrom the one man left awake:\r\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\r\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\r\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\r\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite story poems. It rivals "The Highwayman" by Alfred \r\nNoyes as the best ghost story in English poetry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepths\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nOnce more home is a strange place: by the ocean a\r\nbig house now, and the small houses are memories,\r\n once live images, vacant\r\n thoughts here, sinking and vanishing.\r\n\r\nRough sea now on the shore thundering brokenly\r\ndraws back stones with a roar out into quiet and\r\n far depths, darkly to lie there\r\n years, yearsthere not a sound from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew waves out of the night\'s mist and obscurity\r\nlunge up high on the beach, spending their energy,\r\n each wave angrily dying,\r\n all shapes endlessly altering,\r\n\r\nyet out there in the depths nothing is modified.\r\nEarthquakes won\'t even moveno, nor the hurricane\r\n one stone there, nor a glance of\r\n sun\'s light stir its identity.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem by the contemporary poet Richard Moore, who \r\nlived in a dilapidated mansion close by the sea, until his death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from "More Poems,"\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nHere dead lie we because we did not choose\r\n  To live and shame the land from which we sprung.\r\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\r\n  But young men think it is, and we were young.\r\n\r\nThe poem above was the first ever to appear on the pages of The HyperTexts. \r\nThe darkness of poetry begins with the contemplation of death, and the \r\nrealization that death does not spare even the young, bold and courageous. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n\r\n"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" appears in Horace\'s Odes. \r\nThe "old lie" means:  "It is sweet and fitting\r\nto die for one\'s country." Wilfred Owen died just before the \r\narmistice that ended World War I. There\'s no telling what he might have \r\naccomplished if he had lived, but he left behind a good number of immortal \r\npoems: all of them penned within the short period of time between his enlistment \r\nand death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Mole\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nAvoid the reeking herd, \r\nShun the polluted flock, \r\nLive like that stoic bird, \r\nThe eagle of the rock. \r\n\r\nThe huddled warmth of crowds \r\nBegets and fosters hate; \r\nHe keeps above the clouds \r\nHis cliff inviolate. \r\n\r\nWhen flocks are folded warm, \r\nAnd herds to shelter run, \r\nHe sails above the storm, \r\nHe stares into the sun. \r\n\r\nIf in the eagle\'s track \r\nYour sinews cannot leap, \r\nAvoid the lathered pack, \r\nTurn from the steaming sheep. \r\n\r\nIf you would keep your soul \r\nFrom spotted sight or sound, \r\nLive like the velvet mole: \r\nGo burrow underground. \r\n\r\nAnd there hold intercourse \r\nWith roots of trees and stones, \r\nWith rivers at their source, \r\nAnd disembodied bones.\r\n\r\nThis is wonderfully scary poem by a poet who is under-known and \r\nunder-appreciated today. One can seldom trust the "advice" of poets. If I \r\napprehend the wily Wylie correctly, it seems she offers us three options: (1) the dubious \r\nwarmth of the reeking herd, (2) the alien loneliness of the aloof eagle, or (3) \r\nthe blind burrowing of the velvet mole. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nWhen T. S. Eliot began to write, modern poetry began to change. This is a \r\nwonderfully haunting poem about love unrealized, or only half realized . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarabande On Attaining The Age Of Seventy-Seven\r\n\r\nby Anthony Hecht\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harbingers are come. See, see their mark;\r\nWhite is their colour; and behold my head.\r\n-- George Herbert\r\n \r\n \r\nLong gone the smoke-and-pepper childhood smell\r\nOf the smoldering immolation of the year,\r\nLeaf-strewn in scattered grandeur where it fell,\r\nGolden and poxed with frost, tarnished and sere.\r\n \r\nAnd I myself have whitened in the weathers\r\nOf heaped-up Januaries as they bequeath\r\nThe annual rings and wrongs that wring my withers,\r\nSober my thoughts, and undermine my teeth.\r\n \r\nThe dramatis personae of our lives\r\nDwindle and wizen; familiar boyhood shames,\r\nThe tribulations one somehow survives,\r\nRise smokily from propitiatory flames\r\n \r\nOf our forgetfulness until we find\r\nIt becomes strangely easy to forgive\r\nEven ourselves with this clouding of the mind,\r\nThis cinerous blur and smudge in which we live.\r\n \r\nA turn, a glide, a quarter turn and bow,\r\nThe stately dance advances; these are airs\r\nBone-deep and numbing as I should know by now,\r\nDiminishing the cast, like musical chairs.\r\n\r\nHecht\'s poem makes aging seem like sitting in a foxhole, waiting for the \r\ninevitable end, but with the somewhat hopeful note that "it becomes strangely easy to forgive \r\n/ even ourselves with this clouding of the mind, / this cinerous blur and smudge in which we live." \r\nShould we thank God, perhaps, for small favors, like eroding memories? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died. \r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\nI suppose I shouldn\'t publish my own poems on such an auspicious page, but what \r\nthe hell: I think this one deserves to be read and considered. Christians and \r\nJews need to understand that when they do things that cause Muslim children to \r\nsuffer and die, the "golden rule" can come back to pursue them like an avenging \r\ndemon. What happens when we talk the talk, but don\'t walk the walk, and innocent \r\nwomen and children suffer and die as a result? Terrible things like 9-11 and \r\nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Why? Because Muslim men love and want to protect \r\ntheir women and children, just as Christian and Jewish men love and want to \r\nprotect their women and children. Until we understand this elemental truth, and \r\nrespect and honor it, we are doomed to repeat the errors of the past, which \r\nalways begin with with "chosen few" practicing injustices against their \r\n"inferiors," who quite understandably never agree with the beliefs of their "superiors."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens called the poet the "priest of the invisible." In this poem and \r\nin certain other poems of his, he seems to be the "priest of the nonexistent" \r\nwho takes "negative capability" to new heights (depths?). But his \r\nbest poems are wonders, whether or not one agrees with their conclusions, or understands \r\nthem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nDylan Thomas wrote this stunning poem for his dying father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s\r\n defunct\r\n who used to\r\n ride a watersmooth-silver\r\n stallion\r\n and break onetwothreefourfive \r\npigeonsjustlikethat\r\n \r\nJesus\r\n he was a handsome man\r\n and what i want to know is\r\n how do you like your blueeyed boy\r\n Mister Death\r\n\r\nCummings was perhaps the most whimsical of the major poets, but he was also \r\ncapable of savage irony, in poems like this one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n"The brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long\r\n    duration" Horace\r\n    \r\n    They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\n    Love and desire and hate:\r\n    I think they have no portion in us after\r\n    We pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\n    Out of a misty dream\r\n    Our path emerges for a while, then closes\r\n    Within a dream.\r\n\r\nDowson died at age 32 and is only known for a few poems today, but his best \r\npoems are highly memorable. He\'s one of my favorite lesser-known poets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby\r\nThomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\nWyatt\'s poem seems remarkably fresh and stunningly original today, although it \r\nwas one of the earliest-written sonnets in the English language. Wyatt was a \r\nladies\' man who may have had an affair with Anne Boleyn. His other\r\nbest-known poem, "Whoso \r\nList to Hunt," may have been written with her in mind. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  The Skeleton\'s Defense of Carnality\r\n\r\nby Jack Foley\r\n  \r\n  Truly I have lost weight, I have lost weight,\r\n  grown lean in loves defense,\r\n  in loves defense grown grave.\r\n  It was concupiscence that brought me to the state:\r\n  all bone and a bit of skin\r\n  to keep the bone within.\r\n  Flesh is no heavy burden for one possessed of little\r\n  and accustomed to its loss.\r\n  I lean to love, which leaves me lean, till lean turn into lack.\r\n  A wanton bone, I sing my song\r\n  and travel where the bone is blown\r\n  and extricate true love from lust\r\n  as any man of wisdom must.\r\n  Then wherefore should I rage\r\n  against this pilgrimage\r\n  from gravel unto gravel?\r\n  Circuitous I travel\r\n  from love to lack / and lack to lack,\r\n  from lean to lack\r\n  and back.\r\n\r\nI love this wicked little poem by the contemporary poet Jack Foley. The male \r\nskeleton is missing an important "member" required for lovemaking, so "lean" \r\nreally does "turn into lack" when the "bone is blown."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby\r\nT. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nThis poem (the poet is an atheist) seems like both an earnest, heartfelt prayer and a condemnation \r\nof religion\'s dubious "God" to me. Why doesn\'t God have compassion on fallen \r\nfledglings, one wonders? . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilly Nilly\r\nby\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor the Demiurge aka Yahweh/Jehovah\r\n\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days uphilly.\r\nThey ran till they dropped\r\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nThey say I should worship you!\r\nOh, really!\r\nThey say I should pray\r\nso youll not act illy.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\n\r\nWhile some aspiring intellectuals might turn up their noses at this poem of \r\nmine, sniffing and calling it "doggerel," I think it makes a point similar to \r\nTom Merrill\'s, in a humorous way. If God is all-loving, all-wise and all-just, \r\nwhy do people have to pray so diligently to him not to act unlovingly, unwisely and unjustly? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIIIfrom Sunday Morning\r\n\r\nby \r\nWallace Stevens\r\n\r\n\r\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\r\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\r\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\r\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\r\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\r\nOr old despondency of day and night,\r\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\r\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\r\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\r\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\r\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\r\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\r\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\r\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\r\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\r\n\r\nSunday Morning is one of the greatest poems in the English canon. The final \r\nstanza of Sunday Morning contrasts human faith and its revelations to nature \r\nand its ambiguities. As the pigeons sink downward to darkness, what can we make \r\nof the ambiguous undulations of their wings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nI believe Robert Hayden became an immortal poet with this poem. I wonder how \r\nmany children will read it and suddenly realize how much of their lives \r\ntheir parents sacrificed to their upbringing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan\'s Song \r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nWhen beauty breaks and falls asunder \r\nI feel no grief for it, but wonder. \r\nWhen love, like a frail shell, lies broken, \r\nI keep no chip of it for token. \r\nI never had a man for friend \r\nWho did not know that love must end. \r\nI never had a girl for lover \r\nWho could discern when love was over. \r\nWhat the wise doubt, the fool believes \r\nWho is it, then, that love deceives?\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully honest and ironical poem about love, from a woman\'s \r\nperspective. I believe Bogan may give men too much credit (most men are just as \r\nsusceptible to the myths of love as most women are), but perhaps it avails \r\nnothing for anyone to be "wise" in matters of love. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beachby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nThis may be the first truly great modern poem, along with "The Love Song of J. \r\nAlfred Prufrock" by T. S. Eliot. Matthew Arnold stopped writing poetry when he \r\ncould no longer "create joy," but this magnificent poem will \r\nundoubtedly remain a joy forever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nI believe this poem is a wonderful validation of the art and craft of the \r\nRomantic Poet, who writes for the sake of love, even if lovers misapprehend or \r\nignore him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nThis poem is a wonderful bit of commentary on the utter strangeness of human \r\nsocieties and their castes. How many of us long for companionship, but are \r\nreluctant to seek it below our station? Is it worse to be alone, or to associate \r\nwith our "inferiors"? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  Easter Hymn\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\nHousman is among the most direct and plainspoken of poets, and therefore among the \r\nvery strongest. He is also one of our best critics of human societies and \r\nreligion, along with Blake, Wilde, Whitman and a few others. Housman didn\'t \r\ncreate art for art\'s sake, but art for humanity\'s sake. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\nIf I remember things correctly, this poem was written at the close of the \r\nnineteenth century, perhaps to usher in the twentieth. If so, at least \r\nit closes on a somewhat hopeful note. Perhaps there is a Hope of which humanity \r\nis unaware, and which Religion (hopefully) misapprehends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\n"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"\r\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\nMany of the best poems are stories. This poem tells a compelling story in a \r\nmeter that seems both natural and effortless. Later poets like Wallace Stevens \r\nand Hart Crane would also manage to write poems that remained metrical without \r\ndescending into "sing-songy-ness." \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\nThis is a near-perfect loose translation of a poem by the French poet Ronsard. \r\nYeats no doubt wrote it with the love of his life, Maude Gonne, in mind. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\nYeats wrote this poem for Robert Gregory, the son of his patron, Lady Gregory. \r\nTo understand the pilot\'s dilemma, we have to understand that many Irishmen had \r\nno more love for their English conquerors than for their would-be German \r\nconquerors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls \r\nby e.\r\ne. cummings\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\nare unbeautiful and have comfortable minds\r\n(also, with the church\'s protestant blessings\r\ndaughters, unscented shapeless spirited)\r\nthey believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,\r\nare invariably interested in so many things\r\nat the present writing one still finds\r\ndelighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?\r\nperhaps.  While permanent faces coyly bandy\r\nscandal of Mrs. N and Professor D\r\n.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above\r\nCambridge if sometimes in its box of\r\nsky lavender and cornerless, the\r\nmoon rattles like a fragment of angry candy \r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem by e. e. cummings makes a number of interesting points about the role \r\nof religion in American society. Does Christianity result in "comfortable minds" \r\nable to simultaneously undertake small acts of charity, coyly bandy gossip, and \r\nignore the reality of a universe which is obviously not controlled by a loving, \r\ncompassionate, benevolent "God"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convergence Of The Twain by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nLines on the loss of the "Titanic"\r\n\r\nIn a solitude of the sea\r\nDeep from human vanity,\r\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\r\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\r\nOf her salamandrine fires,\r\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\r\nOver the mirrors meant\r\nTo glass the opulent\r\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\r\nJewels in joy designed\r\n To ravish the sensuous mind\r\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\r\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\r\n Gaze at the gilded gear\r\nAnd query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?"...\r\nWell: while was fashioning\r\n This creature of cleaving wing,\r\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\r\n Prepared a sinister mate\r\n For herso gaily great\r\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\r\n And as the smart ship grew\r\n In stature, grace, and hue,\r\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\r\n Alien they seemed to be;\r\n No mortal eye could see\r\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\r\n Or sign that they were bent\r\n By paths coincident\r\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\r\n Till the Spinner of the Years\r\n Said "Now!" And each one hears,\r\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThis is a near-perfect poem by one of the first modern masters. Hardy didn\'t \r\nseem to believe in a benevolent God, but in some sort of inexorable process of \r\nFate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not All \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof against the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and sink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breathNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making friends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be that in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor nagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love for peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I do not think I would.\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay wrote some damn strong poems, and should also be \r\nrecognized as one of the first female poets to write honestly (and perhaps \r\nsometimes brag) about the power of her sexuality over men. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution \r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nThis poem demonstrates how a poet can be made immortal by a single stellar poem. \r\nChidiock Tichborne was held prisoner in the Tower of London, then executed \r\nbefore his thirtieth birthday for allegedly plotting to murder Queen Elizabeth I \r\nand replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMouse\'s Nest \r\n\r\nby John Clare\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\r\nAnd progged it as I passed and went away;\r\nAnd when I looked I fancied something stirred,\r\nAnd turned again and hoped to catch the bird\r\nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheats\r\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats;\r\nShe looked so odd and so grotesque to me,\r\nI ran and wondered what the thing could be,\r\nAnd pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood;\r\nThen the mouse hurried from the craking brood.\r\nThe young ones squeaked, and as I went away\r\nShe found her nest again among the hay.\r\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\r\nAnd broad old cesspools glittered in the sun.\r\n\r\nJohn Clare does a good job of conveying the horror and humor of a chance \r\nencounter between a human being and a mother mouse with a bevy of baby mice \r\nhanging from her teats. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCold-Blooded Creatures\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nMan, the egregious egoist\r\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\r\nImagines, by some mental twist,\r\nThat he alone is sentient\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable load\r\nThat on all living creatures lies,\r\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\r\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\r\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\r\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\r\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\r\n\r\nThis is another scary poem by the wily Wylie. If the bent twig refers to the \r\ngarden of Eden myth, as I suspect, Wylie may be making the point that since \r\ncold-blooded creatures understand evil (death), man was taken to the cleaners by \r\nhis "god" or his religion, or both, since he got nothing of value from the \r\n"forbidden fruit." \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn My First Son\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\n      Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\r\n    My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\r\n    Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\r\n    Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\r\n    O, could I lose all father now! For why\r\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\r\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\r\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\r\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, "Here doth lie\r\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\r\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\r\n    As what he loves may never like too much."\r\n\r\nThis is a strong poem by a strong poet. While there are more flowery elegies, \r\nthere may never have been a more honest one. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthem For Doomed Youth\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nWhat passing-bells for these who die as cattle? \r\nOnly the monstrous anger of the guns. \r\nOnly the stuttering rifles\' rapid rattle \r\nCan patter out their hasty orisons. \r\nNo mockeries for them from prayers or bells, \r\nNor any voice of mourning save the choirs\r\nThe shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; \r\nAnd bugles calling for them from sad shires. \r\nWhat candles may be held to speed them all? \r\nNot in the hands of boys, but in their eyes \r\nShall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. \r\nThe pallor of girls\' brows shall be their pall; \r\nTheir flowers the tenderness of patient minds, \r\nAnd each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen is one of my favorite poets; no one has ever exceeded or even \r\nrivaled him as an anti-war poet. If the human race ever has the good sense to \r\nabandon war, Owen will have been one of the first causes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bustle In A House \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThe bustle in a house\r\nThe morning after death\r\nIs solemnest of industries\r\nEnacted upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping up the heart\r\nAnd putting love away\r\nWe shall not want to use again\r\nUntil eternity.\r\n\r\nWhile critics like Harold Bloom seem to love Emily Dickinson for her difficulty, \r\nI love this poem because it is so accessible and moving. When I\'m upset, I \r\nsometimes find myself suddenly tidying up things. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Melville\'s Tomb \r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nOften beneath the wave, wide from this ledge\r\nThe dice of drowned men\'s bones he saw bequeath\r\nAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,\r\nBeat on the dusty shore and were obscured.\r\n\r\nAnd wrecks passed without sound of bells,\r\nThe calyx of death\'s bounty giving back\r\nA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,\r\nThe portent wound in corridors of shells.\r\n\r\nThen in the circuit calm of one vast coil,\r\nIts lashings charmed and malice reconciled,\r\nFrosted eyes there were that lifted altars;\r\nAnd silent answers crept across the stars.\r\n\r\nCompass, quadrant and sextant contrive\r\nNo farther tides . . . High in the azure steeps\r\nMonody shall not wake the mariner.\r\nThis fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.\r\n\r\nCrane might have prophetically written "This fabulous shadow only the sea keeps" \r\nabout himself, since he committed suicide by leaping from the deck of an ocean \r\nliner into the Atlantic Ocean. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCirque d\'Hiver \r\n\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the floor flits the mechanical toy,\r\nfit for a king of several centuries back.\r\nA little circus horse with real white hair.\r\nHis eyes are glossy black.\r\nHe bears a little dancer on his back.\r\n\r\nShe stands upon her toes and turns and turns.\r\nA slanting spray of artificial roses\r\nis stitched across her skirt and tinsel bodice.\r\nAbove her head she poses\r\nanother spray of artificial roses.\r\n\r\nHis mane and tail are straight from Chirico.\r\nHe has a formal, melancholy soul.\r\nHe feels her pink toes dangle toward his back\r\nalong the little pole\r\nthat pierces both her body and her soul\r\n\r\nand goes through his, and reappears below,\r\nunder his belly, as a big tin key.\r\nHe canters three steps, then he makes a bow,\r\ncanters again, bows on one knee,\r\ncanters, then clicks and stops, and looks at me.\r\n\r\nThe dancer, by this time, has turned her back.\r\nHe is the more intelligent by far.\r\nFacing each other rather desperately\r\nhis eye is like a star\r\nwe stare and say, "Well, we have come this far."\r\n\r\nThis is another of Elizabeth Bishop\'s finely crafted poems, in which every image \r\nand word seem perfectly aligned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime in Eternity\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nWhen you were as an angel in my arms,\r\nHad laid your bare head just below my chin,\r\nYour length pressed up to mine, entrusting charms\r\nMy whole youth\'s starward longing could not win;\r\nWith still the murmur of your love in me,\r\nMiracle-tones of all my lifelong hope,\r\nI wished that there might start eternity\r\nAnd seal forever that sweet envelope;\r\nAnd as it did, my thoughts are now for you\r\nAs every star is blotted by the sun,\r\nAnd so the sun itself\r\nHas perished too,\r\nAnd with it, every dream of mine\r\nBut one.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully tender poem about love and loss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResume\r\nby \r\nDorothy Parker\r\n\r\nRazors pain you;\r\nRivers are damp;\r\nAcids stain you;\r\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\r\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\r\nNooses give;\r\nGas smells awful;\r\nYou might as well live.\r\n\r\nIt seems that for all man\'s inventiveness, particularly in matters of mayhem, he \r\nstill hasn\'t figured out a really good way to end his own existence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiem \r\nby Robert L. Stevenson\r\n\r\nUnder the wide and starry sky\r\nDig the grave and let me lie.\r\nGlad did I live and gladly die,\r\nAnd I laid me down with a will.\r\n\r\nThis be the verse you grave for me;\r\n"Here he lies where he longed to be,\r\nHome is the sailor, home from sea,\r\nAnd the hunter home from the hill."\r\n\r\nRobert L. Stevenson is better known as a novelist today, but he wrote one of the \r\nbetter epitaphs in the English language. It reminds me a bit of the epitaph \r\nWilliam Butler Yeats wrote for himself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving \r\nby George Gordon, Lord \r\nByron\r\n\r\nSo we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n So late into the night,\r\nThough the heart be still as loving,\r\n And the moon be still as bright.\r\n\r\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\r\n And the soul outwears the breast,\r\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\r\n And love itself have rest.\r\n\r\nThough the night was made for loving,\r\n And the day returns too soon,\r\nYet we\'ll go no more a-roving\r\n By the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nLord Byron is best known today for his madcap mock epic, "Don Juan," and his \r\nfamous love poem "She Walks in Beauty Like the Night," but this poem will do \r\nnicely for my purposes here. Like a number of the other Romantics, Byron died \r\nprematurely, perhaps before reaching the height of his powers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose \r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting if somewhat cryptic poem by one of the more mystical \r\npoets to have written in English. The rose is a symbol of love, so perhaps the \r\n"invisible worm" is the Invisible Friend of the black-robed priests that Blake \r\nso despised. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\n Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\n\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\n\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\n\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\n\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\n\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\n Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\n\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\n\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\n I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton went blind and dictated his later work to his daughters. When he \r\nsays that "day brought back my night," he is referring to his blindness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 147\r\n\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\r\n For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\r\n\r\nWhile I am not a great fan of Shakespeare\'s sonnets, preferring his songs and \r\nplays, I like the way he builds dramatic tension in this poem, to a fever pitch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be \r\n\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\r\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\r\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\r\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\r\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\r\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\r\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\r\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\r\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\r\nNever have relish in the faery power\r\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\r\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\r\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\r\nLike several other of the great Romantics, John Keats died at a young age. He \r\nleft behind a number of immortal poems, including this one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Persian \r\n\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to know \r\nThe depths of your terrible jungle: \r\nFrom what nest your leopard leaps \r\nOr what sterile lianas are at once your serpents\' disguise \r\n\r\nand home. \r\n\r\nI am the dweller on the temperate threshold, \r\nThe strip of corn and vine, \r\nWhere all is translucence (the light!) \r\nLiquidity, and the sound of water. \r\nHere the days pass under shade \r\nAnd the nights have the waxing and the waning moon. \r\nHere the moths take flight at evening; \r\nHere at morning the dove whistles and the pigeons coo. \r\nHere, as night comes on, the fireflies wink and snap \r\nClose to the cool ground, \r\nShining in a profusion \r\nCelestial or marine. \r\n\r\nHere it is never wholly dark but always wholly green, \r\nAnd the day stains with what seems to be more than the \r\n\r\nsun \r\nWhat may be more than my flesh. \r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI have wept with the spring storm; \r\n\r\nBurned with the brutal summer. \r\nNow, hearing the wind and the twanging bow-strings, \r\nI know what winter brings. \r\n\r\nThe hunt sweeps out upon the plain \r\nAnd the garden darkens. \r\nThey will bring the trophies home \r\nTo bleed and perish \r\nBeside the trellis and the lattices, \r\nBeside the fountain, still flinging diamond water, \r\nBeside the pool \r\n(Which is eight-sided, like my heart). \r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAll has been translated into treasure: \r\n\r\nWeightless as amber, \r\nTranslucent as the currant on the branch, \r\nDark as the rose\'s thorn. \r\n\r\nWhere is the shimmer of evil? \r\nThis is the shell\'s iridescence \r\nAnd the wild bird\'s wing. \r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIgnorant, I took up my burden in the wilderness. \r\nWise with great wisdom, I shall lay it down upon \r\nflowers. \r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nGoodbye, goodbye! \r\nThere was so much to love, I could not love it all; \r\nI could not love it enough. \r\n\r\nSome things I overlooked, and some I could not find. \r\nLet the crystal clasp them \r\nWhen you drink your wine, in autumn.\r\n\r\nThis has been one of my favorite poems since the day I first read it. It appears \r\nin a collection of poems by Louise Bogan entitled Blue Estuaries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirective by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\r\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\r\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\r\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\r\nThere is a house that is no more a house\r\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\r\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\r\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\r\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\r\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry \r\nGreat monolithic knees the former town\r\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\r\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\r\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\r\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\r\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\r\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\r\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\r\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\r\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\r\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\r\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\r\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\r\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\r\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\r\nThey think too much of having shaded out\r\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\r\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\r\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\r\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\r\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\r\nThe height of the adventure is the height\r\nOf country where two village cultures faded\r\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\r\nThis is a poem about a man\'s return to the darkness of his childhood \r\nreligion, Christianity. The guide who "only has at heart your getting lost" is \r\nthe endlessly strange "savior" of the gospels, who was able to save the thief on \r\nthe cross with a nod of his head, but for some incomprehensible reason declined \r\nto nod his head at everyone. Frost\'s "there\'s a story in a book about it" \r\nobviously refers to the Bible. When Frost says "You must not mind a certain coolness from him \r\n/\r\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain," he seems to be speaking of \r\nJesus Christ, who of course never speaks personally to the children who pray to \r\nhim. Frost\'s "put a sign up CLOSED to all but me" seems to refer to the idea \r\nthat only the "chosen few" will be saved. His "Weep for what little things could \r\nmake them glad" is one of the most poignant lines in English poetry. The "broken \r\ndrinking goblet like the Grail" may refer to the gospel, which is hidden from \r\nthe "wrong ones" so they "can\'t find it," according to Saint Mark. Frost\'s \r\nconclusion seems to be that one can only find himself by losing this terrible \r\ngospel, and so become "whole again beyond confusion." I wish Christian parents \r\nand pastors would read this poem and try to understand what the "good news" that \r\nJesus saves only the "chosen few" really means for innocent children who grow up \r\nunder the thumb of this dark, terrifying, unjust religion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad \r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep \r\nmonotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard \r\ndaylight steer.\r\n\r\nThe horror of Richard Wilbur\'s poem about a humble toad is that we see and \r\nrecognize ourselves in every line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer\r\n(Anonymous Ballad, circa 960 AD)\r\nloose translation by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game.\r\nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nThat island is fast, surrounded by fens.\r\nThere are fierce men on this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I wept, disconsolate,\r\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\r\nFor me, there was pleasure, but it also was painful.\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, it is not the lack of food\r\nbut my hunger for you, that makes me ill.\r\nYour infrequent visits have left me famished, deprived of real meat.\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sunder what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\n"Wulf and Eadwacer" is perhaps the first great English poem by a female poet, \r\nalthough it was written in a language closer to German than modern English. I \r\nwas never completely happy with the "updated" versions of the poem I was able to find, \r\nso I decided to translate it myself, borrowing heavily from the work of previous translators. The closing metaphor of a loveless sexual relationship being \r\nlike a song in which two voices never harmonized is stunning: one \r\nof the first great metaphors in the English poetic tradition. "Wulf and \r\nEadwacer" appeared in the Exeter Book, which has been dated at around 960 AD, \r\nbut the poem itself may be much older. Is it possible that the first truly great English \r\npoem was written by a woman?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCradle Song\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake managed to write a poem that is somewhat hopeful, and yet still \r\ndarker and scarier than hell. The fact that innocents sometimes suffer and die \r\nmakes the last line only half true, at best. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Her Surgery\r\nby Jack Butler\r\n\r\nI\r\nOver the city the moon rides in mist,\r\nscrim scarred with faint rainbow.\r\nTwo days till Easter.The thin clouds run slow, slow,\r\nthe wind bells bleed the quietest\r\nof possible musics to the dark lawn.\r\nAll possibility we will have children is gone.\r\n\r\nII\r\nI raise a glass half water, half alcohol,\r\nto that light come full again.\r\nInside, you sleep, somewhere below the pain.\r\nDown at the river, there is a tall\r\nghost tossing flowers to dark water\r\njessamine, rose, and daisy, salvia lyrata . . .\r\n\r\nIII\r\nOh goodbye, goodbye to bloom in the white blaze\r\nof moon on the river, goodbye\r\nto creek joining the creek joining the river, the axil, the Y,\r\ngoodbye to the Yes of two Ifs in one phrase . . .\r\nChildren bear children. We are grown,\r\nand time has thrown us free under the timeless moon.\r\n\r\nThis has long been one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. It\'s a \r\nwonderful poem about loss and the acceptance of loss, simply because there seems \r\nto be no alternative. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad \r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens succinctly explains man\'s existential dilemma: time will not \r\nrelent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\r\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\nMolest her ancient solitary reign. ...\r\n\r\nThe lines above are an excerpt from one of the best long poems in the English \r\nlanguage. This may be the best poem ever written in English, by an amazing poet \r\nwho has unfortunately become obscure, if not unknown to most readers.

Herman Melville dedicated his most \r\nfamous book, Moby-Dick, to Hawthorne. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo Have Loved\r\n\r\n\r\nby\r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe face that launched a thousand ships ...\r\n\r\nHelen, bright accompaniment,\r\naccouterment of war as sure as all\r\nthe polished swords of princes groomed to lie\r\nin mausoleums all eternity ... \r\nThe price of love is not so high\r\nas never to have loved once in the dark\r\nbeyond foreseeing. Now, as dawn gleams pale\r\nupon small wind-fanned waves, amid white sails, ... \r\nnow all that war entails becomes as small,\r\nas though receding. Paris in your arms\r\nwas never yours, nor were you his at all.\r\nAnd should gods call \r\nin numberless strange voices, should you hear,\r\nstill what would be the difference? Men must die\r\nto be remembered. Fame, the shrillest cry,\r\nleaves all the world dismembered. \r\nHold him, lie, \r\ntell many pleasant tales of lips and thighs;\r\nenthrall him with your sweetness, till the pall \r\nand ash lie cold upon him. \r\nIs this all? You saw fear in his eyes, and now they dim\r\nwith fears remembrance. Love, the fiercest cry,\r\nbecomes gasped sighs in his once-gallant hymn\r\nof dreamed salvation. Still, you do not care \r\nbecause you have this moment, and no man\r\ncan touch you as he can ... and when hes gone\r\nthere will be other men to look upon\r\nyour beauty, and have done. \r\nSmilewoebegone, pale, haggard. Will the tales\r\npaint thisyour final portrait? Can the stars\r\nfind any strange alignments, Zodiacs,\r\nto spell, or unspell, what held beauty lacks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoricos\r\nby Richard Aldington\r\n\r\nThe ancient songs \r\nPass deathward mournfully.\r\n\r\nCold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,\r\nRegretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings\r\nSymbols of ancient songs\r\nMournfully passing\r\nDown to the great white surges,\r\nWatched of none\r\nSave the frail sea-birds\r\nAnd the lithe pale girls,\r\nDaughters of Okeanos.\r\n\r\nAnd the songs pass\r\nFrom the green land\r\nWhich lies upon the waves as a leaf \r\nOn the flowers of hyacinth;\r\nAnd they pass from the waters,\r\nThe manifold winds and the dim moon,\r\nAnd they come,\r\nSilently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,\r\nTo the quiet level lands\r\nThat she keeps for us all,\r\nThat she wrought for us all for sleep\r\nIn the silver days of the earths dawning\r\nProsperine, daughter of Zeus. \r\n\r\nAnd we turn from the Kuprians breasts, \r\nAnd we turn from thee,\r\nPhoibos Apollon,\r\nAnd we turn from the music of old\r\nAnd the hills that we loved and the meads,\r\nAnd we turn from the fiery day,\r\nAnd the lips that were over-sweet;\r\nFor silently\r\nBrushing the fields with red-shod feet,\r\nWith purple robe\r\nSearing the flowers as with a sudden flame,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou hast come upon us. \r\n\r\nAnd of all the ancient songs\r\nPassing to the swallow-blue halls\r\nBy the dark streams of Persephone,\r\nThis only remains:\r\nThat in the end we turn to thee,\r\nDeath,\r\nThat we turn to thee, singing \r\nOne last song.\r\n\r\nO Death,\r\nThou art an healing wind\r\nThat blowest over white flowers\r\nA-tremble with dew;\r\nThou art a wind flowing\r\nOver long leagues of lonely sea;\r\nThou art the dusk and the fragrance;\r\nThou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;\r\nThou art the pale peace of one\r\nSatiate with old desires;\r\nThou art the silence of beauty,\r\nAnd we look no more for the morning;\r\nWe yearn no more for the sun, \r\nSince with thy white hands,\r\nDeath,\r\nThou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,\r\nThe slim colorless poppies\r\nWhich in thy garden alone\r\nSoftly thou gatherest.\r\n\r\nAnd silently;\r\nAnd with slow feet approaching;\r\nAnd with bowed head and unlit eyes, \r\nWe kneel before thee.\r\nAnd thou, leaning towards us, \r\nCaressingly layest upon us\r\nFlowers from thy thin cold hands,\r\nAnd, smiling as a chaste woman\r\nKnowing love in her heart,\r\nThou sealest our eyes\r\nAnd the illimitable quietude\r\nComes gently upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes the Dead\r\nby Michael R.
