She was one of the \nstudents who died at Columbine, but her words live on. In addition to Rachel\'s \npoetry, this page contains poems written by family members and other \npoets who mourned the senseless tragedy and celebrated her life and work. The movie\nI\'m Not Ashamed was based on her life and journal entries; it stars Masey \nMcLain as Rachel Joy Scott. \n\nI won\'t be labeled as average.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\n\nRelated pages: Sandy Hook Poems,\nAurora Poetry, \n\nSanta Fe Poems,\nColumbine Poems,\nCourtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\nDarfur Poems,\nGaza Poems,\nHaiti Poems, \nHiroshima Poems, \nHolocaust Poems,\nNakba Poems,\n911 Poems,\nTrail of Tears\n\n\n\n\nI have this theory \nthat if one person can go out of their way to show \ncompassion, \nthen it will start a chain reaction of the same. \nPeople will never \nknow how far a little kindness can go.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\nHere is an inspirational quote by Rachel Joy Scott that has not only become a \npoem, but a form of visual art:\n\nCompassion is the greatest form of love humans have to offer.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\n\n\nJust passing by \nJust coming through \nNot staying long \nI always knew \nThis home I have \nWould never last \nRachel Joy Scott\n\n\n\nBefore she died, Rachel Scott drew this haunting picture with thirteen tears \nthat may have prophesied her fate, and the fate of the other victims. But \nperhaps the rose being watered by the tears symbolizes love and compassion ... \ndid Rachel predict that her death and those of her friends would lead to a new \nflowering of love and compassion?\n\n\n\nRachel\'s Tears\n\nAccording to her family, Rachel loved blue butterflies. Here is a poem of \nmine that I have dedicated to her memory:\n\nFor Rachel Joy Scott, with Butterflies\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhere does the butterfly go\nwhen lightning rails, when thunder howls,\nwhen hailstones scream while winter scowls\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\nWhere does the butterfly go?\n\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\nWhen the only relief\'s a banked fire\'s glow,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\nand hope is lost without a trace?\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nHere is a poem of Rachel\'s that shows her independence and desire to chart her \nown path and destiny:\n\n\nCreate in me\nNothing. \nInvest in me \nNothing. \nI will create my own dream, \nmy own image, my own future. \nNo one else can do that for me.\nsigned Rachel Joy in her journal, in which she wrote immediately above the \npoem, in prose: I am my own responsibility. Feel no obligation, because I will \nbe no one\'s success story but my own.\n\nSpurred on in part by writings in the notebooks and diaries left behind by his \ndaughter, Darrell Scott  the son of an Episcopalian minister, though he himself \nis adamantly non-denominational  quit his job, set up a non-profit organization \ncalled The Columbine Redemption, and embarked on a grueling schedule of speaking \nengagements all across the United States to spread his message.\n\n\n\nOn May 2nd, Rachel wrote in her journal: This is my last year Lord. I have \ngotten what I can. Thank you. She also drew a picture, known as Rachels Tears; \nit has two eyes with thirteen tears falling down. Her parents believe that \nRachel somehow knew that she and twelve other people were going to die within a \nyear. \n\n\n\nDarrell Scott said: Rachel had a unique way of tilting her head to the side \nwhen she was thinking seriously. And I remember her beautiful smile. Rachel had \nan inward motivation to accomplish as much as possible. Whenever she sensed an \ninjustice being done to someone, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant \nit was, indignation rose up within her. She was always ready to stand up for \nanyone who she felt was mistreated. \n\n\n\nAccording to Dana Scott, Rachel\'s big sister, she had a great sense of humor. \nShe once recorded a voicemail on their home phone that said, You have reached \nQueen Rachel and her humble servants  please leave a message after the \nbeep.Her middle name, Joy, was truly one of the best ways to describe her \nfun-loving personality. \n\n\n\nRachel\'s Challenge was started by Rachel\'s dad and stepmom, Darrell and Sandy \nScott, when they realized that the writings and drawings Rachel left not only \nhad an impact on her friends and classmates, but also resonated with students \naround the world. Although Rachel was a typical teenager who wrote about her \nups and downs, she had a passion and conviction that she would someday change \nthe world. The Scott family knew her story and passion had to be told to inspire \nothers to make their world a better place. More than 18 million people have been \ntouched by Rachel\'s message, and they continue the legacy of making a difference \nin their communities. Each year at least two million more people are added to \nthat number. In one survey, 78% of students indicated they would definitely \nintervene in a bullying incident in their school after seeing Rachel\'s \nChallenge. In a recent 24 month period, Rachel\'s Challenge received more than \n450 emails from students who indicated that they changed their mind about taking \ntheir own life after hearing Rachel\'s Challenge. \n\n\n\nRachel\'s Challenge is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious organization \nbased in Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.\n\nThis lovely, touching poem was written for Rachel Joy Scott the night of her death, by her \ncousin and close friend Sarah Scott:\n\nAngel of Mine\nby Sarah Scott\n\nLooking down, seeing despair\nOnly leaving a soul searching for air\nFeeling the warmth, seeing the light\nReaching for wings for the eternal flight\nSlipping away from this world today\nAngel of mine you\'ve found your way.\nLet my love be the wind beneath your wing\nAs you rejoice in heaven and sing.\nAngel of mine\nYour face will make the heavens so bright\nWith your beauty, grace, and loving spirit.\n\nDarrell Scott is the father of Rachel Joy Scott, the first of the thirteen victims of the \nColumbine High School massacre. Rachel was a beautiful 17-year-old girl, and an \naspiring writer and actress. Her father wrote the poetic lines below four days before \nspeaking to Congress on the subject of the mass killings of students and \nteachers, the role of the NRA, and gun control:\n\nYour laws ignore our deepest needs\nYour words are empty air.\nYou\'ve stripped away our heritage.\nYou\'ve outlawed simple prayer.\n\nNow gunshots fill our classrooms.\nAnd precious children die.\nYou seek for answers everywhere.\nAnd ask the question WHY? ...\n\nDarrell Scott has helped create an organization called Rachel\'s Challenge, which \nworks to combat school violence and bullying.\n\n\n\nI will put honesty before the risk of humiliation.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\nTrust and honesty is an investment you put in people.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\nI admire those who trust and are trustworthy.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\nHow many of us have enough trust, strength, and faith to believe that we \ncould do the impossible?\nRachel Joy Scott\n\nHere are some of the comments written on Rachel\'s casket by her friends and \nloved ones ...\n\n\n\nRachel\'s Casket: an Outpouring of Love and Affection\n\nTomorrow is not a promise, but a chance.\nRachel Joy Scott\n\n\n\nRelated pages: Sandy Hook Poems,\nAurora Poetry, \n\nSanta Fe Poems,\nColumbine Poems,\nCourtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\nDarfur Poems,\nGaza Poems,\nHaiti Poems, \nHiroshima Poems, \nHolocaust Poems,\nNakba Poems,\n911 Poems,\nTrail of Tears\n\n\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
