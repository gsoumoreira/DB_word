Perhaps the most interesting \r\nthing about my personal canon is that many of the poems are fairly recent. This \r\nleads me to believe the death of poetry has been greatly exaggerated. I\'m including \r\nmodern English translations of ancient classics such as Wulf and Eadwacer and \r\nSweet Rose of Virtue because many readers may not have read them, and that\'s a \r\nshame. Other poems you won\'t want to miss include The Highwayman by Alfred \r\nNoyes, perhaps the most musical and the most haunting story-poem in the English \r\nlanguage, The Wild Swans at Coole by William Butler Years, and Song for the \r\nLast Act by Louise Bogan. And now, without further ado, here are \r\nmy personal choices for the best poems ever written ...\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch, editor of The HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\nSappho of Lesbos is perhaps the first great female poet known to us today, and she remains one of the very best poets of all time, regardless of gender. As you can see from the utterly stellar epigrams \r\nbelow, she remains a timeless treasure:\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 155\r\nloose translation byMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA short revealing frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 156\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nShe keeps her scents\r\nin a dressing-case.\r\nAnd her sense?\r\nIn some undiscoverable place.\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 58\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPain\r\ndrains\r\nme\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nlast\r\ndrop\r\n.\r\n\r\nLyric poetry begins with (and derives its name from) short poems that were \r\neither recited or sung to the strummings of the lyre, a harp-like instrument. The most famous of the \r\nancient Greek lyric poets is Sappho, who was born on the island of \r\nLesbos around 600 BC. The homoerotic nature \r\nof some of her poems have given the words lesbian and sapphic  \r\ndenotations and connotations of female homosexuality.\r\nBut Sappho was far from a one-trick pony. The poems above demonstrate her range.\r\n\r\nFor whatever it\'s worth, here are my top ten lyric poets of all time: William Blake, Louise Bogan, Robert \r\nBurns, Hart Crane, A. E. Housman, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Dylan \r\nThomas, Walt Whitman, William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nAmong non-English lyric poets, my top ten are: The Archpoet, Basho, Charles \r\nBaudelaire, Dante, Johan Wolfgang van Goethe, Hafiz, Federico Garc\xeda Lorca, \r\nPablo Neruda, Ranier Maria Rilke, Rumi, Sappho\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Lord \r\nByron, Geoffrey Chaucer, Sam Cooke, e. e. cummings, Emily Dickinson, John Donne, Ernest Dowson, Bob Dylan, T. S. Eliot, \r\nAllen Ginsberg, Thomas Hardy, Seamus Heaney, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Langston Hughes, John Keats, Philip Larkin, John Lennon, \r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Milton, Wilfred Owen, Sylvia Plath, \r\nEzra Pound, Christina Rossetti, William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Paul Simon, Edmund Spenser, \r\nAlfred Tennyson, Oscar Wilde, William Wordsworth, Thomas Wyatt \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was the most famous Irish poet of all time, and his \r\npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne helped \r\nmake her almost as famous as he was in Ireland. The first poem below is Yeats\' \r\nloose translation of a Pierre Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \r\nlife in her later years, tending a waning fire. The second poem, The Wild Swans \r\nat Coole is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \r\nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. She is most famous for the \r\npoem below, which appeared in her Sonnets from the Portuguese. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Sexton was a model who became a confessional \r\npoet, writing about intimate aspects of her life, after her doctor suggested \r\nthat she take up poetry as a form of therapy. She studied under Robert Lowell at \r\nBoston University, where Sylvia Plath was one of her classmates. Sexton won the \r\nPulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1967, but later committed suicide via carbon \r\nmonoxide poisoning. Topics she covered in her poems included adultery, masturbation, menstruation, abortion, despair and suicide. \r\nThe Truth the Dead Know\r\nby Anne Sexton\r\n\r\nFor my Mother, born March 1902, died March 1959\r\nand my Father, born February 1900, died June 1959\r\n\r\nGone, I say and walk from church,\r\nrefusing the stiff procession to the grave,\r\nletting the dead ride alone in the hearse.\r\nIt is June. I am tired of being brave.\r\n\r\nWe drive to the Cape. I cultivate\r\nmyself where the sun gutters from the sky,\r\nwhere the sea swings in like an iron gate\r\nand we touch. In another country people die.\r\n\r\nMy darling, the wind falls in like stones\r\nfrom the whitehearted water and when we touch\r\nwe enter touch entirely. No one\'s alone.\r\nMen kill for this, or for as much.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the dead? They lie without shoes\r\nin the stone boats. They are more like stone\r\nthan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse\r\nto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, in a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), Frye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\nHere is a printable version of\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye\'s Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep which is not \r\ncopyrighted and is thus in the public domain. \r\n\r\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is the best villanelle in the English \r\nlanguage, in my opinion, and one of the most powerful and haunting poems ever \r\nwritten in any language. \r\nIn poems like Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night, In My Craft or Sullen \r\nArt and Fern Hill, the Welsh poet ranks with any poet who  \r\nwrote in English. Several of his poems can be found on the Masters \r\npage of The HyperTexts. Dylan Thomas was fond of the unusual word \r\nspindrift and used it in a number of his poems, including the second one \r\nbelow. \r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nEdward Thomas is not as well-known as some of the other poets on this page, but \r\nAdlestrop was among the top ten most requested poems at Poetry Please, so he continues to have fans. Adlestrop is a somewhat mysterious poem, because \r\nnothing really happens and yet it seems extraordinarily sad.\r\nThomas was a literary critic, biographer and book reviewer who became a close \r\nfriend of Robert Frost when he moved to England. It was Frost who persuaded \r\nThomas to begin writing poetry around 1913-14, and Thomas was on his way to meet \r\nFrost when he wrote the poem below. Thomas was also close to the tramp or \r\nhobo poet W. H. Davies, and help bring him to the attention of the reading \r\npublic. Thomas died at the battle of Arras in 1917, so all his poems were \r\nwritten within a very narrow window of time. It is said that he decided to \r\nenlist at the age of 37 after reading a pre-publication version of Frost\'s \r\nfamous poem about indecision, The Road Not Taken. Thomas\r\ndied never having seen any of his poems in print.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdlestrop\r\nbyEdward Thomas\r\n\r\nYes. I remember Adlestrop\r\nThe name, because one afternoon\r\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\r\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\r\n\r\nThe steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\r\nNo one left and no one came\r\nOn the bare platform. What I saw\r\nWas Adlestroponly the name\r\n\r\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\r\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\r\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\r\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\r\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\r\nFarther and farther, all the birds\r\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost has often been portrayed as a pragmatic farmer-poet, which he may \r\nhave been. He certainly comes off that way in some of his poems about rural \r\nlife. But To Earthward is one of the loveliest love poems in the English \r\nlanguage and poems like Birches and After Apple Picking also reveal his \r\ndreamy, romantic side.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Earthwardby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most notorious married \r\ncouple of their era. He was a dashing romantic poet and heretic who wrote a \r\ntract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled from Oxford. He also \r\nwrote in favor of nonviolence and against monarchies, imperialism and war. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \r\nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \r\nGodwin. In 1814, at age seventeen, she \r\nbecame romantically involved with Percy Shelley, who was married at the time but \r\nthreatened to commit suicide if she spurned his advances. They spent time \r\ntogether in France and Switzerland; when they returned, Mary was pregnant. Percy\'s wife Harriet, who was also pregnant, committed suicide in 1816; Percy \r\nand Mary married soon thereafter. The same year they spent the summer with Lord \r\nByron. It was at this time that Mary conceived the story that became her famous \r\ngothic novel Frankenstein. In 1822, Percy drowned at sea at age thirty. Who knows what he would \r\nhave accomplished if he had lived longer, but he is still considered to be one \r\nof the greatest English poets. Here is one especially lovely example of his \r\nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens had an exquisite touch with meter and may have written more \r\ngreat poems than any modern English language poet. He claimed that the poet was \r\nthe priest of the invisible and seemed to see poetry replacing religion in \r\nmen\'s hearts and minds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. \r\nShe was openly bisexual and had affairs with other women and married men. When \r\nshe finally married, hers was an open marriage. Her 1920 poetry collectionA \r\nFew Figs From Thistlesdrew controversy for its novel exploration of female \r\nsexuality. She was one of the earliest and strongest voices for what became \r\nknown as feminism. One of the recurring themes of her poetry was that men might \r\nuse her body, but not possess her or have any claim over her. (And perhaps that \r\ntheir desire for her body gave her the upper hand in relationships.) \r\n\r\nI, Being Born a Woman, and Distressedby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI, being born a woman, and distressed\r\nBy all the needs and notions of my kind,\r\nAm urged by your propinquity to find\r\nYour person fair, and feel a certain zest\r\nTo bear your body\'s weight upon my breast:\r\nSo subtly is the fume of life designed,\r\nTo clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,\r\nAnd leave me once again undone, possessed. \r\n\r\nThink not for this, however, this poor treason\r\nOf my stout blood against my staggering brain,\r\nI shall remember you with love, or season\r\nMy scorn with pity  let me make it plain:\r\nI find this frenzy insufficient reason\r\nFor conversation when we meet again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not Allby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof \r\nagainst the rain,Nor yet a floating spar to men that sinkand rise and \r\nsink and rise and sink again.Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath\r\nNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;Yet many a man is making \r\nfriends with deatheven as I speak, for lack of love alone.It well may be \r\nthat in a difficult hour,pinned down by need and moaning for releaseor \r\nnagged by want past resolution\'s power,I might be driven to sell your love \r\nfor peace,Or trade the memory of this night for food.It may well be. I \r\ndo not think I would.\r\n\r\nMillay is not just another penner of sonnets. Her sonnets sparkle with life and \r\nlust amid the foreshadowing of death. She also has an interesting quality of \r\nresolve: she seems willing to give herself to men, but not to give herself away. \r\nIf she is playing games, she is playing them knowingly, and probably understands \r\nthe rules better than her partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is one of the best unknown or under-known poets of all time. Her \r\nbest poems make her a major poet, in my opinion. She\'s a poet who deserves to be \r\nread and studied. In particular, her After the Persian, Juan\'s Song \r\nand Song for the Last Act are must reads. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan\'s exquisite After the Persian can be read on our page of\r\nThe Best Long(ish) \r\nPoems of All Time. \r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was one of the better war poets, and this is his most famous \r\npoem, and justly so. He worked in a control tower during World War II, after not \r\nbeing able to pass flight training as a pilot. \r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was an English romantic poet, painter, illustrator and \r\ntranslator. He was also one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His \r\nart was characterized by sensuality and medieval revivalism. He frequently wrote \r\nsonnets to accompany his works of visual art. In 1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal \r\n(pictured above), who became his model, his passion, and eventually in 1860, his \r\nwife. But his sister Christina Rossetti may have been the better poet.\r\n\r\nSudden Light\r\nby Dante Gabriel Rossetti \r\nI have been here before,\r\n\r\nBut when or how I cannot tell:\r\nI know the grass beyond the door,\r\n\r\nThe sweet keen smell,\r\nThe sighing sound, the lights around the shore. \r\nYou have been mine before,\r\n\r\nHow long ago I may not know:\r\nBut just when at that swallow\'s soar\r\n\r\nYour neck turned so,\r\nSome veil did fall,I knew it all of yore. \r\nHas this been thus before?\r\n\r\nAnd shall not thus time\'s eddying flight\r\nStill with our lives our love restore\r\n\r\nIn death\'s despite,\r\nAnd day and night yield one delight once more?\r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is one of my favorite \r\npoems from the good auld days of English poetry.\r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \r\n\r\nConrad Aiken, in his best poems, rivals Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \r\nmasters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s Bread and Music is one of my \r\nvery favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels than for his poetry, but Piano \r\nis an immortal poem, and thus makes Lawrence an immortal poet.\r\n\r\nPiano \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvia Plath was one of the first and best of the modern confessional poets. She \r\nwon a Pulitzer Prize posthumously for her Collected Poems after\r\ncommitting suicide at the age of 31, something she seemed to have been \r\npredicting in her writing and practicing for in real life.\r\n\r\nWinter landscape, with rocks\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nWater in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,\r\nplunges headlong into that black pond\r\nwhere, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan\r\nfloats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind\r\nwhich hungers to haul the white reflection down.\r\n\r\nThe austere sun descends above the fen,\r\nan orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look\r\nlonger on this landscape of chagrin;\r\nfeathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,\r\nbrooding as the winter night comes on.\r\n\r\nLast summer\'s reeds are all engraved in ice\r\nas is your image in my eye; dry frost\r\nglazes the window of my hurt; what solace\r\ncan be struck from rock to make heart\'s waste\r\ngrow green again? Who\'d walk in this bleak place?\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt has been credited with introducing the \r\nPetrarchan sonnet into the English language. His father, Henry Wyatt, had been one of Henry \r\nVII\'s Privy Councilors, and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII came to \r\nthe throne in 1509. Thomas Wyatt followed his father to court. But it seems the \r\nyoung poet may have fallen in love with the kings mistress. Many legends and \r\nconjectures suggest that an unhappily married Wyatt had a relationship with \r\nAnne Boleyn. Their acquaintance is certain, but whether or not the two \r\nactually shared a romantic relationship remains unknown. But in his poetry, Wyatt called \r\nhis mistress Anna, and sometimes embedded pieces of information that seem to correspond with \r\nher life. For instance, this poem might well have been written \r\nabout the Kings claim on Anne Boleyn: \r\nWhoso List to Hunt\r\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nWhoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind, [Whoever longs to hunt , I know \r\nwhere there is a female deer]\r\nBut as for me, alas, I may no more.\r\nThe vain travail hath wearied me so sore,\r\nI am of them that farthest cometh behind.\r\nYet may I by no means my wearied mind\r\nDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore\r\nFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,\r\nSince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\r\nWho list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,\r\nAs well as I, may spend his time in vain.\r\nAnd graven with diamonds in letters plain\r\nThere is written, her fair neck round about:\r\nNoli me tangere, for Caesar\'s I am, [Touch me not, for I belong \r\nto the King]\r\nAnd wild for to hold, though I seem tame. \r\n\r\nNoli me tangere means Touch me not. According to the Bible, this is \r\nwhat Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she tried to embrace him after the \r\nresurrection. So perhaps after her betrothal to Henry, religious vows also \r\nentered into the picture, and left Wyatt out.\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Hart Crane\'s Voyages is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. Because of its length, Voyages appears \r\non the following page. \r\nOther poems of Crane\'s such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower \r\nalso rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde may be the most notorious bad boy in the annals of poetry and \r\nliterature. He was flamboyantly gay at a time when polite society was prim, proper and violently homophobic. As a result, he was sentenced to hard labor at \r\nReading Gaol and died soon after his release. Wilde is justly famous today for \r\nhis disdain for respectability and dull and dulling conformity, as his witty \r\nepigrams prove. But the lovely, wonderfully moving poem below proves that he was \r\nalso a true poet. \r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nTo continue reading the\r\n\r\nBest Poems Ever (listed below), please click the hyperlinked page title.\r\n\r\nTo read The Best \r\nLong(ish) Poems of All Time, including \r\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song by Anonymous, \r\nHis Confession by the Archpoet, In Memory of \r\nW.
