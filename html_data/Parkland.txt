One of the survivors of the Parkland massacre, David \r\nHogg, pointed out that when a child is riddled with bullets from a military \r\ngrade assault weapon, CPR is not going to help. We would refer Rick Santorum and \r\nthe NRA to the poem A Revolver by one of America\'s greatest poets, Carl \r\nSandburg. The poem appears on this page. \r\n\r\nIt is past time to heed Mahatma Gandhi, who said that if we are going to save the world, we \r\nmust start with the children. \r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch, an editor\r\nand publisher of Holocaust poetry\r\n\r\nAre we hearing a note of hope?\r\nAnd a little child shall lead them. Lead them where? The biblical passage in \r\nquestion is about  \r\nending violence and finding peace. America\'s adults should have protected our schoolchildren from \r\nmass shootings. We failed. Now students are taking the lead, and we \r\nMUST support them. How? With our votes. Let\'s all  \r\nvow to vote politicians who refuse to protect children out of office. Until we \r\nadults act with love to protect our children from such massacres, poets will \r\nkeep writing poems like the ones on this page, wishing with all their hearts they were not \r\nnecessary ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph for a Parkland Student\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\r\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaph for the Child Erotion\r\nby Marcus Valerius Martial \r\n\r\nLie lightly on her, turf and dew ...\r\nShe put so little weight on you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Parkland Student, with Butterflies\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhere does the butterfly go\r\nwhen lightning rails, when thunder howls,\r\nwhen hailstones scream while winter scowls\r\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\r\nWhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\r\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\r\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\r\nWhen the only relief\'s a banked fire\'s glow,\r\nwhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\r\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\r\nand hope is lost without a trace?\r\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\r\nwhere does the butterfly go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Pray Tonight, for the Parkland Survivors\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI pray tonight\r\nthe starry light\r\nmight\r\nsurround you.\r\n\r\nI pray\r\neach day\r\nthat, come what may,\r\nno dark thing confound you.\r\n\r\nI pray ere the morrow\r\nan end to your sorrow.\r\nMay angels\' white chorales\r\nsing, and astound you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParkland Call to Love\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOur hearts are broken today,\r\nfor our children\'s bodies lie broken;\r\nlet us gather them up, as we may,\r\nthat the truth of our Love may be spoken.\r\n\r\nThen, when we have put them away\r\nto nevermore dream, or be woken,\r\nlet us think of the living, and pray\r\nfor true Love, not some miserable token,\r\nto command us, for strength to obey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParkland Call to Action\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWe see their small coffins\r\nand our hearts break,\r\nso we ask the NRA\r\nDid you make a mistake?\r\n\r\nAnd we vow to save the next child\r\nfor sweet love\'s sake,\r\nbut also to protect ourselves\r\nfrom enduring such heartache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA Revolver is a newly-discovered, unpublished and previously unknown poem \nby Carl Sandburg. Although it was written decades before Columbine, Virginia \nTech, Aurora, Sandy Hook and Parkland, the poem seems highly relevant and might have been \nwritten just a few minutes ago and addressed to the religious right, the NRA \nand its powerful gun lobby. A Revolver was discovered \namong Sandburgs archives, which are housed in the Rare Book and Manuscript \nLibrary of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \nA Revolver\nby Carl Sandburg \nHere is a revolver.\nIt has an amazing language all its own.\nIt delivers unmistakable ultimatums.\nIt is the last word.\nA simple, little human forefinger can tell a terrible story with it.\nHunger, fear, revenge, robbery hide behind it.\nIt is the claw of the jungle made quick and powerful.\nIt is the club of the savage turned to magnificent precision.\nIt is more rapid than any judge or court of law.\nIt is less subtle and treacherous than any one lawyer or ten.\nWhen it has spoken, the case can not be appealed to the supreme court, nor any \r\nmandamus nor any injunction nor any stay of execution come in and interfere with the original purpose.\nAnd nothing in human philosophy persists more strangely than the \nold belief that God is always on the side of those who have the\nmost revolvers. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have this theory \r\nthat if one person can go out of their way to show \r\ncompassion, \r\nthen it will start a chain reaction of the same. \r\nPeople will never \r\nknow how far a little kindness can go.\r\nRachel Joy Scott, a victim of the Columbine massacre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is an inspirational quote by Rachel Joy Scott that has not only become a \r\npoem, but a form of visual art:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust passing by \r\nJust coming through \r\nNot staying long \r\nI always knew \r\nThis home I have \r\nWill never last \r\nRachel Joy Scott\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarrell Scott is the father of Rachel Joy Scott, the first of the thirteen victims of the \r\nColumbine High School massacre. Rachel was a beautiful 17-year-old girl, and an \r\naspiring writer and actress. Her father wrote the poetic lines below four days before \r\nspeaking to Congress on the subject of the mass killings of students and \r\nteachers, the role of the NRA, and gun control:\r\n\r\nYour laws ignore our deepest needs\r\nYour words are empty air.\r\nYou\'ve stripped away our heritage.\r\nYou\'ve outlawed simple prayer.\r\n\r\nNow gunshots fill our classrooms.\r\nAnd precious children die.\r\nYou seek for answers everywhere.\r\nAnd ask the question WHY? ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarrell Scott has helped create an organization called Rachel\'s Challenge, which \r\nworks to combat school violence and bullying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore she died, Rachel Scott drew this haunting picture with thirteen tears \r\nthat may have prophesied her fate, and the fate of the other victims. But \r\nperhaps the flower being watered by the tears symbolizes love and compassion ... \r\ndid Rachel predict that her death and those of her friends would lead to a new \r\nflowering of love and compassion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel\'s Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some of the comments written on Rachel\'s casket by her friends and \r\nloved ones ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel\'s Casket: an Outpouring of Love and Affection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarrell Scott\'s following remarks were made before the subcommittee on crime of the House \r\nJudiciary Committee at the Rayburn House office building in Washington, D.C. on \r\nMay 27, 1999. Here are excerpts from his testimony:\r\nSince the dawn of creation, there has been both good and evil in the heart of \r\nmen and of women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence.\r\nThe death of my wonderful daughter Rachel Joy Scott and the deaths of that \r\nheroic teacher and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their \r\nblood cries out for answers. The first recorded act of violence was when Cain \r\nslew his brother Abel out in the field ... My daughter\'s death will not be in \r\nvain. The young people of this country will not allow that to happen ... The \r\nyoung people of our nation hold the key. There is a spiritual awakening taking \r\nplace that will not be squelched! We do not need more religion. We do not need \r\nmore gaudy television evangelists spewing out verbal religious garbage. We do \r\nnot need more million dollar church buildings built while people with basic \r\nneeds are being ignored ...\r\n\r\nI hope and pray that Darrell Scott is correct, and that young Americans and the \r\nparents and other adults who love them will not allow the mayhem and carnage in \r\nour school halls to continue. Darrell Scott, as I understand him, has called for \r\na spiritual awakening, but I\'m afraid that mass murderers are not spiritual \r\npeople, nor are they even mildly influenced by calls for compassion and justice. \r\nSo I believe we really do need stronger gun control laws, to keep assault \r\nweapons out of their hands. Here is a poem written by his daughter ...\r\n\r\nCreate in me\r\nNothing. \r\nInvest in me \r\nNothing. \r\nI will create my own dream, \r\nmy own image, my own future. \r\nNo one else can do that for me.\r\nsigned Rachel Joy in her journal, in which she wrote immediately above the \r\npoem, in prose: I am my own responsibility. Feel no obligation, because I will \r\nbe no one\'s success story but my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpurred on in part by writings in the notebooks and diaries left behind by his \r\ndaughter, Darrell Scott  the son of an Episcopalian minister, though he himself \r\nis adamantly non-denominational  quit his job, set up a non-profit organization \r\ncalled The Columbine Redemption, and embarked on a grueling schedule of speaking \r\nengagements all across the United States to spread his message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 2nd, Rachel wrote in her journal: This is my last year Lord. I have \r\ngotten what I can. Thank you. She also drew a picture, known as Rachels Tears; \r\nit has two eyes with thirteen tears falling down. Her parents believe that \r\nRachel somehow knew that she and twelve other people were going to die within a \r\nyear. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarrell Scott said: Rachel had a unique way of tilting her head to the side \r\nwhen she was thinking seriously. And I remember her beautiful smile. Rachel had \r\nan inward motivation to accomplish as much as possible. Whenever she sensed an \r\ninjustice being done to someone, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant \r\nit was, indignation rose up within her. She was always ready to stand up for \r\nanyone who she felt was mistreated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Dana Scott, Rachel\'s big sister, she had a great sense of humor. \r\nShe once recorded a voicemail on their home phone that said, You have reached \r\nQueen Rachel and her humble servants  please leave a message after the \r\nbeep.Her middle name, Joy, was truly one of the best ways to describe her \r\nfun-loving personality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel\'s Challenge was started by Rachel\'s dad and stepmom, Darrell and Sandy \r\nScott, when they realized that the writings and drawings Rachel left not only \r\nhad an impact on her friends and classmates, but also resonated with students \r\naround the world. Although Rachel was a typical teenager who wrote about her \r\nups and downs, she had a passion and conviction that she would someday change \r\nthe world. The Scott family knew her story and passion had to be told to inspire \r\nothers to make their world a better place. More than 18 million people have been \r\ntouched by Rachel\'s message, and they continue the legacy of making a difference \r\nin their communities. Each year at least two million more people are added to \r\nthat number. In one survey, 78% of students indicated they would definitely \r\nintervene in a bullying incident in their school after seeing Rachel\'s \r\nChallenge. In a recent 24 month period, Rachel\'s Challenge received more than \r\n450 emails from students who indicated that they changed their mind about taking \r\ntheir own life after hearing Rachel\'s Challenge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel\'s Challenge is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious organization \r\nbased in Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.\r\n\r\nRelated pages: \r\n\r\nSanta Fe Poems, \r\nSandy Hook Poems, Aurora Poems,\r\nColumbine Poems,\r\nCourtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\r\nDarfur Poems,\r\nGaza Poems,\r\nHaiti Poems, \r\nHiroshima Poems, Holocaust Poems,\r\nNakba Poems,\r\n911 Poems,\r\nTrail of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
