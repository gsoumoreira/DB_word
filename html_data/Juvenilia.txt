For our purposes, we will define \r\njuvenilia as works by human beings in their early twenties, or younger. Our \r\nfocus is on poetry. What follows are the best early poems that I have come across, to \r\ndate, plus a few that I have published myself over the last 20+ years, as founder \r\nand editor of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nFamous juvenile writers include Jane Austen, Elizabeth Barrett \r\nBrowning, Anne Bronte, Charlotte Bronte, Emily Bronte, Robert Burns, George \r\nGordon (Lord Byron), Lewis Carroll, Thomas Chatterton, John Clare, Samuel Taylor \r\nColeridge, William Congreve, Abraham Cowley, William Cowper, e. e. cummings, Digby Dolben, \r\nJohn Dryden, Arthur Henry Hallam, Felicia Hemans, Leigh Hunt, John Keats, John \r\nMilton, Thomas Moore, Edgar Allan Poe, Alexander Pope, Christina Rossetti, \r\nRobert Southey, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Alfred Tennyson \r\n(Lord Tennyson) and William Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nIt bears mentioning, I believe, that many of the juvenile poets aboveindeed, \r\nmost of themmay be deemed Romantics. Furthermore, all the poets I \r\nconsider to \r\nbe the best poets of the Romantic eraWilliam Blake, Robert \r\nBurns, Lord Byron, Thomas Chatterton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Percy \r\nBysshe Shelley and William Wordsworthwrote publishable poems in their youth.\r\n\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael \r\nR. Burch\r\n\r\nJuvenilia Timeline/Ageline of Famous Poets, Writers and \r\nSongwriters\r\n\r\nMarjorie Fleming learned to read at age threepreferring adult booksand died at \r\nage eight; Robert Louis Stevenson called her the noblest work of God. \r\nShe is also known as Marjory Fleming. She was a good and highly original writer \r\nas a child, although her spelling and punctuation could be eclectic. \r\n\r\nI love the morning\'s sun to spy \r\nGlittering through the casement\'s eye.\r\n\x97Marjorie Fleming\r\n\r\nMattie Stepanek wrote his first poem at age three and published six volumes of \r\npoetry called Heartsongs before dying at age thirteen. \r\n\r\nWhen I die, I want to be a child in heaven. \r\nI want to be a 10-year-old cherub.\r\nI want to be a hero in heaven  a peacemaker, \r\njust like my goal on earth.\r\n\x97Mattie J.T. Stepanek\r\n\r\nMarshall Ball wrote his first poem, Altogether Lovely, at age five despite \r\nbeing unable to speak or move his hands; he wrote by looking at alphabet \r\nblocks that his parents assembled into words, then poems. \r\n\r\nI love seeing Grandmother. \r\nHer golden pleasant smile touches, \r\nlike the wings of a bird, \r\nthe ramparts of my mind. \r\n\x97Marshall Ball\r\n\r\nAt age six, Edward Estlin Cummings, better known as e. e. cummings, wrote a poem for his father; by age eight he was writing poetry on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD, \r\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN, \r\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR, \r\nLOVE, YOU DEAR, \r\nESTLIN. \r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett (later Browning), wrote her first poem at age six and had her \r\nfirst collection of poems published at age fourteen. Her future \r\nhusband, Robert Browning, is also on this list. She is best known for the sonnet \r\nHow Do I Love Thee (Let Me Count the Ways) from her collection Sonnets \r\nfrom the Portuguese. This excerpt is from a long poem, The Battle of \r\nMarathon, that she apparently wrote some time before her fourteenth birthday.\r\n\r\n\r\nDie! thy base shade to gloomy regions fled, \r\nJoin there, the shivering phantoms of the dead. \r\nBase slave, return to dust!\r\n\x97Elizabeth Barrett (Browning)\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley wrote Verses on a Cat at age eight. His future \r\nwife, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the author of the famous gothic science \r\nfiction novel, Frankenstein, is also on this list. Percy Shelley\'s \r\nearly poems were collected in The Esdaile Notebook, which was published \r\nin 1961 by Oxford University Press in England and by Harvard University Press in \r\nthe United States. The original notebook contained 57 poems occupying 189 pages. \r\nThe poems were apparently written from age sixteen to age twenty. This excerpt \r\nwas written as a disaffected Shelley left London for Wales:\r\n\r\nLet me forever be what I have been, \r\nBut not forever at my needy door\r\nLet Misery linger, speechless, pale and lean. \r\nI am the friend of the unfriended poor; \r\nLet me not madly stain their righteous cause in gore.\r\n\x97Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nRichard Wilbur, a future American poet laureate, published his first poem at age \r\neight, inJohn Martin\'s Magazine.\r\n\r\nA. E. Housman began writing poetry at age eight. \r\nJames Baldwin wrote his first play at age nine. \r\nAround age ten, Thomas Chatterton wrote his first published poem, On the Last \r\nEpiphany, or, Christ Coming to Judgment. The short poem Bristol was \r\nwritten when Chatterton was sixteen:\r\n\r\nThe Muses have no Credit here; and Fame \r\nConfines itself to the mercantile name.\r\nBristol may keep her prudent maxims still; \r\nI scorn her Prudence, and I ever will.\r\nSince all my vices magnify\'d are here, \r\nShe cannot paint me worse than I appear.\r\nWhen raving in the lunacy of ink,\r\nI catch the Pen and publish what I think.\r\n\x97Thomas Chatterton\r\n\r\n At age ten, Alfred Tennyson was writing hundreds and \r\nhundreds of lines in regular Popeian metre.\r\n\r\nHeavily hangs the broad sunflower\r\nOver its grave i\' the earth so chilly;\r\nHeavily hangs the hollyhock,\r\nHeavily hangs the tiger-lily.\r\n\x97Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nHelen Keller, despite being blind, deaf and unable to speak until age six, wrote a \r\nshort story, The Frost King, that was published by age eleven. \r\nStevie Wonder wrote his first song, Lonely Boy, at age eleven. \r\nOscar Wilde may have begun writing Requiescat, his wonderful elegy to his \r\nsister Isola, around age twelve; he published a number of poems in his teens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\n \x97Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, I read the Bible from cover to cover around age ten or \r\neleven. Sometime after reading the Bible, I came up with the following epigram:\r\n\r\nIf God\r\nis good,\r\nhalf the Bible\r\nis libel. \r\n\r\n \x97Michael \r\nR. Burch\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope wrote his famous poem Ode to Solitude at age twelve.\r\n Christina Rossetti began to record the dates of her poems \r\nat age twelve.\r\nRobert Browning\'s parents attempted to publish a book of his poems, \r\nIncondita, when he was age twelve. He would later destroy the manuscript. \r\n\r\nPaul Simon wrote his first song, The Girl for Me, at age twelve. \r\nAnne Frank started her famous diary at age thirteen.\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge started writing his monody to Thomas Chatterton at age \r\nthirteen.\r\n Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published his first poem in the\r\nPortlandGazette at age thirteen, The Battle of Lovell\'s Pond.\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant had a satirical poem The Embargo published at age \r\nthirteen.\r\n Lord Byron had poems written at age fourteen published in \r\nFugitive Pieces, but the book was recalled and burned because some of the \r\npoems were too hot!\r\nEdgar Allan Poe is writing poems to woo girls at age fourteen; he writes To \r\nHelen around age fifteen after being inspired by the slender, graceful figure \r\nof a friend\'s mother! \r\nStephen Crane wrote the short story Uncle Jake and the Bell Handle at age \r\nfourteen.\r\nArthur Rimbaud was published at age fifteen; he retired \r\nfrom writing at age nineteen to become a soldier and smuggler!\r\nRobert Burns, generally considered to be the greatest of the Scottish bards, \r\nwrote a love poem at age fifteen. \r\nAccording to Thomas Seccombe, William Blake\'s How Sweet I Roamed was written \r\naround age fifteen.\r\nW. H. Auden began writing poems at age fifteen. \r\nPhilip Larkin began writing poems around the same age, and Auden was one of his \r\nearly influences!\r\nTaylor Swift wrote her song Love Story at age sixteen. \r\nLorde wrote her song Royals with its different kind of buzz at age sixteen.\r\n\r\nGeorge Michael wrote the song Careless Whisper at age seventeen. \r\nS. E. Hinton wrote her first book at age fifteen and published her best-selling \r\nnovel The Outsiders at age eighteen.\r\nAlfred Tennyson and his two elder brothers had a book of poems published when he \r\nwas seventeen. \r\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley, began work on her famous \r\ngothic horror novel Frankenstein at age eighteen, while they were \r\nvisiting Lord Byron. All three are on this list. \r\nAlicia Keys wrote her stunning debut single and smash hit Fallin\' at age \r\ntwenty. \r\n\r\nNOTE: In the list above the term first poem means the first poem that we are \r\naware of, which is not necessarily the first poem written. The first poem of \r\nmine that I have in my possession dates to when I was fourteen years old. But I \r\nremember writing a small number of poems at much younger ages: some as school \r\nassignments, others as larks. However, I didn\'t keep the poems and can\'t \r\nremember anything about them, except that one may have been about ants, a hill, \r\nor an anthill. So for all practical purposes, my career as a poet begins with \r\nthe first serious poems that I can produce. And I was \r\ndead serious about becoming a poet by age fifteen. (Whether I succeeded may \r\nstill be open to debate, but I\'m working on it!)Michael R. Burch \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASong\r\nby Digby Mackworth Dolben\r\n\r\nDigby Dolben (1848-1867) died at age nineteen, so all his poems were written in \r\nhis teens. While he has been largely if not completely forgotten, a book of his \r\npoems was edited and published by Robert Bridges, an English poet laureate, so \r\nhis poetry fortunately survives. In my opinion, Digby Dolben is a poet who \r\ndeserves to be read. The poem below is one shining example.\r\n\r\nThe world is young today:\r\nForget the gods are old,\r\nForget the years of gold\r\nWhen all the months were May.\r\n\r\nA little flower of Love\r\nIs ours, without a root,\r\nWithout the end of fruit,\r\nYet \x96 take the scent thereof.\r\n\r\nThere may be hope above,\r\nThere may be rest beneath;\r\nWe see them not, but Death\r\nIs palpable \x96 and Love.\r\n\r\nFor a brief bio of Digby Dolben by Simon Edge, please click here:\r\nDigby Dolben Bio. \r\nTo read more of his work please click\r\nThe Best Poems of Digby Mackworth Dolben.\r\n\r\nSong from \xc6lla: Under the Willow Tree, or, Minstrel\'s Song\r\nby Thomas Chatterton, age 17 or younger\r\nmodernization/translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nO!singunto my roundelay,\r\nO! drop the briny tear with me,\r\nDance no more at holy-day,\r\nLike a running river be: \r\n\r\nMy love is dead,\r\nGone to his death-bed \r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nBlack his crown as the winter night,\r\nWhite his flesh as the summer snow\r\nRed his face as the morning light,\r\nCold he lies in the grave below:\r\n\r\n My love is dead,\r\nGone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nSweet his tongue as the throstle\'s note,\r\nQuick in dance as thought can be,  \r\nDeft his tabor, cudgel stout;\r\nO! he lies by the willow-tree!\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nHark! the raven flaps his wing\r\nIn the briar\'d dell below; \r\nHark! the death-owl loud doth sing \r\nTo the nightmares, as they go:\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nSee! the white moon shines on high; \r\nWhiter is my true-love\'s shroud:\r\nWhiter than the morning sky, \r\nWhiter than the evening cloud:\r\n\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nHere upon my true-love\'s grave \r\nShall the barren flowers be laid; \r\nNot one holy saint to save\r\nAll the coldness of a maid:\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nWith my hands I\'ll frame the briars\r\nRound his holy corpse to grow:\r\nElf and fairy, light your fires,\r\nHere my body, stilled, shall go: \r\n\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree.\r\n\r\nCome, with acorn-cup and thorn,\r\nDrain my heart\xe8s blood away; \r\nLife and all its good I scorn, \r\nDance by night, or feast by day:\r\n\r\nMy love is dead,\r\n Gone to his death-bed \r\n\r\nAll under the willow-tree. \r\n\r\nWater witches, crowned with plaits,\r\nBear me to your lethal tide. \r\nI die; I come; my true love waits. \r\nThus the damsel spoke, and died. \r\n\r\nThe song above is, in my opinion, competitive with Shakespeare\'s \r\nsongs in his plays, and may be the best of Thomas Chatterton\'s so-called Rowley poems. It seems \r\nrather obvious that this song was written in modern English, then backdated. \r\nOne wonders whether Chatterton wrote it in response to Shakespeare\'s Under the \r\nGreenwood Tree. The greenwood tree or evergreen is a symbol of immortality. The \r\nweeping willow is a symbol of sorrow, and the greatest human sorrow is that of \r\nmortality and the separations caused by death. If Chatterton wrote his song as a \r\nrefutation of Shakespeare\'s, I think he did a damn good job. But it\'s a splendid \r\nsong in its own right. \r\nSong\r\nby Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nThis poem was first printed in 1830, when Alfred Tennyson (1809-1892) was around \r\ntwenty years old. From what I have been able to gather, the poem \r\nwas written in the garden at the Old Rectory, Somersby, where his father was the \r\nrector. Tennyson and his two elder brothers had a book of poems published when \r\nAlfred was seventeen. This poem seems to have \r\nhaunted Edgar Allan Poe, a fervent admirer of Tennyson\'s early poems.\r\n\r\n1.\r\nA Spirit haunts the year\'s last hours\r\nDwelling amid these yellowing bowers:\r\nTo himself he talks;\r\nFor at eventide, listening earnestly,\r\nAt his work you may hear him sob and sigh\r\nIn the walks;\r\nEarthward he boweth the heavy stalks\r\nOf the mouldering flowers:\r\nHeavily hangs the broad sunflower\r\nOver its grave i\' the earth so chilly;\r\nHeavily hangs the hollyhock,\r\nHeavily hangs the tiger-lily.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe air is damp, and hush\'d, and close,\r\nAs a sick man\'s room when he taketh repose\r\nAn hour before death;\r\nMy very heart faints and my whole soul grieves\r\nAt the moist rich smell of the rotting leaves,\r\nAnd the breath\r\nOf the fading edges of box beneath,\r\nAnd the year\'s last rose.\r\nHeavily hangs the broad sunflower\r\nOver its grave i\' the earth so chilly;\r\nHeavily hangs the hollyhock,\r\nHeavily hangs the tiger-lily.\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde\r\n\r\nOscar Fingal O\x92Flahertie Wills Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. In 1867, Oscar \r\nWilde\'s sister Isola died at age nine; he was twelve at the time. His elegy for \r\nIsola, Requiescat, is surely one of the loveliest and most touching poems in \r\nthe English language. According to poeticus.com, Wilde wrote the poem in his \r\nteens. If so it is certainly a contender for the mantle of the best poem by a \r\nteenage poet! Wilde attached the word Avignon to the poem; according to \r\nVictorian Literature: An Anthology, Wilde is believed to have visited \r\nAvignon in 1875 and to have finished the poem there. In any case, at age \r\nseventeen he was awarded a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity \r\nCollege, Dublin, where he shared rooms with his older brother Willie Wilde (who \r\nalso became a published poet). At Trinity, Oscar Wilde worked with his tutor, J. \r\nP. Mahaffy, on the latter\'s book Social Life in Greece. Mahaffy at one \r\ntime boasted of having created Wilde; later, he named him the only blot on my \r\ntutorship. Wilde became an established member of the University Philosophical \r\nSociety: the members\' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter \r\n(sportingly) mocking Wilde\'s emergent aestheticism. Around that time Wilde \r\npresented a paper titled Aesthetic Morality, which may be his first datable \r\nprose work. His first datable poem may be Arona which bears the timestamp July \r\n10, 1875. A Chorus of Cloud Maidens, Wilde\x92s earliest published poem, appeared \r\nin theDublin University Magazinein November 1875, and was signed \r\nOscar O\x92F. Wills Wilde. By 1876, Wilde had been published in literary magazines \r\nsuch as The Irish Monthly, Month, Charmides andKottabos. (In \r\nthe Month, Wilde was identified only by his unusual initials: OFO\x92FWW. \r\nAnd ironically, while accepting the hedonistic Wilde, who lived up to his last \r\nname, the Jesuit magazine turned down one of its own, Father Gerard Manley \r\nHopkins!) At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he \r\ncame first in his class in his first year, won a scholarship by competitive \r\nexamination in his second, and then, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal, \r\nthe University\'s highest academic award in Greek. He was encouraged to compete \r\nfor a demyship (scolarship) to Magdalen College, Oxford, which he won easily, having already \r\nstudied Greek for over nine years. In 1878, the year of his graduation, his poem \r\nRavenna won the Newdigate Prize for the best English verse composition by an \r\nOxford undergraduate. So either by his teens, or no later than his early \r\ntwenties, Wilde was an accomplished poet and he would go on to become an \r\nimportant playwright, novelist and epigrammatist. \r\n\r\nThere\x92s also a description of Oscar in adulthood, recalling his sister Isola \r\n\x93dancing like a golden sunbeam about the house.\x94 In Wilde\x92s poem Requiescat his love for her is palpable:\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nBelow, the original poem appears on the left. My \r\ntranslation/modernization on the right can be used as a reference or study \r\nguide. If you prefer not to wrestle with the medieval spellings, you can start \r\nwith the translation and refer back to the original poem as you prefer. Please \r\nkeep in mind that translating or modernizing such a poem is far from a perfect \r\nscience. Concessions must be made to meter, if the poem is to remain rhythmic; this means sometimes adding a word here and deleting a word there, \r\nhopefully without altering the poet\'s intended meaning. Chatterton is  \r\ndifficult to interpret, in spots, because it seems likely that he coined words \r\nto suit his meter and purpose. While there is nothing wrong with that \r\n(Shakespeare did the same), it is not always completely obvious what Chatterton \r\nmeant. I have tried to remain faithful to what I interpret as his larger \r\nmeaning.  Michael R.

and poor;Helpless and old am I, alas!, and poor;\r\nNo house, ne friend, ne moneie in my pouche;No house, no \r\nfriend, no money in my purse;\r\nAll yatte I call my owne is this my silver crouche.\x94All that I call my own is thismy silver cross.\r\n\r\n\x93Varlet,\x94 replyd the Abbatte, \x93cease your dinne;Varlet, replied \r\nthe Abbott, cease your din;\r\nThis is no season almes and prayers to give;This is no \r\nseason alms and prayers to give;\r\nMie porter never lets a faitour in;My porter never lets a beggar in;\r\nNone touch mie rynge who not in honour live.\x94None touch my \r\nring who in dishonor live.\r\nAnd now the sonne with the blacke cloudes did stryve,And now the sun with \r\nthe blackened clouds did strive,\r\nAnd shettynge on the grounde his glairie raie,And \r\nshed upon the ground his glaring ray; \r\nThe Abbatte spurrde his steede, and eftsoones roaddeThe \r\nAbbot spurred his steed, and swiftly rode away.\r\nawaie.\r\n\r\nOnce moe the skie was blacke, the thunder rolde;Once more the sky \r\ngrew black; the thunder rolled;\r\nFaste reyneynge oer the plaine a prieste was seen;Fast running \r\no\'er the plain a priest was seen;\r\nNe dighte full proude, ne buttoned up in golde;Not full of \r\npride, not buttoned up in gold;\r\nHis cope and jape were graie, and eke were clene;His cape and jape \r\nwere gray, and also clean;\r\nA Limitoure he was of order seene; \r\nA Limitour he was, his order serene;\r\nAnd from the pathwaie side then turned hee,And from the pathway side he turned to see\r\nWhere the pore almer laie binethe the holmen tree.Where the poor almer \r\nlay beneath the holly tree. \r\n\r\n\x93An almes, sir priest!\x94 the droppynge pilgrim sayde,An alms, Sir Priest! the drooping pilgrim said,\r\n\x93For sweete Seyncte Marie and your order sake.\x94For sweet Saint Mary and your order\'s sake.\r\nThe Limitoure then loosen\x92d his pouche threade,The Limitour then loosen\'d his purse\'s thread,\r\nAnd did thereoute a groate of silver take;And from it did a groat of silver take;\r\nThe mister pilgrim dyd for halline shake.The \r\nneedy pilgrim did for happiness shake.\r\n\x93Here take this silver, it maie eathe thie care;Here, take this silver, it may ease thy care;\r\nWe are Goddes stewards all, nete of oure owne we  We are God\'s \r\nstewards all, naught of our own we bear.\r\nbare.\r\n\r\n\x93But ah! unhailie pilgrim, lerne of me,But ah! unhappy pilgrim, learn of me,\r\nScathe anie give a rentrolle to their Lorde.Scarce any give a rentroll to their Lord.\r\nHere take my semecope, thou arte bare I see;Here, take my cloak, as thou are bare, I see;\r\nTis thyne; the Seynctes will give me mie rewarde.\x94\'Tis thine; the Saints will give me my reward.\r\nHe left the pilgrim, and his waie aborde.He left \r\nthe pilgrim, went his way abroad.\r\nVirgynne and hallie Seyncte, who sitte yn gloure,Virgin and happy Saints, in glory showered,\r\nOr give the mittee will, or give the gode man power.Let the mighty bend, or the good man be empowered!\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR\'S NOTE: It is possible that some words used by Chatterton were his \r\nown coinages; some of them apparently cannot be found in medieval literature. In \r\na few places I have used similar-sounding words that seem to not overly disturb \r\nthe meaning of the poem. Michael R.
