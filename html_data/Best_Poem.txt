Burch\r\n\r\nCounting down to the greatest poem of all time was a sometimes-eclectic \r\nendeavor, since many readers have probably never heard of my \r\nchoice for number one and several other high finishers. But of course my list is subjective, \r\na matter of individual taste and fancy. Perhaps the most interesting thing about my personal \r\ncanon is that many of the poems were written fairly recently. This leads me to \r\nbelieve the death of poetry has been greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nPoem #50: \r\nThe Garden\r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\nThis poem by\r\nEzra Pound is a wonderful \r\nminiature of English society, captured in a poem for the ages. It is also one of \r\nthe best early free verse poems written in the English language. \r\n\r\nPoem #49: Distant light\r\n\r\nby Walid Khazindar\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBitterly cold,\r\nwinter clings to the naked trees.\r\n\r\nIf only you would free \r\nthe bright sparrows\r\nfrom your fingertipss\r\nand unleash a smilethat shy, tentative smile\r\nfrom the imprisoned anguish I see.\r\n\r\nSing! Can we not sing\r\nas if we were warm, hand-in-hand,\r\nsheltered by shade from a sweltering sun?\r\n\r\nCan you not always remain this way,\r\nstoking the fire, more beautiful than expected, in reverie?\r\n\r\nDarkness increases and we must remain vigilant\r\nnow that this distant light is our sole consolation\r\nthis imperiled flame, which from the beginning\r\nhas been flickering,\r\nin danger of going out.\r\n\r\nCome to me, closer and closer.\r\nI dont want to be able to tell my hand from yours.\r\nAnd lets stay awake, lest the snow smother us.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully moving poem by Walid Khazindar, who was born in 1950 in Gaza City. He is considered \r\nto be one of the very best Palestinian poets; his poetry \r\nhas been said to be characterized by metaphoric originality and a novel thematic approach \r\nunprecedented in Arabic poetry. He was awarded the first Palestine Prize for \r\nPoetry in 1997.\r\n\r\nPoem #48: The Layers\r\nby Stanley Kunitz\r\n\r\nI have walked through many lives,\r\nsome of them my own,\r\nand I am not who I was,\r\nthough some principle of being\r\nabides, from which I struggle\r\nnot to stray.\r\nWhen I look behind,\r\nas I am compelled to look\r\nbefore I can gather strength\r\nto proceed on my journey,\r\nI see the milestones dwindling\r\ntoward the horizon\r\nand the slow fires trailing\r\nfrom the abandoned camp-sites,\r\nover which scavenger angels\r\nwheel on heavy wings.\r\nOh, I have made myself a tribe\r\nout of my true affections,\r\nand my tribe is scattered!\r\nHow shall the heart be reconciled\r\nto its feast of losses? ...\r\n\r\nThe Layers is one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. \r\n Stanley Kunitz (1905-2006) was an American poet who was \r\nappointed Poet Laureate twice, first in 1974 and then again in 2000, at age 95! Now there\'s a poet with real staying power!\r\n\r\nPoem #47: \r\n\r\nMy Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\r\n A rainbow in the sky:\r\nSo was it when my life began;\r\nSo is it now I am a man;\r\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\r\n Or let me die!\r\nThe Child is father of the Man;\r\nI could wish my days to be\r\nBound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wordsworth was one of the Big Six (the great Romantic poets who ushered \r\nin what we now call Modernism). Along with William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, \r\nJohn Keats, George Gordon (Lord Bryon) and his close friend and partner in \r\npoetic crime, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Wordsworth helped create a new type of \r\npoetry that was simultaneously more spiritual and more heretical than most of \r\nthe classical poetry that preceded it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #46: \r\nWulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous Old English/Anglo-Saxon poem, circa 960-990 AD)\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy people pursue him like crippled prey.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; we\'re on another.\r\nHis island\'s a fortress, fastened by fens.\r\nThere are fierce curs on this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds.\r\nWhenever it rained and I wept, disconsolate,\r\nthe boldest cur came and caught me in his paws.\r\nGood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat!\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? Watchdog!\r\nA wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer has been one of my favorite poems since the first time I \r\nread it. In fact, I liked the poem so much that I ended up translating it myself! \r\nThis is one of the oldest poems in the English language, and in all likelihood \r\nthe first extant poem by a female poet. It is also one of the first English \r\npoems to employ a refrain, and its closing metaphor of a loveless relationship \r\nbeing like a song in which two voices never harmonized remains one of the \r\nstrongest in English literature.\r\n\r\nPoem #45 (tie): \r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nHerrick is pleasing to the ear, and should continue to be read always, or at \r\nleast as long as the English language endures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #45 (tie): \r\nGo, Lovely Roseby Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nThis a near-perfect poem that still reads wonderfully well today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #44: \r\nFull Fathom Five\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nI think Shakespeare\'s songs are superior to his sonnets, but why quibble? The fact \r\nthat Shakespeare ranks no higher than number 44 only indicates how competitive \r\nthis list is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #43: \r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti wrote a handful of immortal poems, and that makes her an \r\nimmortal poet. \r\nTwo of her poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nPoem #42: \r\n\r\nThe Listeners\r\nby Walter De La Mare\r\n\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\r\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\r\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\r\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\r\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\r\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\r\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\r\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem that should make its author, Walter \r\nDe La Mare, \r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nPoem #41: \r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar\'s wonderful Sweet Rose of Virtue is one of my favorite \r\npoems from the early days of English poetry. I chose to translate it myself, to make \r\nit more accessible to modern readers.\r\n\r\nPoem #40: The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls\r\n\r\nby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide rises, the tide falls,\r\nThe twilight darkens, the curlew calls;\r\nAlong the sea-sands damp and brown\r\nThe traveller hastens toward the town,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nDarkness settles on roofs and walls,\r\nBut the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;\r\nThe little waves, with their soft, white hands,\r\nEfface the footprints in the sands,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nThe morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls\r\nStamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;\r\nThe day returns, but nevermore\r\nReturns the traveller to the shore,\r\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow rivaled his English counterpart Alfred Tennyson in \r\nglobal popularity, and rightly so.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #39: To Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson wrote another immortal poem, his eulogy to his son, but I\'m going to \r\ngo with this perfectly-rendered love song ...\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #38:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn The Dark Season\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI fall out of the foliage of my feelings.\r\nThat is the beginning, the ending,\r\nwhen the orange peels appear\r\nfrom the shrinking lips of the snow\r\nand broken bottles, still clinging to their labels,\r\nin the gutter outside the church.\r\nA silk stocking coils in the mud.\r\nIn the dark season, someone has sown\r\nthe seed of confusion. The church will graze\r\non the flowers, the fruits of love,\r\nthe soft nutritious pulp of remorse.\r\nDo these events signify\r\nsummertime in another hemisphere?\r\nOne studied a new language in the darkness,\r\nlooked far down into the well,\r\ninto the hints of sunlight in its depths.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe are dead such a long time before\r\nand will be dead such a long time after\r\nthis leaping into light\r\nas a dolphin leaps from the sea\r\nand carries the glare of that moment\r\nback among the curious creatures\r\nwho have not known the light.\r\nDon\'t tell me this is like Plato\'s cave;\r\nI know that. But in death, our element,\r\nwho swims with us? Do we even?\r\nIf God is light...No, but there may be,\r\nas the poet says, a soft monster\r\ndeeply sleeping among his thousand\r\narms under millennia\r\nunnumbered, and enormous polypi.\r\nI think we have been frightened into life\r\nas fish leap from greater fish below.\r\nWe cry angrily in our cradles,\r\nthen overcome, grow tranquil through the years,\r\nhopefully, ready ever for the depths\r\never ready for us.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nYes, but of course, there is the need\r\nfor symmetry. Matter calls out\r\nfor antimatter, which forthwith\r\nsings in the shadows. Thus, tonight\r\nstreetlight fingers new foliage\r\nwith breezes making light of it,\r\nwhere unseen trunk divides itself\r\ninto a multitude of tips\r\nabove ground and below, as in\r\na mirror, strangers to each other,\r\ntwo lives, depending on each other,\r\ntherefore the same life: in dark depth\r\nand moisture one, in dry sunlight\r\nthe other: God and Satan, one,\r\nfemale and male in each one, one.\r\nDolphins from darkness visit light.\r\nWho from her glitter visits us?\r\nThese, lost inside you: look outside\r\nin the not-you: you find them there.\r\n\r\nRichard Moore is one of my favorite contemporary poets. He specialized \r\nin writing formal poetry, and was a strong proponent of perfect rhyme. But he \r\nstill managed to write one of my favorite free verse poems, In the Dark \r\nSeason. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #37: The Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nTom Moore was an Irish tenor, songwriter and poet; this wonderfully haunting poem \r\ndemonstrates his virtuosity as a poet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #36:\r\nSong\r\nby John Donne\r\n\r\nGo and catch a falling star,\r\nGet with child a mandrake root,\r\nTell me where all past years are,\r\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\r\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\r\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\r\nAnd find\r\nWhat wind\r\nServes to advance an honest mind.\r\n\r\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\r\nThings invisible to see,\r\nRide ten thousand days and nights\r\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\r\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\r\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\r\nAnd swear\r\nNo where\r\nLives a woman true and fair.\r\n\r\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\r\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\r\nYet do not; I would not go,\r\nThough at next door we might meet.\r\nThough she were true when you met her,\r\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\r\nYet she\r\nWill be\r\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\r\n\r\nJohn Donne wrote some of the sexiest poems in the English language, and some of \r\nthe best devotional poems as well. Talk about range!\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #35: \r\nLuke Havergal\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\r\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\r\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\r\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\r\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\r\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\r\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\r\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\r\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\r\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\r\nIn eastern skies.\r\n\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\r\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\r\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\r\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\r\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\r\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\r\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\r\nTo tell you this.\r\n\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\r\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\r\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\r\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\r\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\r\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\r\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\r\nLuke Havergal.\r\n\r\nLuke Havergal by E. A. Robinson is one of the eeriest, most haunting poems in \r\nthe English language. Robinson wrote a number of other very strong poems and \r\nremains one of America\'s best early modern poets. Several of \r\nhis poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #34:\r\n\r\nNaming of Parts\r\nby Henry Reed\r\n\r\nVixi duellis nuper idoneus\r\nEt militavi non sine glori\r\n\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Yesterday,\r\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\r\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\r\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\r\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\r\n And today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\r\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\r\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling swivel,\r\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\r\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\r\n Which in our case we have not got.\r\n\r\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\r\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let me\r\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\r\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\r\n Any of them using their finger.\r\n\r\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\r\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\r\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\r\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\r\n They call it easing the Spring.\r\n\r\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\r\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\r\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of balance,\r\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the almond-blossom\r\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards,\r\n For today we have naming of parts.\r\n\r\nHenry Reed is likely to be remembered by this one poem, but fortunately for him \r\n(and for us) it should make him immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #33: \r\nBagpipe Music\r\nby Louis MacNeice\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\r\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the peepshow.\r\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes are made of python,\r\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls with head of bison.\r\n\r\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\r\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\r\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\r\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\r\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a taxi.\r\n\r\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the heather,\r\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\r\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\r\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the puncture.\r\n\r\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was sober,\r\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one foot over.\r\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with repulsion,\r\nSaid to the midwife Take it away; I\'m through with overproduction.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the gossip column, it\'s no go the Ceilidh,\r\nAll we want is a mother\'s help and a sugar-stick for the baby.\r\n\r\nWillie Murray cut his thumb, couldn\'t count the damage,\r\nTook the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a bandage.\r\nHis brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,\r\nThrew the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the parish.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the Herring Board, it\'s no go the Bible,\r\nAll we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go the picture palace, it\'s no go the stadium,\r\nIt\'s no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,\r\nIt\'s no go the Government grants, it\'s no go the elections,\r\nSit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a pension.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no go my honey love, it\'s no go my poppet;\r\nWork your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the profit.\r\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall forever,\r\nBut if you break the bloody glass you won\'t hold up the weather.\r\n\r\nLouis MacNeice is an undervalued poet, and Bagpipe Music is a tour-de-force.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #32: \r\n\r\nOzymandias\r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley was one of the great Romantics. His touch with meter and rhyme was exquisite.\r\n    \r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #31: \r\n\r\nOne Art\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch. And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied. It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #30: \r\nThe Windhover\r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\nI caught this morning morning\'s minion, king-\r\n dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\r\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\r\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\r\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\r\n As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\r\n Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding\r\nStirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!\r\n\r\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\r\n Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\r\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!\r\n\r\n No wonder of it: sh\xe9er pl\xf3d makes plough down sillion\r\nShine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,\r\n Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.\r\n\r\nG. M. Hopkins did things with the language no poet before or since has done, or \r\nat least not as well and to the same extent. His influence can be seen in the \r\nwork of Dylan Thomas, but no one has ever duplicated his sprung rhythms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #29: \r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\nThomas Hardy wrote a number of truly great poems, including The Darkling \r\nThrush, The Convergence of the Twain and Channel Firing.\r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #28: \r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby\r\nT. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift is one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. \r\nI find it wonderfully touching and moving, and always a pleasure to read.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nPoem #27: \r\n\r\nThe Unreturning\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nSuddenly night crushed out the day and hurled\r\nHer remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.\r\nThen fell a stillness such as harks appalled\r\nWhen far-gone dead return upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\nWilfred Owen is a war poet without peer, and one of the first great modern \r\npoets. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est is probably the best anti-war poem in the \r\nEnglish language, perhaps in any language. If man ever grows wise enough as a \r\nspecies to abolish war, Wilfred Owen\'s voice, echoed in thousands of other poems \r\nand songs, will have been a major catalyst.\r\n\r\nPoem #26: Excerpts from More Poems, XXXVI\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nHere dead lie we because we did not choose\r\nTo live and shame the land from which we sprung.\r\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\r\nBut young men think it is, and we were young.\r\n\r\nI have loved the four lines above by Housman, since I first read them. He could \r\nwrite movingly without indulging in images, melodrama or sophistry, and rivals \r\nShakespeare in what he accomplished with direct statement. Housman is \r\ncertainly a major poet, and one of our very best critics of society and \r\nreligion, along with Blake, Twain and Wilde. A good number of his poems can be \r\nfound on the Masters  \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nPoem #25 (tie): The Armadillo\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\nfor Robert Lowell\r\n\r\nThis is the time of year\r\nwhen almost every night\r\nthe frail, illegal fire balloons appear.\r\nClimbing the mountain height,\r\n\r\nrising toward a saint\r\nstill honored in these parts,\r\nthe paper chambers flush and fill with light\r\nthat comes and goes, like hearts.\r\n\r\nOnce up against the sky it\'s hard\r\nto tell them from the stars \r\nplanets, that is  the tinted ones:\r\nVenus going down, or Mars,\r\n\r\nor the pale green one. With a wind,\r\nthey flare and falter, wobble and toss;\r\nbut if it\'s still they steer between\r\nthe kite sticks of the Southern Cross,\r\n\r\nreceding, dwindling, solemnly\r\nand steadily forsaking us,\r\nor, in the downdraft from a peak,\r\nsuddenly turning dangerous.\r\n\r\nLast night another big one fell.\r\nIt splattered like an egg of fire\r\nagainst the cliff behind the house.\r\nThe flame ran down. We saw the pair\r\n\r\nof owls who nest there flying up\r\nand up, their whirling black-and-white\r\nstained bright pink underneath, until\r\nthey shrieked up out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe ancient owls\' nest must have burned.\r\nHastily, all alone,\r\na glistening armadillo left the scene,\r\nrose-flecked, head down, tail down,\r\n\r\nand then a baby rabbit jumped out,\r\nshort-eared, to our surprise.\r\nSo soft!  a handful of intangible ash\r\nwith fixed, ignited eyes.\r\n\r\nToo pretty, dreamlike mimicry!\r\nO falling fire and piercing cry\r\nand panic, and a weak mailed fist\r\nclenched ignorant against the sky!\r\n\r\n\t\r\nElizabeth Bishop wrote a small handful of truly great poems such as One Art, \r\nThe Fish and The Armadillo, and can surely be considered a major poet as a \r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPoem #25 (tie): Skunk Hour\r\nby Robert Lowell\r\nfor Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\nNautilus Island\'s hermit\r\nheiress still lives through winter in her Spartan cottage;\r\nher sheep still graze above the sea.\r\nHer son\'s a bishop. Her farmer\r\nis first selectman in our village;\r\nshe\'s in her dotage.\r\n\r\nThirsting for\r\nthe hierarchic privacy\r\nof Queen Victoria\'s century,\r\nshe buys up all\r\nthe eyesores facing her shore,\r\nand lets them fall.\r\n\r\nThe season\'s ill\r\nwe\'ve lost our summer millionaire,\r\nwho seemed to leap from an L. L. Bean\r\ncatalogue. His nine-knot yawl\r\nwas auctioned off to lobstermen.\r\nA red fox stain covers Blue Hill.\r\n\r\nAnd now our fairy\r\ndecorator brightens his shop for fall;\r\nhis fishnet\'s filled with orange cork,\r\norange, his cobbler\'s bench and awl;\r\nthere is no money in his work,\r\nhe\'d rather marry.\r\n\r\nOne dark night,\r\nmy Tudor Ford climbed the hill\'s skull;\r\nI watched for love-cars. Lights turned down,\r\nthey lay together, hull to hull,\r\nwhere the graveyard shelves on the town. . . .\r\nMy mind\'s not right.\r\n\r\nA car radio bleats,\r\nLove, O careless Love. . . . I hear\r\nmy ill-spirit sob in each blood cell,\r\nas if my hand were at its throat. . . .\r\nI myself am hell;\r\nnobody\'s here\r\n\r\nonly skunks, that search\r\nin the moonlight for a bite to eat.\r\nThey march on their soles up Main Street:\r\nwhite stripes, moonstruck eyes\' red fire\r\nunder the chalk-dry and spar spire\r\nof the Trinitarian Church.\r\n\r\nI stand on top\r\nof our back steps and breathe the rich air\r\na mother skunk with her column of kittens swills the garbage pail.\r\nShe jabs her wedge-head in a cup\r\nof sour cream, drops her ostrich tail,\r\nand will not scare.\r\n\r\nRobert Lowell\'s poetic response to Bishop\'s poem is very close to hers in \r\nqualitya very fecund coupling.\r\n\r\nPoem #24: The Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep \r\nmonotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard \r\ndaylight steer.\r\n\r\nI can\'t remember where I first read The Death of a Toad by Richard Wilbur, but \r\nit haunted me until I finally rediscovered it many years later, flipping through \r\nthe pages of a poetry anthology in a bookstore. I had forgotten the poem\'s title \r\nand its poet\'s name, but I had never been able to forget its words\' magic.\r\n\r\nPoem #23: La Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair  \r\nlean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\nAlong with Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot helped create modern free verse. This poem \r\ndemonstrates his remarkable talent. While Eliot was a sophisticated, urbane \r\npoet, his main theme was human love and he often comes across as a somewhat \r\nnerdy, disillusioned romantic. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nPoem #22: \r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nwith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\nThomas Wyatt lived during the \r\nreign of King Henry VIII. Wyatt\'s Whoso List to Hunt may have been written to \r\nAnne Boleyn, the mistress of Henry who became his queen, only to be beheaded.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nPoem #21: \r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\nIn poems like Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night, In My Craft or Sullen \r\nArt and Fern Hill the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas ranks with any poet who ever \r\nwrote in English. \r\n    \r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #20:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCradle Songby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n \r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n \r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n \r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\nCradle Song by William Blake is one of the most touching, moving poems in \r\nthe English language. It is probably the best lullaby in the English language, \r\nalong with Lullaby by W. H. Auden. Blake wrote a number of truly great poems, \r\nseveral of which can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n \r\nPoem #19:\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstasy.\r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\nAuden\'s Lullaby is one of the truly great poems in the English language. His \r\nelegy to William Butler Yeats is another.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoem #18:\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\nA noiseless patient spider,\r\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\r\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\r\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\r\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\r\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\r\n\r\nA Noiseless Patient Spider is a wonderfully mystical poem by America\'s Merlin. You can find a number of his poems on the Masters page of\r\nThe HyperTexts.\r\n\r\nPoem #17: Those Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\nRobert Hayden is probably an unknown or undervalued poet to most readers today, \r\nbut every reader should be intimately familiar with this wonderful poem. Those \r\nWinter Sundays illustrates how one poem can make a poet immortal. I may never \r\nremember another poem by Hayden, but I will certainly never forget this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #16: The Broken Tower\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\r\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\r\nOf a spent day  to wander the cathedral lawn\r\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\r\n\r\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\r\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\r\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\r\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\r\n\r\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\r\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\r\n\r\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\r\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\r\nPagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping \r\nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\r\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\r\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\r\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\r\n\r\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thigh embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hope  cleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)  or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)  but slip\r\nOf pebbles,  visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #15: Dulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\n    from Horace\'s Odes and  means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\n    to die for one\'s country. This is one of the first and best \r\nultra-realistic anti-war poems in the English language. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #14:\r\n\r\nin Just-by e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nin Just-\r\nspring when the world is mud-\r\nluscious the little\r\nlame baloonman\r\n\r\nwhistles far and wee\r\n\r\nand eddieandbill come\r\nrunning from marbles and\r\npiracies and it\'s\r\nspring\r\n\r\nwhen the world is puddle-wonderful\r\n\r\nthe queer\r\nold baloonman whistles\r\nfar and wee\r\nand bettyandisbel come dancing\r\n\r\nfrom hop-scotch and jump-rope and\r\nit\'s\r\nspring\r\nand\r\n\r\n the\r\ngoat-footed\r\n\r\nbaloonMan whistles\r\nfar\r\nand\r\nwee\r\n\r\nE. E. Cummings (or e. e. cummings) has long been one of my favorite poets. I \r\nlove his musicality, his whimsy, and his defiance of convention. In his darker \r\npoems like I sing of Olaf, glad and big, I love his fierce wrath against \r\ninjustice. In my opinion he is one of the major poets of the modern era.\r\n    Several of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #13:\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\n\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\n\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\n\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\n\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost wrote a number of magnificent poems, including Directive, \r\nAcquainted with the Night and The Most of It. Directive is one of the \r\nscariest pieces of writing in the English language: much scarier than anything \r\nwritten by Poe or Stephen King, in my opinion. Frost stands out among his peers \r\nbecause he wrote so many great and near-great poems, and may be rivaled only by \r\nW. B. Yeats and Wallace Stevens among modern poets. You can find a number of his \r\npoems on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #12: \r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #11:\r\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\r\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\r\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\r\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\r\n\r\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\r\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\r\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\r\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\r\n\r\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\r\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\r\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\r\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\r\n\r\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\r\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\r\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\r\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\r\n\r\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\r\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\r\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\r\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallace Stevens is one of the very best modern poets, if not the best. My \r\nfavorites among his poems include Sunday Morning, The Snow Man, The Man \r\nWhose Pharynx Was Bad and Tea at the Palaz of Hoon. Some of his poems seem \r\noverly obscure to me, and I find it hard to understand why anyone likes (or \r\npretends to like) his jar in Tennessee stuff, but for sheer music and the \r\nbeauty of words, Stevens is hard to beat. Several of his poems can be found on \r\nthe \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #10:\r\n\r\nSong for the Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #9:\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Persian\r\n\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not wish to know\r\nThe depths of your terrible jungle:\r\nFrom what nest your leopard leaps\r\nOr what sterile lianas are at once your serpents\' disguise and home.\r\n\r\nI am the dweller on the temperate threshold,\r\nThe strip of corn and vine,\r\nWhere all is translucence (the light!)\r\nLiquidity, and the sound of water.\r\nHere the days pass under shade\r\nAnd the nights have the waxing and the waning moon.\r\nHere the moths take flight at evening;\r\nHere at morning the dove whistles and the pigeons coo.\r\nHere, as night comes on, the fireflies wink and snap\r\nClose to the cool ground,\r\nShining in a profusion\r\nCelestial or marine.\r\n\r\nHere it is never wholly dark but always wholly green,\r\nAnd the day stains with what seems to be more than the\r\n sun\r\nWhat may be more than my flesh.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI have wept with the spring storm; \r\n\r\nBurned with the brutal summer.\r\nNow, hearing the wind and the twanging bow-strings,\r\nI know what winter brings.\r\n\r\nThe hunt sweeps out upon the plain\r\nAnd the garden darkens.\r\nThey will bring the trophies home\r\nTo bleed and perish\r\nBeside the trellis and the lattices,\r\nBeside the fountain, still flinging diamond water,\r\nBeside the pool\r\n(Which is eight-sided, like my heart).\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAll has been translated into treasure: \r\n\r\nWeightless as amber,\r\nTranslucent as the currant on the branch,\r\nDark as the rose\'s thorn.\r\n\r\nWhere is the shimmer of evil?\r\nThis is the shell\'s iridescence\r\nAnd the wild bird\'s wing.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIgnorant, I took up my burden in the wilderness.\r\nWise with great wisdom, I shall lay it down upon flowers.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGoodbye, goodbye!\r\nThere was so much to love, I could not love it all;\r\nI could not love it enough.\r\n\r\nSome things I overlooked, and some I could not find.\r\nLet the crystal clasp them\r\nWhen you drink your wine, in autumn.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is one of the best unknown or under-known poets of all time. Her \r\nbest poems make her a major poet, in my opinion. She\'s a poet who deserves to be \r\nread and studied. In particular, her After the Persian, Juan\'s Song \r\nand Song for the Last Act are must reads. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #8:\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\nDover Beach may be the first modern poem. When Arnold speaks of the Sea of \r\nFaith retreating, he seems to be setting the stage for Modernism, which to some \r\ndegree was the reaction of men who began to increasingly suspect that the \r\nwisdom contained in the Bible was hardly the revelation of an all-knowing God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #7:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\nW. B. Yeats is probably the last of the great Romantics, and the first of the \r\ngreat Modernists. He wrote a good number of truly great poems, and remains an \r\nessential poet of the highest rank. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #6:\r\n\r\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\r\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\r\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\r\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\r\n\r\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\r\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\r\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\r\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\r\n\r\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\r\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\r\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\r\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\r\n\r\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\r\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\r\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\r\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\r\n\r\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\r\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\r\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\r\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\r\n\r\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\r\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\r\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\r\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\r\n\r\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\r\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\r\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\r\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\r\n\r\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\r\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\r\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\r\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\r\n\r\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\r\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\r\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\r\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\r\n\r\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\r\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\r\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\r\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\r\n\r\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\r\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\r\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\r\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\r\n\r\nPoem #5:\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde was the most notorious of English poets, because he was \r\nWilde-ly outspoken and flagrantly gay at a time when English society was \r\nmurderously homophobic. Despite being one of London\'s most successful \r\nplaywrights, Wilde was sentenced to two years\' hard labor in Reading Gaol for \r\npracticing gross indecency. After being released from prison, he set sail for \r\nDieppe by the night ferry, never to return to Ireland or Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #4 (tie):\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Musicby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nBread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nConrad Aiken, in his best poems, rivals Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \r\nmasters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s Bread and Music is one of my \r\nvery favorite poems, regardless of era.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n    \r\nPoem #4 (tie): \r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato. The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels than for his poetry, but Piano \r\nis an immortal poem, and thus makes Lawrence an immortal poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \r\n\tPoem #4 (tie):\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\t\r\n\tShelley\'s Music When Soft Voices Die has some of the sweetest, most tender \r\n\tsounds in English poetry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n    \r\nPoem #3: \r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\n\r\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n   \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n   \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n     \r\n   \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n     \r\n   \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n\r\nErnest Dowson\'s influence on T. S. Eliot is obvious, and anyone who reads his \r\nbest poems can easily understand the attraction. Other writers unabashedly \r\nborrowed phrases from Dowson: gone with the wind, the days of wine and \r\nroses, hollow lands, etc. The best poets write memorable lines, and Dowson\'s \r\nbest poems are full of memorable lines. \r\n    \r\nSeveral of his poems can be found on the \r\nMasters \r\npage of The HyperTexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #2 (tie):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song\r\nAnonymous ballad, circa 1620\r\n\r\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\r\nThat into rags would rend ye,\r\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\r\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\r\nThat of your five sound senses\r\nYou never be forsaken,\r\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\r\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nOf thirty bare years have I\r\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\r\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\r\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\r\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\r\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\r\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\r\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\r\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\r\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\r\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\r\nI befell into this dotage.\r\nI slept not since the Conquest,\r\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\r\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\r\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\r\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\r\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\r\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\r\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\r\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\r\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\r\nMe music to my sorrow.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\r\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\r\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\r\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\r\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\r\nI sup, and when benighted,\r\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\r\nYet never am affrighted.\r\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nI know more than Apollo,\r\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\r\nI see the stars at mortal wars\r\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\r\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\r\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\r\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\r\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\r\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\r\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\r\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\r\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\r\nMe handle not nor spare not;\r\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\r\nDo what the panther dare not.\r\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith an host of furious fancies,\r\nWhereof I am commander,\r\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\r\nTo the wilderness I wander.\r\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\r\nI summoned am to tourney\r\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\r\nMethinks it is no journey.\r\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nAnyone who hasn\'t read Tom O\'Bedlam hasn\'t really lived.

Both of them are lost.\r\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\r\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\r\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\r\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\r\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\r\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\r\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\r\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\r\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\r\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\r\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\r\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\r\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\r\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\r\nA brook that was the water of the house,\r\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\r\nToo lofty and original to rage.\r\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\r\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\r\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\r\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\r\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\r\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\r\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\r\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\r\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\r\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn my opinion this is the scariest poem in the English language, and doubly \r\n\tso because multitudes of children have actually lived through such \r\n\texperiences. In Directive, Robert Frost shows us the horror of children \r\n\tgrowing up under the dark cloud of Christianity, with its guide who only has at heart your getting lost, \r\n\tbecause according to the Bible most human beings are predestined for an \r\n\teternal hell. According to Saint Mark (considered by many Christians to be \r\n\tthe author of the Gospel of Mark), Jesus spoke in parables to the common \r\n\tfolk in order to deliberately mislead them, so they wouldn\'t be saved. Frost \r\n\timplores us to Weep for what little things could make them glad, knowing \r\n\thow very difficult it is for children to be happy when their parents have \r\n\tsuch dark visions of God. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n    \r\n\t\r\n\tPoem #2 (tie):\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Love Song of J.

and, Do I dare?\r\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\r\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\r\n[They will say: How his hair is growing thin!]\r\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\r\n[They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!]\r\nDo I dare\r\nDisturb the universe?\r\nIn a minute there is time\r\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\n For I have known them all already, known them all:\r\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\r\n So how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the eyes already, known them all-\r\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\nThen how should I begin\r\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n And how should I presume?\r\n\r\n And I have known the arms already, known them all-\r\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]\r\nIt is perfume from a dress\r\nThat makes me so digress?\r\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n And should I then presume?\r\n And how should I begin?\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n. .\r\n\r\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .\r\n\r\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n. .\r\n\r\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\r\nSmoothed by long fingers,\r\nAsleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,\r\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\r\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\r\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\nThough I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,\r\nI am no prophetand here\'s no great matter;\r\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\nTo say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\r\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n Should say: That is not what I meant at all.\r\n That is not it, at all.\r\n\r\n And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\nWould it have been worth while,\r\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the \r\nfloor\r\nAnd this, and so much more?\r\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\nWould it have been worth while\r\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\r\n That is not it at all,\r\n That is not what I meant, at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n. .\r\n\r\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\r\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\r\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\r\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\r\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\r\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\r\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\r\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\r\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\r\n\r\nI grow old . . . I grow old . . .\r\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\r\n\r\n Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\r\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\r\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\r\n\r\n I do not think that they will sing to me.\r\n\r\n I have seen them riding seaward on the waves\r\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\r\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\r\n\r\n We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\r\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\r\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\r\n\r\n[1] Dante, Inferno 27.61-66 If I thought my answer were given / to anyone who \r\nwould ever return to the world, / this flame would stand still without moving \r\nany further. / But since never from this abyss / has anyone ever returned alive, \r\nif what I hear is true, /without fear of infamy I answer you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare invented the modern human, as Harold Bloom has suggested, then \r\nperhaps T. S. Eliot invented the modern poet, with his creation of Prufrock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #2 (tie):\r\n\r\n\r\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\r\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\r\n\r\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\'s shade,\r\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,\r\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\r\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\r\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\r\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\r\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\r\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\r\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share,\r\n\r\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\r\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\r\nHow bow\'d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\r\n\r\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\r\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\r\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\r\nThe short and simple annals of the Poor.\r\n\r\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\r\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\r\nAwaits alike th\' inevitable hour:\r\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\r\n\r\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault\r\nIf Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise,\r\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\r\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\r\n\r\nCan storied urn or animated bust\r\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\nCan Honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\nOr Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\r\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\r\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\'d,\r\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\r\n\r\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\r\nRich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\r\nChill Penury repress\'d their noble rage,\r\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\r\n\r\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene\r\nThe dark unfathom\'d caves of ocean bear:\r\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\r\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,\r\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\r\nSome Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\r\n\r\nTh\' applause of list\'ning senates to command,\r\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\r\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\r\nAnd read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\r\n\r\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone\r\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\r\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\r\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\r\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\r\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\r\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\r\n\r\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\r\nTheir sober wishes never learn\'d to stray;\r\nAlong the cool sequester\'d vale of life\r\nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.\r\n\r\nYet e\'en these bones from insult to protect\r\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\r\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck\'d,\r\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\r\n\r\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th\' unletter\'d Muse,\r\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\r\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\r\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\r\n\r\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\r\nThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resign\'d,\r\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\r\nNor cast one longing lingering look behind?\r\n\r\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\r\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\r\nE\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\r\n\r\nFor thee, who, mindful of th\' unhonour\'d dead,\r\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\r\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\r\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\r\n\r\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\r\nOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\r\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,\r\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn;\r\n\r\n\'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\r\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.\r\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\r\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\r\n\r\n\'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\r\nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;\r\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\r\nOr crazed with care, or cross\'d in hopeless love.\r\n\r\n\'One morn I miss\'d him on the custom\'d hill,\r\nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;\r\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\r\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\r\n\r\n\'The next with dirges due in sad array\r\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\r\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\r\nGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\'\r\n\r\nThe Epitaph\r\n\r\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\r\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\r\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\r\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own.\r\n\r\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\r\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\r\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\r\nHe gained from Heaven (\'twas all he wish\'d) a friend.\r\n\r\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\r\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode\r\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\r\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Gray\'s magnificent elegy to a dead rustic youth remains one of the great \r\npoems of the English language, and an inexplicable wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoem #2 (tie):\r\nOde : Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\r\nby William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\r\nThe earth, and every common sight,\r\nTo me did seem\r\nApparell\'d in celestial light,\r\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\r\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore;\r\nTurn wheresoe\'er I may,\r\nBy night or day,\r\nThe things which I have seen I now can see no more.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow comes and goes,\r\nAnd lovely is the rose;\r\nThe moon doth with delight\r\nLook round her when the heavens are bare;\r\nWaters on a starry night\r\nAre beautiful and fair;\r\nThe sunshine is a glorious birth;\r\nBut yet I know, where\'er I go,\r\nThat there hath pass\'d away a glory from the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,\r\nAnd while the young lambs bound\r\nAs to the tabor\'s sound,\r\nTo me alone there came a thought of grief:\r\nA timely utterance gave that thought relief,\r\nAnd I again am strong:\r\nThe cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;\r\nNo more shall grief of mine the season wrong;\r\nI hear the echoes through the mountains throng,\r\n\r\nThe winds come to me from the fields of sleep,\r\nAnd all the earth is gay;\r\nLand and sea\r\nGive themselves up to jollity,\r\nAnd with the heart of May\r\nDoth every beast keep holiday;\r\nThou Child of Joy,\r\nShout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!\r\n\r\nYe bless\xe8d creatures, I have heard the call\r\nYe to each other make; I see\r\nThe heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;\r\nMy heart is at your festival,\r\nMy head hath its coronal,\r\nThe fulness of your bliss, I feelI feel it all.\r\nO evil day! if I were sullen\r\nWhile Earth herself is adorning,\r\nThis sweet May-morning,\r\nAnd the children are culling\r\nOn every side,\r\nIn a thousand valleys far and wide,\r\nFresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,\r\nAnd the babe leaps up on his mother\'s arm:\r\nI hear, I hear, with joy I hear!\r\nBut there\'s a tree, of many, one,\r\nA single field which I have look\'d upon,\r\nBoth of them speak of something that is gone:\r\nThe pansy at my feet\r\nDoth the same tale repeat:\r\nWhither is fled the visionary gleam?\r\nWhere is it now, the glory and the dream?\r\n\r\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\r\nThe Soul that rises with us, our life\'s Star,\r\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\r\nAnd cometh from afar:\r\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\r\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\r\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\nFrom God, who is our home:\r\nHeaven lies about us in our infancy!\r\nShades of the prison-house begin to close\r\nUpon the growing Boy,\r\nBut he \r\nBeholds the light, and whence it flows,\r\nHe sees it in his joy;\r\nThe Youth, who daily farther from the east\r\nMust travel, still is Nature\'s priest,\r\nAnd by the vision splendid\r\nIs on his way attended;\r\nAt length the Man perceives it die away,\r\nAnd fade into the light of common day.\r\n\r\nEarth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;\r\nYearnings she hath in her own natural kind,\r\nAnd, even with something of a mother\'s mind,\r\nAnd no unworthy aim,\r\nThe homely nurse doth all she can\r\nTo make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,\r\nForget the glories he hath known,\r\nAnd that imperial palace whence he came.\r\n\r\nBehold the Child among his new-born blisses,\r\nA six years\' darling of a pigmy size!\r\nSee, where \'mid work of his own hand he lies,\r\nFretted by sallies of his mother\'s kisses,\r\nWith light upon him from his father\'s eyes!\r\nSee, at his feet, some little plan or chart,\r\nSome fragment from his dream of human life,\r\nShaped by himself with newly-learn\xe8d art;\r\nA wedding or a festival,\r\nA mourning or a funeral;\r\nAnd this hath now his heart,\r\nAnd unto this he frames his song:\r\nThen will he fit his tongue\r\nTo dialogues of business, love, or strife;\r\nBut it will not be long\r\nEre this be thrown aside,\r\nAnd with new joy and pride\r\nThe little actor cons another part;\r\nFilling from time to time his \'humorous stage\'\r\nWith all the Persons, down to palsied Age,\r\nThat Life brings with her in her equipage;\r\nAs if his whole vocation\r\nWere endless imitation.\r\n\r\nThou, whose exterior semblance doth belie\r\nThy soul\'s immensity;\r\nThou best philosopher, who yet dost keep\r\nThy heritage, thou eye among the blind,\r\nThat, deaf and silent, read\'st the eternal deep,\r\nHaunted for ever by the eternal mind,\r\nMighty prophet! Seer blest!\r\nOn whom those truths do rest,\r\nWhich we are toiling all our lives to find,\r\nIn darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;\r\nThou, over whom thy Immortality\r\nBroods like the Day, a master o\'er a slave,\r\nA presence which is not to be put by;\r\nTo whom the grave\r\nIs but a lonely bed without the sense or sight\r\nOf day or the warm light,\r\nA place of thought where we in waiting lie;\r\nThou little Child, yet glorious in the might\r\nOf heaven-born freedom on thy being\'s height,\r\nWhy with such earnest pains dost thou provoke\r\nThe years to bring the inevitable yoke,\r\nThus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?\r\nFull soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,\r\nAnd custom lie upon thee with a weight,\r\nHeavy as frost, and deep almost as life!\r\n\r\nO joy! that in our embers\r\nIs something that doth live,\r\nThat nature yet remembers\r\nWhat was so fugitive!\r\nThe thought of our past years in me doth breed\r\nPerpetual benediction: not indeed\r\nFor that which is most worthy to be blest\r\nDelight and liberty, the simple creed\r\nOf childhood, whether busy or at rest,\r\nWith new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:\r\nNot for these I raise\r\nThe song of thanks and praise;\r\nBut for those obstinate questionings\r\nOf sense and outward things,\r\nFallings from us, vanishings;\r\nBlank misgivings of a Creature\r\nMoving about in worlds not realized,\r\nHigh instincts before which our mortal Nature\r\nDid tremble like a guilty thing surprised:\r\nBut for those first affections,\r\nThose shadowy recollections,\r\nWhich, be they what they may,\r\nAre yet the fountain-light of all our day,\r\nAre yet a master-light of all our seeing;\r\nUphold us, cherish, and have power to make\r\nOur noisy years seem moments in the being\r\nOf the eternal Silence: truths that wake,\r\nTo perish never:\r\nWhich neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,\r\nNor Man nor Boy,\r\nNor all that is at enmity with joy,\r\nCan utterly abolish or destroy!\r\nHence in a season of calm weather\r\nThough inland far we be,\r\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\r\nWhich brought us hither,\r\nCan in a moment travel thither,\r\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\r\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\r\n\r\nThen sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!\r\nAnd let the young lambs bound\r\nAs to the tabor\'s sound!\r\nWe in thought will join your throng,\r\nYe that pipe and ye that play,\r\nYe that through your hearts to-day\r\nFeel the gladness of the May!\r\nWhat though the radiance which was once so bright\r\nBe now for ever taken from my sight,\r\nThough nothing can bring back the hour\r\nOf splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\r\nWe will grieve not, rather find\r\nStrength in what remains behind;\r\nIn the primal sympathy\r\nWhich having been must ever be;\r\nIn the soothing thoughts that spring\r\nOut of human suffering;\r\nIn the faith that looks through death,\r\nIn years that bring the philosophic mind.\r\n\r\nAnd O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,\r\nForebode not any severing of our loves!\r\nYet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;\r\nI only have relinquish\'d one delight\r\nTo live beneath your more habitual sway.\r\nI love the brooks which down their channels fret,\r\nEven more than when I tripp\'d lightly as they;\r\nThe innocent brightness of a new-born Day\r\nIs lovely yet;\r\nThe clouds that gather round the setting sun\r\nDo take a sober colouring from an eye\r\nThat hath kept watch o\'er man\'s mortality;\r\nAnother race hath been, and other palms are won.\r\nThanks to the human heart by which we live,\r\nThanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,\r\nTo me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\nThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wordsworth\'s poem about his childhood intimations of immorality is at \r\nonce the most mystical and philosophical of poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPoem #1:\r\n\r\n\r\nVoyages\r\n\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nAbove the fresh ruffles of the surf\r\nBright striped urchins flay each other with sand. \r\n\r\nThey have contrived a conquest for shell shucks, \r\n\r\nAnd their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed \r\n\r\nGaily digging and scattering.\r\n\r\nAnd in answer to their treble interjections \r\n\r\nThe sun beats lightning on the waves,\r\nThe waves fold thunder on the sand;\r\nAnd could they hear me I would tell them: \r\n\r\n\r\nO brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,\r\nFondle your shells and sticks, bleached\r\nBy time and the elements; but there is a line \r\n\r\nYou must not cross nor ever trust beyond it \r\n\r\nSpry cordage of your bodies to caresses\r\nToo lichen-faithful from too wide a breast. \r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea is cruel.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAnd yet this great wink of eternity,\r\nOf rimless floods, unfettered leewardings, \r\n\r\nSamite sheeted and processioned where\r\nHer undinal vast belly moonward bends,\r\nLaughing the wrapt inflections of our love; \r\n\r\n\r\nTake this Sea, whose diapason knells\r\nOn scrolls of silver snowy sentences,\r\nThe sceptred terror of whose sessions rends \r\n\r\nAs her demeanors motion well or ill,\r\nAll but the pieties of lovers hands.\r\n\r\nAnd onward, as bells off San Salvador\r\nSalute the crocus lustres of the stars,\r\nIn these poinsettia meadows of her tides, \r\n\r\nAdagios of islands, O my Prodigal,\r\nComplete the dark confessions her veins spell. \r\n\r\n\r\nMark how her turning shoulders wind the hours, \r\n\r\nAnd hasten while her penniless rich palms \r\n\r\nPass superscription of bent foam and wave, \r\n\r\nHasten, while they are true,sleep, death, desire, \r\n\r\nClose round one instant in one floating flower. \r\n\r\n\r\nBind us in time, O Seasons clear, and awe. \r\n\r\nO minstrel galleons of Carib fire,\r\nBequeath us to no earthly shore until\r\nIs answered in the vortex of our grave\r\nThe seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise. \r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nInfinite consanguinity it bears\r\nThis tendered theme of you that light\r\nRetrieves from sea plains where the sky\r\nResigns a breast that every wave enthrones; \r\n\r\nWhile ribboned water lanes I wind\r\nAre laved and scattered with no stroke\r\nWide from your side, whereto this hour\r\nThe sea lifts, also, reliquary hands.\r\n\r\nAnd so, admitted through black swollen gates\r\nThat must arrest all distance otherwise,\r\nPast whirling pillars and lithe pediments,\r\nLight wrestling there incessantly with light,\r\nStar kissing star through wave on wave unto\r\nYour body rocking!\r\nand where death, if shed,\r\nPresumes no carnage, but this single change,\r\nUpon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn\r\nThe silken skilled transmemberment of song;\r\n\r\nPermit me voyage, love, into your hands ...\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhose counted smile of hours and days, suppose\r\nI know as spectrum of the sea and pledge\r\nVastly now parting gulf on gulf of wings\r\nWhose circles bridge, I know, (from palms to the severe \r\n\r\nChilled albatrosss white immutability)\r\nNo stream of greater love advancing now\r\nThan, singing, this mortality alone\r\nThrough clay aflow immortally to you.\r\n\r\nAll fragrance irrefragably, and claim\r\nMadly meeting logically in this hour\r\nAnd region that is ours to wreathe again,\r\nPortending eyes and lips and making told\r\nThe chancel port and portion of our June\r\n\r\nShall they not stem and close in our own steps\r\nBright staves of flowers and quills today as I\r\nMust first be lost in fatal tides to tell?\r\n\r\nIn signature of the incarnate word\r\nThe harbor shoulders to resign in mingling\r\nMutual blood, transpiring as foreknown\r\nAnd widening noon within your breast for gathering\r\nAll bright insinuations that my years have caught\r\nFor islands where must lead inviolably\r\nBlue latitudes and levels of your eyes,\r\n\r\nIn this expectant, still exclaim receive\r\nThe secret oar and petals of all love.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMeticulous, past midnight in clear rime,\r\nInfrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast\r\nTogether in one merciless white blade\r\nThe bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.\r\n\r\nAs if too brittle or too clear to touch!\r\nThe cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,\r\nAlready hang, shred ends from remembered stars.\r\nOne frozen trackless smile ... What words\r\nCan strangle this deaf moonlight? For we\r\n\r\nAre overtaken. Now no cry, no sword\r\nCan fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,\r\nSlow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved\r\nAnd changed ... Theres\r\n\r\nNothing like this in the world, you say,\r\nKnowing I cannot touch your hand and look\r\nToo, into that godless cleft of sky\r\nWhere nothing turns but dead sands flashing.\r\n\r\nAnd never to quite understand! No,\r\nIn all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed\r\nNothing so flagless as this piracy.\r\n\r\nBut now\r\nDraw in your head, alone and too tall here.\r\nYour eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;\r\nYour breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:\r\nDraw in your head and sleep the long way home.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhere icy and bright dungeons lift\r\nOf swimmers their lost morning eyes,\r\nAnd ocean rivers, churning, shift\r\nGreen borders under stranger skies,\r\n\r\nSteadily as a shell secretes\r\nIts beating leagues of monotone,\r\nOr as many waters trough the suns\r\nRed kelson past the capes wet stone;\r\n\r\nO rivers mingling toward the sky\r\nAnd harbor of the phoenix breast\r\nMy eyes pressed black against the prow,\r\nThy derelict and blinded guest\r\n\r\nWaiting, afire, what name, unspoke,\r\nI cannot claim: let thy waves rear\r\nMore savage than the death of kings,\r\nSome splintered garland for the seer.\r\n\r\nBeyond siroccos harvesting\r\nThe solstice thunders, crept away,\r\nLike a cliff swinging or a sail\r\nFlung into Aprils inmost day\r\n\r\nCreations blithe and petalled word\r\nTo the lounged goddess when she rose\r\nConceding dialogue with eyes\r\nThat smile unsearchable repose\r\n\r\nStill fervid covenant, Belle Isle,\r\nUnfolded floating dais before\r\nWhich rainbows twine continual hair\r\nBelle Isle, white echo of the oar!\r\n\r\nThe imaged Word, it is, that holds\r\nHushed willows anchored in its glow.\r\nIt is the unbetrayable reply\r\nWhose accent no farewell can know.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Hart Crane\'s Voyages is the best love poem of all time, and the \r\nsecond-best love poem isn\'t even close. It\'s also my choice as the best poem \r\never written in the English language. Hart Crane was an uneven poet who \r\nsometimes borders on being unreadable, but in his best poems, he\'s a wonder. \r\nOther poems of his such as To Brooklyn Bridge and The Broken Tower \r\nalso rank with \r\nthe best poems in the English language. But please keep in mind that these are \r\nonly my personal choices, and therefore matters of opinion. \r\n\r\nSo there you have them: the best poems ever written, and the greatest poem of \r\nall time, according to me. I\'m sure every \r\nreader\'s choices will be different, but if you added a poem or three to your \r\nlist of favorites, \r\nhaving read mine, hopefully you will consider your time here well spent. \r\n\r\nHigh\r\nHonorable Mentions:\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nTichborne\'s elegy to himself, written in the Tower of London as he awaited \r\nexecution, remains one of the most powerful in the \r\nEnglish language. That a poem this good is number 50 bodes well for \r\nthe rest of the countdown ...\r\n\r\nThe Lie\r\nby Sir Walter Ralegh\r\n\r\nGo, soul, the body\'s guest,\r\nUpon a thankless errand;\r\nFear not to touch the best;\r\nThe truth shall be thy warrant:\r\nGo, since I needs must die,\r\nAnd give the world the lie.\r\n\r\nSay to the court it glows\r\nAnd shines like rotten wood,\r\nSay to the church it shows\r\nWhat\'s good, and doth no good:\r\nIf church and court reply,\r\nThen give them both the lie ...\r\n\r\nTwo of the best elegies in the English language were written by poets to \r\nthemselves as they awaited execution in the Tower of London. Chidiock Tichborne \r\nwould be unknown today if not for the swan song he penned to himself, but Sir \r\nWalter Ralegh was the Richard Branson of his era. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer \r\nby Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the learn\'d astronomer,\r\nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\r\nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\r\nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the \r\nlecture-room,\r\nHow soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\r\nTill rising and gliding out I wander\'d off by myself,\r\nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\r\nLook\'d up in perfect silence at the stars.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman is one of the most important poets of all time, not only because \r\nhis best poems are masterpieces, but because of his influence on other poets, \r\nand on the modern psyche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet 147\r\n\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nMy love is as a fever, longing still\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest.\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\'s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed,\r\n For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\n Who art as black as Hell, as dark as night.\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite of Shakespeare\'s Dark Lady sonnets.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Confession \r\n\r\n\r\nby the Archpoet\r\ncirca 1165; translated from the original medieval Latin by Helen Waddell\r\n\r\nSeething over inwardly\r\nwith fierce indignation,\r\nIn my bitterness of soul,\r\nHear my declaration.\r\nI am of one element,\r\nLevity my matter,\r\nLike enough a withered leaf\r\nFor the winds to scatter.\r\n\r\nSince it is the property\r\nOf the sapient\r\nTo sit firm upon a rock,\r\nit is evident\r\nThat I am a fool, since I\r\nAm a flowing river,\r\nNever under the same sky,\r\nTransient for ever.\r\n\r\nHither, thither, masterless\r\nShip upon the sea,\r\nWandering through the ways of air,\r\nGo the birds like me.\r\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\r\nPrisoner to no key,\r\nQuesting go I for my kind,\r\nFind depravity.\r\n\r\nNever yet could I endure\r\nSoberness and sadness,\r\nJests I love and sweeter than\r\nHoney find I gladness.\r\nWhatsoever Venus bids\r\nIs a joy excelling,\r\nNever in an evil heart\r\nDid she make her dwelling.\r\n\r\nDown the broad way do I go,\r\nYoung and unregretting,\r\nWrap me in my vices up,\r\nVirtue all forgetting,\r\nGreedier for all delight\r\nThan heaven to enter in:\r\nSince the soul is in me dead,\r\nBetter save the skin.\r\n\r\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\r\nMaster of discretion,\r\nBut this death I die is sweet,\r\nMost delicious poison.\r\nWounded to the quick am I\r\nBy a young girl\'s beauty:\r\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\r\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\r\n\r\nHard beyond all hardness, this\r\nMastering of Nature:\r\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\r\nNear so fair a creature?\r\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\r\nHow should we obey it?\r\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\r\nShall they have no say int?\r\n\r\nSit you down amid the fire,\r\nWill the fire not burn you?\r\nTo Pavia come, will you\r\nJust as chaste return you?\r\nPavia, where Beauty draws\r\nYouth with finger-tips,\r\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\r\nRavished with her lips.\r\n\r\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\r\nIn Pavia dine him,\r\nNever more Hippolytus\r\nWill the morning find him.\r\nIn Pavia not a road\r\nBut leads to venery\r\nNor among its crowding towers\r\nOne to chastity.\r\n\r\nYet a second charge they bring:\r\nI\'m forever gaming.\r\nYea, the dice hath many a time\r\nStripped me to my shaming.\r\nWhat an\' if the body\'s cold,\r\nIf the mind is burning,\r\nOn the anvil hammering,\r\nRhymes and verses turning?\r\n\r\nLook again upon your list.\r\nIs the tavern on it?\r\nYea, and never have I scorned,\r\nNever shall I scorn it,\r\nTill the holy angels come,\r\nAnd my eyes discern them,\r\nSinging for the dying soul,\r\nRequiem aeternam.\r\n\r\nFor on this my heart is set:\r\nWhen the hour is nigh me,\r\nLet me in the tavern die,\r\nWith a tankard by me,\r\nWhile the angels looking down\r\nJoyously sing o\'er me,\r\nDeus sit propitius\r\nHuic potatori.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\r\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\r\n\'Tis the heart that drenched in wine\r\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\r\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\r\nIn a tavern tankard\r\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\r\nBishop has decanted.\r\n\r\nLet them fast and water drink,\r\nAll the poets\' chorus,\r\nFly the market and the crowd\r\nRacketing uproarious.\r\nSit in quiet spots and think,\r\nShun the tavern\'s portal\r\nWrite, and never having lived,\r\nDie to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNever hath the spirit of\r\nPoetry descended,\r\nTill with food and drink my lean\r\nBelly was distended,\r\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\r\nMy cerebral story,\r\nComes Apollo with a rush,\r\nFills me with his glory.\r\n\r\nUnto every man his gift.\r\nMine was not for fasting.\r\nNever could I find a rhyme\r\nWith my stomach wasting.\r\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\r\n\'Tis a better chorus\r\nWhen the landlord hath a good\r\nVintage set before us.\r\n\r\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\r\nI myself betray me,\r\nAnd affirm myself to be\r\nAll my fellows say me.\r\nSee, they in thy presence are:\r\nLet whoeer hath known\r\nHis own heart and found it clean,\r\nCast at me the stone.\r\n\r\nThe Archpoet should be required reading! He is simultaneously funny, irreverent \r\nand wise. He wrote on the cusp of the Inquisition, which probably explains his \r\nuse of a pseudonym.\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nBest \r\nPoets, Best Lyric Poetry,\r\nBest Free \r\nVerse, Best Love Poetry,\r\nBest Sad/Dark Poetry,\r\nBest Political Poetry,\r\nBest Christmas Poetry,\r\nBest Christmas \r\nSongs,\r\nBest Christian Poetry,\r\nBest Religious Poetry,\r\nBest Spiritual Poetry, \r\nBest Heretical \r\nPoetry, \r\nBest Poetry Translations,\r\nBest Songs,\r\nBest Rock \r\nLyrics,\r\n\r\nBest Old English Poetry, Best Arthurian \r\nPoetry, Best Epigrams,\r\nBest Esoterica, Best \r\nEssays  Assays, Best \r\nFall/Autumn Poetry, Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nBest Haiku,\r\nBest Hiroshima Poetry,\r\nBest Holocaust Poetry,\r\n\r\nBest Anti-War Poetry,\r\nBest of the Masters,\r\nBest Early Poems,\r\nBest \r\nPalestinian Poetry, Best Sappho \r\nTranslations, \r\nBest Thanksgiving Poetry,\r\nThe \r\nMost Beautiful Poems in the English Language,\r\nBest \r\nFemale Singer-Songwriters,\r\nBest Homeless Poetry,\r\nBest Insults\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
