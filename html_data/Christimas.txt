How can such Christians honestly explain Bible verses in which Moses \ncommanded the stoning of girls who had been raped (Deuteronomy 22), the stoning \nof boys for being stubborn (Deuteronomy 21), or the slaughter of captured \nmothers and their male babies, with only the virgin girls being kept alive as \nsex slaves (Numbers 31)? In one of the darkest, most horrendous chapters of the \nBible (Exodus 21), Moses allowed fathers to sell their own daughters as sex slaves, with the \noption to buy them back if they didn\'t please their new masters! While many \nChristians maintain that the New Testament is better than the Old \nTestament, the grotesque book of \nRevelation says that Jesus will murder children if their mothers have \nextramarital sex, and that human beings will be tortured with fire and brimstone \nin the presence of the Lamb and Holy Angels. So much for hell being the \nabsence of God! According to John of Patmos, the writer of Revelation, Christian saints will cry for vengeance \nand blood, rather than for mercy and compassion, and there will be a torture chamber in heaven, at \nthe foot of the throne of God! The poems below examine \nthe holy folly of God (or is it only the unholy folly of religion)? And for good \nmeasure, we\'ve thrown in a few Easter poems and other odd heretical fare, to boot.\n\ncompiled\nby Michael R. Burch, a \nrecovering fundamentalist\n\n\n\nForgive, O Lord \nby Robert Frost\n\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\n\n\n\nA Child\x92s Christmas Prayer of Despair for a Hindu Saint \nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSanta Claus,\nfor Christmas, please,\ndon\x92t bring me toys, or games, or candy . . .\njust . . . Santa, please,\nI\x92m on my knees! . . .\nplease\ndon\x92t let Jesus torture Gandhi! \n\n\n\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat would Santa Claus say,\nI wonder,\nabout Jesus returning\nto kill and plunder?\n\nFor he\'ll likely return\non Christmas Day\nto blow the bad\nlittle boys away!\n\nWhen He flashes like lightning\nacross the skies\nand many a homosexual\ndies,\n\nwhen the harlots and heretics\nare ripped asunder,\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\nI wonder?\n\n\n\nA Little Bell\nby Ann Drysdale\n\nA little bell, a little golden bell\nA little golden Christmas-looking bell\nWith Santa on his sleigh, waving goodwill\nWhile six wild reindeer rear into the sky\nMaking a cunning little handle.\n\nIf you take it between finger and thumb\nAnd give it the teeniest shake, it tinkles\nLike babies\' laughter. Such a pretty thing\nAnd it is all for you. Nurse gave it to you\nTo keep for as long as you need it.\n\nNurse gave the bell to you because last night\nYou had a paroxysm of vomiting\nThat made green curtains run down all four walls\nAnd rang the "help me" bell and no-one came\nBecause the bell was broken.\n\nSo you cried out at the top of your voice\nBegging for someone, anyone, to come;\nBut cries of distress on the ward at night\nAre constant and for the most part ignored.\nYou lay ill and afraid alone.\n\nToday I asked if something could be done\nAnd they brought you the little golden bell.\nI went back home and fetched a sleeping bag.\nI will be here tonight and every night.\nBecause I don\'t believe in Santa Claus.\n\n\n\nI - Easter Hymn\nby A. E. Housman\n\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\n\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\n\n\n\nIn God We Trust\nby T. Merrill\n\nAbsolve yourselves, believe them saved,\nWhom hungrily you brought to fare\nAs chance decrees, and leave to them\nThe fortune to which you rose heir.\nNow theirs shall be the kingdom too,\nThis one and that, and all they hold,\nAll marvels present, and as well\nFresh wonders when the flesh turns cold.\n\nAll you who by blind pulse renew\nThe primal blessing cast in heat,\nAnd to a season\'s course entrust\nFrail issue weather can defeat,\nWho from flung seed grew anxious too\nDeny earth feeds on them and you.\n\n\n\nNuns, Skating\nby Ann Drysdale\n\nNuns fret not at their convent\'s narrow room\nBecause their spirits can escape beyond\nThe place that holds them in respectful gloom\nTo seek the Lord beside the frozen pond.\nThere He will make their laughter into bells\nAnd turn their breath to incense. He will show\nShadows of magi on the distant hills\nAnd flights of angels shining in the snow.\nHe will make rushes sing and grasses dance\nTo the intrusive music of their chatter,\nWhispering in their ears that, just this once,\nThey too can walk as He did, on the water.\nOh, may the year to come be full of these\nSmall serendipitous epiphanies.\n\n\n\nWilly Nilly\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the Demiurge aka Yahweh/Jehovah\n\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,\nand now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\nYou forced them to run\nall their days uphilly.\nThey ran till they dropped\nlife\'s a pickle, dilly.\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\nThey say I should worship you!\nOh, really!\nThey say I should pray\nso you\'ll not act illy.\nIsn\'t it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\n\n\nThe Garden Of Love\nby William Blake\n\nI laid me down upon a bank,\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\nI heard among the rushes dank\nWeeping, weeping.\n\nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\n\nI went to the Garden of Love,\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\nWhere I used to play on the green.\n\nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\n\n\n\nAn untitled poem from the novel The Four Men\nby Hilaire Belloc\n\nMay all good fellows that here agree\nDrink Audit Ale in heaven with me.\nAnd may all my enemies go to hell!\nNoel! Noel! Noel! Noel!\nMay all my enemies go to hell!\nNoel! Noel!\n\n\n\nThe Corporate Christmas Carol\nby Joseph S.
