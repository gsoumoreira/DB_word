Was Einstein, perhaps, a major poet who remains \r\nbetter known for other, far less significant thingssmall \r\nthings such as discovering the relativistic nature of time and space? Of course \r\nI\'m teasing, but I will make the case that Albert Einstein was not only a poet, \r\nbut a very romantic poet!  \r\n\r\nA question that sometimes drives me hazy: \r\nam I or are the others crazy?\r\nAlbert Einstein\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein was undoubtedly a poet, in my opinion. \r\nThe poetry of Albert Einstein is merely another aspect of his genius. The \r\nfollowing poems are comprised of quotations by Einstein that I combined into \r\npoems, changing a word here and there for the sake of meter and rhyme, while \r\nhopefully preserving the reason.Michael R.

That\'s why certain people \r\nappear bright until we hear them speak. \r\nOnly two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity (and I\'m not sure \r\nabout the former). \r\nThe difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.\r\nAn intellectualsolves a problem. A genius avoids it.\r\nThe only reason for time is so that everything doesn\'t happen at once. \r\nThe most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all \r\ncomprehensible.\r\nThe hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.\r\nNot everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be \r\ncounted. \r\nGravitation is not responsible for people falling in love! \r\n\r\nAgainst Hubris\r\n\r\nScience without religion is lame,\r\nreligion without science is blind,\r\nand whoever undertakes to establish himself\r\nas the judge of Truth \r\nand Knowledge \r\nis shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.\r\n\r\nWar and Peace\r\n\r\nBut heroism on command, \r\nsenseless violence, \r\nand all the loathsome nonsense \r\nthat goes by the name of patriotism:\r\nhow passionately I hate them!\r\nPerfection of means \r\nand confusion of ends \r\nseem to characterize our age\r\nand it has become appallingly obvious \r\nthat our technology \r\nhas exceeded our humanity,\r\nthat technological progress \r\nis like an axe \r\nin the hands of a pathological criminal,\r\nand that the attempt to combine wisdom \r\nand power \r\nhas only rarely been successful \r\nand then only for a short while.\r\n\r\nIt is my conviction \r\nthat killing under the cloak of war \r\nis nothing but an act of murder.\r\n(I do not know what weapons \r\nWorld War III will be fought with, \r\nbut World War IV will be fought \r\nwith sticks and stones.)\r\n\r\nOh, how I wish that \r\nsomewhere \r\nthere existed an island \r\n\r\nfor those who are wise \r\n\r\nand of goodwill! . . .\r\n\r\nIn such a place even I \r\nwould be an ardent patriot,\r\nfor I am not only a pacifist,\r\nbut a militant pacifist. \r\nI am willing to fight for peace,\r\nfor nothing will end war \r\nunless the people themselves \r\nrefuse to go to war.\r\n\r\nOur task must be to free ourselves \r\nby widening our circle of compassion \r\nto embrace all living creatures \r\nand the whole of nature and its beauty.\r\nAnd peace cannot be kept by force; \r\nit can only be achieved by understanding.\r\n\r\nMystery\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to live your life\r\none is as though nothing is a \r\nmiracle, \r\nthe other is as though everything is a miracle.\r\nThe most beautiful thing we can experience is the \r\nmysterious: \r\nit is the source of all true art and all science.\r\nHe to whom this \r\nemotion is a stranger, \r\nwho can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, \r\n\r\nis as good as dead: his eyes are closed.\r\n\r\nCuriosity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important thing is not to stop questioning. \r\n\r\nCuriosity has its own reason for existing. \r\nOne cannot help but be in awe when he \r\ncontemplates the mysteries of eternity, \r\nof life, of the marvelous structure of \r\nreality. \r\nIt is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery \r\nevery day. \r\nNever lose a holy curiosity.\r\n\r\nPeople do not grow old no matter how long we live. \r\nWe \r\nnever cease to stand like curious children \r\nbefore the great Mystery into which \r\nwe were born.\r\n\r\nCharacter\r\n\r\nGreat spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds\r\nbecause anger dwells only in the bosom of fools\r\nand weakness of attitude soon becomes weakness of character.\r\nOnly two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity (and I\'m not sure \r\nabout the former);\r\nfurthermore, we can\'t solve problems by using the same kind of \r\nthinking we used when we created them.\r\nThe world is a dangerous place: not just because of the \r\npeople who are evil, \r\nbut also because of the good people who don\'t do anything about it.\r\nHe who joyfully marches to music rank and file has \r\nalready earned my contempt:\r\nhe has been given a large brain by mistake, since \r\nfor him the spinal cord would surely suffice.\r\n\r\nEinstein on Palestine\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\ncompiled and edited\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat would Albert Einstein have said about the modern state of Israel, and its treatment of Palestinians? Was he \r\na Zionist, and if so, in what way? \r\n\r\nEinstein said, "Oppressive nationalism must be conquered." He also called \r\nnationalism the "infantile sickness" of the human race. But what about \r\nthe Jewish state of Israel, which has created a system of apartheid designed to \r\ndeny non-Jews the most basic of human rights, such as the right to buy land, the right to due \r\nprocess in fair courts, and the right to marry and raise children without \r\ngovernment interference? Israel\'s government has gone as far as forcing \r\nPalestinian mothers to either leave their native land, or be separated from \r\ntheir own children. Why are Palestinian mothers and their children being forced to \r\nwalk this new Trail of Tears? How can a modern democracy continue to insist that \r\nJewish babies are born with infinitely superior rights to all other babies?\r\n\r\nEinstein opposed both nationalism and racism, saying: "I have conceived of \r\nJudaism as a community of tradition. Both friend and foe, on the other hand, \r\nhave often asserted that the Jews represent a race; that their characteristic \r\nbehavior is the result of innate qualities transmitted by heredity from one \r\ngeneration to the next ... The Jews, however, are beyond doubt a mixed race, \r\njust as are all other groups of our civilization. Sincere anthropologists are \r\nagreed on this point; assertions to the contrary all belong to the field of \r\npolitical propaganda and must be rated accordingly."\r\n\r\nEinstein was right because geneticists tell us that all human DNA is virtually \r\nidentical. There isn\'t a "Jewish" race or a "Palestinian" race, really. We are \r\nall members of the same species and our differences are \r\nprimarily traditional (i.e., cultural), not racial. Politicians, religious \r\nfigures and demagogues often use cultural differences to convince us to oppose \r\neach other, and even to go to war, but if we examined our bloodlines closely enough, we\'d find that we\'re \r\nall "mongrels" of the same species. So why fight wars over differences \r\nthat are less even than skin deep?\r\n\r\nEinstein was also aware that widespread anti-Semitism on the part of Arabs was \r\nnot a historical fact, and that friction between Jews and Arabs was due \r\nlargely to legitimate fears and grievances on the part of Arabs who faced a \r\nhost of problems due to the migration of large numbers of Jews to Palestine (many of them with the obvious intention of taking over). Einstein said, "There \r\ncould be no greater calamity than a permanent discord between us and the Arab \r\npeople. Despite the great wrong that has been done to us [the Holocaust], we \r\nmust strive for a just and lasting compromise with the Arab people ... Let us \r\nrecall that in former times no people lived in greater friendship with us than \r\nthe ancestors of these Arabs."\r\n\r\nWhat the early Zionists did, in effect, was use European racism against Jews to excuse \r\nJewish racism against Palestinians. This was simply wrong. Historically the Arabs had treated \r\nthe Jews far better than European Christians had. Until Jews began arriving in \r\nlarge numbers with the stated intention of taking over, Jews and Arabs \r\nhad lived together in peace. Why then were Arabs singled \r\nout for oppression and domination by Jews? \r\n\r\nEinstein lamented the failure of the Jews to reach a just understanding with \r\nthe Arabs, and criticized their reliance on their influence with powerful \r\nEnglishmen like Winston Churchill. (Churchill sympathized strongly with Zionism and had much to \r\ndo with the transfer of political power to the Jewish minority in the early \r\n1920\'s.) In a letter to a friend, Einstein said: "I also think that during these \r\nlast years an understanding between us and the Arabs which could have led to a \r\nbi-national administration was no longer possible. Earlier, howeveractually, \r\nsince 1918we neglected the Arabs and trusted in the Englishmen over and over \r\nagain." But to be fair to the Englishmen, they often did muchthough never \r\nallof what the more ardent Zionists demanded, to the anguish of the Palestinian \r\nmajority, who were denied their right to self-determination. It would have \r\nbeen impossible for Englishmen to make one side happy without bitterly \r\ndisappointing the other. But if true democracy had been enacted, the Arab \r\nmajority could have prevented what eventually happened in 1948: the ethnic \r\ncleansing of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian farmers and their families, \r\nmost of whom were not combatants and had every right to return to their \r\nland once the fighting was over. For someone like Einstein, who believed in the \r\nequality of human beings, and for everyone who abhors racism and believes in \r\nequal human rights, a Jewish state in Palestine presents a real dilemma. The \r\nPalestinians are, and have always been, the majority. Only by keeping millions \r\nof Palestinians in refugee camps and in political limbo in Gaza and the West \r\nBank can Israeli Jews claim to constitute the \r\n"majority."\r\n\r\nEinstein denied any superior rights for Jews, calling for "complete equality" for \r\nPalestinian Arabs as the "most important aspect" of Jewish policy: "The most \r\nimportant aspect of our policy must be our ever-present, manifest desire \r\nto institute complete equality for the Arab citizens living in our midst ... The \r\nattitude we adopt toward the Arab minority will provide the real test of our \r\nmoral standards as a people."Only cooperation with Arabs, led by "educated, spiritually \r\nalert" Jewish workers, he wrote, "can create a dignified and safe life. What \r\nsaddens me is less the fact that the Jews are not smart enough to understand \r\nthis, but rather, that they are not just smart enough to want it."\r\n\r\nOn the question of the partitioning of Palestine in order to create a Jewish \r\nstate, he said: "I \r\nshould much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of \r\nliving together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. Apart from \r\npractical consideration, my awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists \r\nthe ideas of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal \r\npower no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will \r\nsustain, especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own \r\nranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a \r\nJewish state. We are no longer the Jews of the Maccabee period. A return to a \r\nnation in the political sense of the word would be equivalent to turning away \r\nfrom the spiritualization of our community which we owe to the genius of our \r\nprophets." \r\n\r\nHe also said, "A just solution of this problem  \r\nand one worthy of both nations is an end no less important and no less worthy of \r\nour efforts than the promotion of the work of construction itself [i.e., than \r\nthe creation of a Jewish homeland in Israel]."\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he said, "... it is for us to solve the problem of living side by \r\nside with our brother the Arab in an open, generous, and worthy manner."\r\n\r\nEinstein obviously believed the first priority of Zionism should be a just agreement \r\nwith the Arabs. He was not alone in this opinion, as other Jewish leaders and \r\nintellectuals, including Freud, Fromm, Buber, Magnes, Hugo Bergmann, Ruppin and \r\nCalvaresci spoke along the same lines. Norman Bentwich said, "That conviction \r\nwas expressed emphatically by Albert Einstein when I visited him in his cottage \r\nduring my stay in Berlin in 1930. He would not remain associated, he said, with \r\nthe Zionist movement unless it tried to make peace with the Arabs in deed as \r\nwell as in word. The Jews should form committees with the Arab peasants and \r\nworkers, and not try to negotiate only with the leaders."\r\n\r\nEinstein did not think the partitioning of Palestine was a good idea, writing to \r\nan unidentified Mr. Brainin in the US: ""[I have a] long-held ... conviction \r\n... that for Palestine the only fair and suitable form of government is a \r\nbi-national arrangement. However, the management would have to be substantially \r\ntaken over by the United Nations for the foreseeable future, because the \r\npolitical life of Palestine is thoroughly muddled and, therefore, the land is \r\nnot ripe for political independence."\r\n\r\nEinstein became more and more disillusioned with the lip service Zionists paid \r\nto justice, while descending into racism and \r\nnationalism, saying, "... [the Zionist] movement [must] avoid the danger of \r\ndegenerating into a blind nationalism. In my opinion, we must endeavor above all \r\nthat psychological understanding and an honorable will towards cooperation take \r\nthe place of resentment towards the Arabs. The overcoming of this difficulty \r\nwill, in my opinion, be the touchstone that our community has a right to \r\nexistence in the higher sense. I must unfortunately openly acknowledge that the \r\nattitude of our [Zionist] officialdom, as well as the majority of public \r\nexpressions in this connection, appear to me to leave much to be desired."\r\n\r\nEinstein also feared the growing military mentality he saw among Jews: "It is quite \r\ntrue that our situation has once again become perilous and that we lack all \r\npower to check the danger. But when I look at Russia and America, I cannot help \r\nwondering whether we would behave more sensibly if we were as powerful as they \r\nare." Today Israel reportedly has the fourth most powerful \r\nmilitary on the planet, despite its tiny area and small population compared \r\nto those of the superpowers America, Russia and China. How did tiny Israel \r\nbecome so incredibly powerful? Because American taxpayers have \r\ncontributed hundreds of billions of dollars in financial aid and advanced \r\nweapons to a nation that increasingly seems to have a police state mentality. \r\nNow that awesome military power is being used to occupy the West Bank and allow robber \r\nbarons to take the ever-dwindling land of Palestinian farm families. \r\n\r\nEinstein also recognized that Zionists were provoking the Arabs to "acts of \r\nhostility" (such tactics have been freely admitted by Israeli military leaders like \r\nMoshe Dayan, who admitted trying to lure Syrians to attack Israelis in border \r\nskirmishes). Einstein said, "We need to pay greater attention to our relations \r\nwith the Arabs. By cultivating these carefully we shall be able in future to \r\nprevent things from becoming so dangerously strained that people can take \r\nadvantage of them to provoke acts of hostility. This goal is perfectly within \r\nour reach, because our work of construction has been, and must continue to be, \r\ncarried out in such a manner as to serve the real interests of the Arab \r\npopulation also."\r\n\r\nEinstein clearly saw a just peace with Arabs as vital, saying, "When appraising \r\nthe achievement, however, let us not lose sight of the cause to be served by \r\nthis achievement: rescue of our endangered brethren, dispersed in many lands, by \r\nuniting them in Israel; creation of a community which conforms as closely as \r\npossible to the ethical ideals of our people as they have been formed in the \r\ncourse of a long history. One of these ideals is peace, based on understanding \r\nand self-restraint, and not on violence. If we are imbued with this ideal, our \r\njoy becomes somewhat mingled with sadness, because our relations with the Arabs \r\nare far from this ideal at the present time. It may well be that we would have \r\nreached this idea, had we been permitted to work out, undisturbed by others, our \r\nrelations with our neighbors, for we want peace and we realize that our future \r\ndevelopment depends on peace." How very different his words sound, than those of \r\nIsraeli leaders like Ariel Sharon and Binyamin Netanyahu! \r\n\r\nAs one of his biographers, Ronald Clark, pointed out, "Along with these feelings \r\nwhich tended to qualify Einstein\'s enthusiasm for Zionism there was the \r\nessentially pacifist nature of his approach to the problems of the world. Even \r\nwhen it came to Zionism, a subject as emotionally close to his heart as anything \r\never was, he could never look on his opponents, in this case Arabs, as the \r\ndeep-eyed villains which the sentiments of the case demanded. He was all for the \r\npolicy of live and let live." \r\n\r\nIn the end, Einstein foresaw the problem of European-style ultra-nationalism leading \r\nto similar woes for the Jews. In his testimony of January 1946 before the \r\nAnglo-American Committee of Inquiry, he said: "The State idea is not according \r\nto my heart. I cannot understand why it is needed. It is connected with \r\nnarrow-mindedness and economic obstacles. I believe that it is bad. I have \r\nalways been against it [i.e., against a Jewish political state rather than a \r\nJewish homeland]." He went further to deride the concept of a Jewish \r\ncommonwealth as an "imitation of Europe, the end of which was brought about by \r\nnationalism."\r\n\r\nOnce the true nature of the fledgling Jewish state became evident, a number of prominent Jewish \r\nvoices of conscience rose to the occasion and sent an Open Letter to The New York \r\nTimes. Einstein, Sidney Hook, Hannah Arendt and Seymour Milman were among the \r\nsigners of this letter, which appeared in the Times \r\non December 4, 1948. \r\n\r\nThe letter said: \r\n\r\nAmong the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is \r\nthe emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the \'Freedom Party\' ... \r\na political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political \r\nphilosophy, and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties. It was formed out \r\nof the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist \r\nright-wing chauvinist organization in Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to \r\nthe United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American \r\nsupport for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political \r\nties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans \r\nof national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is \r\ninconceivable that those who opposed fascism throughout the world, if currently \r\ninformed as to Mr. Begin\'s political record and perspectives, could add their \r\nnames and support to the movement he represents ... A shocking example was \r\ntheir behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin ... this incident \r\nexemplified the character and actions of the Freedom Party. Within the Jewish \r\ncommunity they have preached an admixture of ultra-nationalism, religious \r\nmysticism, and racial superiority. Like other fascist parties, they have been \r\nused to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free \r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by \r\nBegin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine, bear the \r\nimprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a \r\nFascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike) and \r\nmisrepresentation are means, and a \'Leader State\' is the goal.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing consideration, it is imperative \r\nthat the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. \r\nIt is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has \r\nrefused to campaign against Begin\'s efforts, or even to expose to its own \r\nconstituents the dangers to Israel of support to Begin. The undersigned \r\ntherefore take the means publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning \r\nBegin and his party, and of urging all concerned not to support this latest \r\nmanifestation of fascism." [pp. 352-353]\r\n\r\nA scanned image of this Open Letter to The New York Times is available at this\r\n\r\nlink.\r\n\r\nThe Official Einstein Archive contains the draft of an address Einstein prepared \r\nfor a dinner for the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in 1950. Zionists \r\nseem to have \r\ndrafted an earlier version of the text, which contained "eulogistic expressions" \r\nabout Israel. The original draft stated: "The people of America will welcome this \r\ngreat orchestra because it is sent to us in a spirit of gratitude for the part \r\nwe have played in helping to establish a democratic state of Israel. Israel\'s \r\ncontribution to the beauty of living, like all artistic creations, will help not \r\nonly Israel, but the entire Middle East." Einstein crossed out parts of the \r\noriginal draft, including the reference to Israel as "a democratic state," and \r\nstated his consistent view that "The meaning of Israel lay always and still \r\nlies in the spiritual values which it creates and embodies. The new state should \r\nonly be seen as a means to serve these ends efficiently, not as an end in itself \r\nor even as an instrument of political ambitions." The document is dated \r\nalmost two years after the State of Israel was founded. It seems Einstein did \r\nnot consider Israel to be a "democratic state" and did not see the creation of a \r\nJewish state in Palestine being a "help" to the "entire Middle East." Einstein \r\nhad a different dream than the dream of political Zionists. His early support for a \r\nJewish presence in Palestine clearly did not extend to Jews seizing control of \r\nthe region and subduing or displacing Palestinians. While some commentators \r\nseem to see Einstein as either an ardent political Zionist, or a man who \r\nvacillated on the subject of a Jewish state, to me he seems remarkably \r\nconsistent. His dream was always of a form of Judaism that lived up to the \r\nvisions of Hebrew prophets who called for chesed [mercy, \r\ncompassion, lovingkindness] and social justice. As he saw the nature of the Jewish \r\nstate that emerged, he distanced himself from the racism, nationalism and \r\nmilitarism which soon became its watchwords. Einstein turned down the presidency of \r\nIsrael when it was offered to him, and he continued to voice his fears "for the soul of Israel." A few \r\nmonths before his death, he remembered his "great hopes that Israel might be \r\nbetter than other nations," only to conclude that "it is no better."\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew prophets called for compassion and \r\nsocial justice. Einstein considered this message of the prophets to be the \r\nliving, beating heart of Judaism, saying: "The Zionist goal gives us an actual \r\nopportunity to put into practice, through a viable solution of the Jewish-Arab \r\nproblem, those principles of tolerance and justice that we owe primarily to our \r\nprophets. I am convinced that the living transmission of those principles is the \r\nmost important thing in Judaism." He also said: "To be a Jew, after all, means \r\nfirst of all, to acknowledge and follow in practice those fundamentals in \r\nhumaneness laid down in the Bible: fundamentals without which no sound and happy \r\ncommunity of men can exist." \r\n\r\nWas Einstein a prophet himself? Just before he died \r\non April 18, 1955, Einstein signed what became known as The Einstein-Russell \r\nManifesto. In it, the theoretical physicist and the philosopher-mathematician \r\nBertrand Russell went beyond vague moral arguments for pacifism. Instead they \r\nposed political choices: "There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress \r\nin happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we \r\ncannot forget our quarrels? We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember \r\nyour humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new \r\nParadise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death."\r\n\r\nWas Einstein a Zionist? Yes, because he shared \r\nthe dream of a Jewish homeland: a community where Jews would be safe and \r\nlive together in peace. But he was not a political Zionist who demanded a Jewish \r\nstate bristling with weapons. Einstein was an idealist who heeded the call of the Hebrew prophets for \r\ncompassion and justice. Just before he \r\ndied, he sounded like one of those prophets himself, saying that the \r\ndifference between Paradise and Sheol [the grave, destruction, death] is a \r\nmatter of choice, of human desire and will. We can choose to see all men as equals, \r\nrespect their rights as we wish them to respect our own, and live in peace, or we can call ourselves the \r\nChosen Few, trample the rights of others, and go down to Sheol: to death, to \r\ndestruction. The world is, to a large degree, what we choose to make of it. We \r\ncan subdue and tame wild beasts, making the savage wolf man\'s best friend, the \r\nloving and loyal dog ... but what will we do about ourselves? Will we ever use our \r\nhearts and brains simultaneously, to our own best advantage? \r\nMichael R.

difficulties \r\nin Mathematics. \r\nI can assure you mine are still greater!\r\n\r\nImagination\r\n\r\nImagination is everything. \r\nIt is the preview of life\'s coming attractions.\r\n(I am enough of an artist \r\nto draw freely upon my imagination.) \r\nImagination is more important than knowledge. \r\nInformation is not knowledge\r\nand yet knowledge is still limited, \r\nfor knowledge of what is \r\ndoes not open the door directly to what should be.\r\nYes, logic may get you from A to B,\r\nbut Imagination will take you everywhere.\r\nImagination encircles the world.\r\nImagination is everything.\r\n\r\nI am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination,\r\nand to raise new questions, new possibilities, \r\nto regard old \r\nproblems from new angles, \r\nrequires creative imagination and marks real advance \r\nin science.\r\nThus, the true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but \r\nimagination.\r\n(And the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources!)\r\n\r\nHoly Curiosity\r\n\r\nLearn from yesterday, \r\nlive for today, \r\nhope for tomorrow. \r\nThe important thing is never\r\nto stop questioning.\r\nNever lose a holy curiosity.\r\n\r\nScience\r\n\r\nMost people say that it is the intellect \r\nwhich makes a great scientist. \r\nThey are wrong: \r\nit is character.\r\nand the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement \r\nof everyday thinking.\r\n\r\nScience is a wonderful thing if one doesn\'t have to earn one\'s living at it,\r\nalthough the process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a \r\ncontinual flight from wonder.\r\nStill, look deep into nature, and then you will understand \r\neverything better.\r\n\r\nNationalism\r\n\r\nNationalism is the infantile sickness\r\nof mankind, \r\nthe measles of the human race,\r\nand so never do anything against your conscience \r\neven if the state demands it.\r\n\r\nNew Math (II)\r\n\r\nNot everything that can be counted \r\ncounts, \r\nand not everything that counts \r\ncan be counted.\r\n\r\nMastery\r\n\r\nOnly one who devotes himself \r\nto a cause \r\nwith his whole strength and soul \r\ncan be a true master. \r\nFor this reason mastery \r\ndemands all of a person.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nIt is a miracle that curiosity \r\nsurvives formal education\r\nand yet it is the supreme art \r\nof the teacher to awaken joy \r\nin creative expression \r\nand knowledge.\r\nStill, it sometimes seems\r\nthat education is what remains \r\nafter one has forgotten \r\neverything he learned in school.\r\n\r\nPoetic Logic\r\n\r\nPolitics is for the present, \r\nbut an equation is for eternity.\r\nPure mathematics is, in its way, \r\nthe poetry of logical ideas.\r\n\r\nReality and Illusion\r\n\r\nReality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent \r\none.\r\nThe distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly \r\npersistent illusion\r\nand the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent \r\nfor absorbing positive knowledge.\r\nThe eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility\r\nand the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that \r\nit is comprehensible.\r\n\r\nFalse Idols\r\n\r\nLet every man be respected \r\nbut no man idolized.\r\n\r\nNew Math (III)\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax\r\n(everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler)\r\nand anyway, I don\'t believe in mathematics\r\nbecause as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they \r\nare not certain,\r\nwhile as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\r\nSo please don\'t worry about your difficulties in Mathematics: I can assure you \r\nthat mine are still greater!\r\n(And please keep in mind that the difference between stupidity and genius is \r\nthat genius has its limits\r\nand that anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new).\r\n\r\nSuffering \r\n\r\nThe devil has put a penalty \r\non all things we enjoy in life. \r\nEither we suffer in health \r\nor we suffer in soul \r\nor we get fat.\r\n\r\nScience and Religion\r\n\r\nScience without religion is lame;\r\nreligion without science is blind.\r\nNever lose a holy curiosity.\r\nIt was the experience of mystery\r\neven if mixed with fear \r\nthat engendered religion.\r\n\r\nFickle Fame\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my theory of relativity is proven correct, \r\nGermany \r\nwill claim me as a German \r\nand France will declare that \r\nI am a citizen of the \r\nworld. \r\n\r\nShould my theory prove untrue, \r\nFrance will say that I am a German \r\nand \r\nGermany will declare that I am a Jew.\r\n\r\n(And if I could only remember the names of all these particles I\'d be a \r\nbotanist!)\r\n\r\nLife\r\n\r\nI never think of the future (it comes soon enough!)\r\nand the tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he \r\nlives.\r\nThe life of the individual has meaning only insofar \r\nas \r\nit aids in making the life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. \r\nLife \r\nis sacred, that is to say, it is the supreme value, \r\nto which all other values are subordinate\r\nand human beings can attain a worthy and harmonious life \r\nonly if they are able to rid themselves, within the limits of human nature, \r\nof \r\nthe striving for the wish fulfillment of material kinds. \r\nThe goal is to raise \r\nthe spiritual values of society.\r\n\r\nA human being is a part of a whole, called by us \r\n"universe," \r\na part limited in time and space. \r\nHe experiences himself, his \r\nthoughts and feelings \r\nas something separated from the rest ... \r\na kind of optical \r\ndelusion of his consciousness. \r\nThis delusion is a kind of prison for us, \r\n\r\nrestricting us to our personal desires \r\nand to affection for a few persons \r\nnearest to us. \r\nOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison \r\nby widening \r\nour circle of compassion \r\nto embrace all living creatures \r\nand the whole of nature \r\nin its beauty.\r\n\r\nSo let every man be respected \r\n\r\nbut no man idolized.\r\n\r\nI believe that a simple\r\nand unassuming\r\nmanner of life\r\nis best for everyone\r\nbest both for the body\r\nand the mind.\r\n\r\nDeterminism\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything is determined by forces over which we have no \r\ncontrol. \r\nIt is determined for the insect as well as for the star. \r\nHuman beings, \r\nvegetables, or cosmic dustwe all dance to a mysterious tune, \r\nintoned \r\nfrom a distance by an invisible piper.\r\nI assert that the cosmic religious experience \r\nis the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific research\r\nand my religion consists of a humble admiration of the \r\nillimitable superior spirit \r\nwho reveals himself in the slight details we are \r\nable to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.\r\nScience without religion is lame; religion without science is blind\r\nand whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth \r\nand Knowledge \r\nis shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.\r\n\r\nBefore God\r\n\r\nI want to know God\'s thoughts; \r\nthe rest are details.\r\nGod does not play dice with the universe.\r\nGod is subtle, but not malicious;\r\nclever, but not dishonest.\r\nGod does not care about our mathematical difficulties. \r\n\r\nHe integrates empirically.\r\n\r\nBefore God \r\nwe are all equally wise\r\nand equally foolish.\r\nThat deep emotional conviction \r\nof the presence \r\nof a superior reasoning power, \r\nwhich is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, \r\nforms my idea of God.\r\nBut I cannot imagine a God \r\nwho rewards and punishes \r\nthe objects of his creation \r\nand is thus but a reflection \r\nof human frailty.\r\nMorality is of the highest importance\r\nbut for us, not God!\r\n\r\nImmortality\r\n\r\nDo I believe in immortality? \r\nNo, and one life is more than enough for me!\r\n\r\nRelated Pages: \r\nMarilyn Monroe Poems,\r\nMuhammad Ali Poems,\r\nAlbert Einstein Poems\r\nAbraham Lincoln Poems,\r\nMark Twain Poems,\r\nNelson Mandela Poems, \r\nPope Francis
