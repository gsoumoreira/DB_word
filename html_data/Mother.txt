H. Lawrence, Gwendolyn Brooks, Walt Whitman, \r\nLucille Clifton, Honore de Balzac, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, \r\nBruce Springsteen and Kanye West.\r\n\r\nThese are my personal top ten poems about mothers: Piano by D. H. Lawrence, Mother to Son by Langston \r\nHughes, To My Mother by Christina Rossetti, Mother \r\no\' Mine by Rudyard Kipling, The Negro Mother by Langston Hughes, Sonnet to \r\nMy Mother by George Barker, To My Mother by Edgar Allen Poe, To My Mother \r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson, The Mother by Gwendolyn Brooks, and In Memory of \r\nMy Mother by Patrick Kavanagh.\r\n\r\ncompiled by  Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nBefore I give a brief history of Mother\'s Day, I \r\nwould like to dedicate the poem below, which is free to copy and use for \r\nnoncommercial purposes, to the two best mothers I know personally ...\r\n\r\nMothers Smile\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nfor my mother, Christine Ena Burch, and my wife, Elizabeth Harris Burch\r\n\r\nThere never was a fonder smile\r\nthan mothers smile, no softer touch\r\nthan mothers touch. So sleep awhile\r\nand know she loves you more than much.\r\n\r\nSo more than much, much more than all.\r\nThough tender words, these do not speak\r\nof love at all, nor how we fall\r\nand mothers there, nor how we reach\r\nfrom nightmares in the ticking night\r\nand she is there to hold us tight.\r\n\r\nThere never was a stronger back\r\nthan fathers back, that held our weight\r\nand lifted us, when we were small,\r\nand bore us till we reached the gate,\r\nthen held our hands that first bright mile\r\ntill we could run, and did, and flew.\r\nBut, oh, a mothers tender smile\r\nwill leap and follow after you!\r\n\r\nMother\'s Daycelebrates and honors mothers and motherhood, maternal bonds, and \r\nthe influence of mothers in human society. The modern celebrations occur throughout \r\nthe world, recalling ancient festivals in honor of Isis, Cybele, Gaia, Artemis, \r\nVenus, Ceres, Danu and other \r\nmother goddesses. Those goddesses may be based on an older, more universal Terra \r\nMater (Earth Mother), as seen in stone carvings that date back to at least 24,000 \r\nBC. However, the modern holidays are based on an American invention not \r\ndirectly descended from the more ancient celebrations.\r\n\r\nOur modern Mother\'s Day celebration probably begins with Julia Ward Howe, an American \r\npoet who was inspired to write the stirring lines of The Battle Hymn of the \r\nRepublic after meeting Abraham Lincoln in November 1861. Howe wrote her\r\nlyrics to the melody of the song John Brown\'s Body, a tribute to the best-known martyr \r\nof the abolitionist movement. Howe\'s lyrics were published by the Atlantic \r\nMonthlyin February 1862 and The Battle Hymn of the Republic quickly became \r\none of the most popular songs of the Civil War era, at least in the Union camps. \r\nIt remains a favorite song \r\nof civil rights workers around the world. \r\n\r\nHowe was dismayed by the massive suffering and destruction caused by the \r\nCivil War, so in 1870 she wrote a "Mother\'s Day Proclamation" which called for a Mother\'s Day for Peace \r\nand asked women around the world to join the cause \r\nof world peace. But Mother\'s Day did not become an official American holiday \r\nuntil the efforts of Anna Jarvis paid off in 1914. Jarvis never mentioned Howe \r\nand their ideas may have developed independently. But in any case, I like the idea of world \r\npeace movement inspired by the love and compassion of good mothers, so the poems \r\nI have chosen for this page honor the best attributes of the \r\nbest mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I am, \r\nor can be, \r\nI owe to my angel mother.\r\n\x97Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo My Mother\r\nby Christina Rossetti \r\n\r\nToday\'s your natal day;\r\nSweet flowers I bring:\r\nMother, accept, I pray\r\nMy offering.\r\n\r\nAnd may you happy live,\r\nAnd long us bless;\r\nReceiving as you give\r\nGreat happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA man may work from sun to sun, \r\nbut a mother\x92s work is never done.\r\n\x97Unknown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMother o\' Mine \r\nby Rudyard Kipling\r\n\r\nIf I were hanged on the highest hill, \r\nMother o\' mine, O mother o\' mine!\r\nI know whose love would follow me still, \r\nMother o\' mine, O mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\nIf I were drowned in the deepest sea, \r\nMother o\' mine, O mother o\' mine!\r\nI know whose tears would come down to me, \r\nMother o\' mine, O mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\nIf I were damned of body and soul, \r\nI know whose prayers would make me whole, \r\nMother o\' mine, O mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are a mother, \r\nyou are never really alone in your thoughts. \r\nA mother always has to think twice, \r\nonce for herself and once for her child.\r\n\x97Sophia Loren\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMother to Son\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nWell, son, I\x92ll tell you:\r\nLife for me ain\x92t been no crystal stair.\r\nIt\x92s had tacks in it,\r\nAnd splinters,\r\nAnd boards torn up,\r\nAnd places with no carpet on the floor\x97\r\nBare.\r\nBut all the time\r\nI\x92se been a-climbin\x92 on,\r\nAnd reachin\x92 landin\x92s,\r\nAnd turnin\x92 corners,\r\nAnd sometimes goin\x92 in the dark\r\nWhere there ain\x92t been no light.\r\nSo boy, don\x92t you turn back.\r\nDon\x92t you set down on the steps\r\n\x92Cause you finds it\x92s kinder hard.\r\nDon\x92t you fall now\x97\r\nFor I\x92se still goin\x92, honey,\r\nI\x92se still climbin\x92,\r\nAnd life for me ain\x92t been no crystal stair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ounce of mother \r\nis worth a ton of priest.\r\n\x97Spanish Proverb\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet to My Mother\r\nby George Barker\r\n\r\nMost near, most dear, most loved, and most far,\r\nUnder the huge window where I often found her\r\nSitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,\r\nGin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,\r\nIrresistible as Rabelais but most tender for\r\nThe lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her,\x97\r\nShe is a procession no one can follow after\r\nBut be like a little dog following a brass band.\r\nShe will not glance up at the bomber or condescend\r\nTo drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,\r\nBut lean on the mahogany table like a mountain\r\nWhom only faith can move, and so I send\r\nO all her faith and all my love to tell her\r\nThat she will move from mourning into morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of a mother is a deep abyss \r\nat the bottom of which you will always find \r\nforgiveness.\r\n\x97Honore de Balzac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Mother\r\nby Anne Taylor\r\nWho fed me from her gentle breast\r\nAnd hushed me in her arms to rest,\r\nAnd on my cheek sweet kisses prest?\r\n \r\nMy Mother!\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly One Mother\r\nby George Cooper\r\n\r\nHundreds of stars in the pretty sky,\r\nHundreds of shells on the shore together,\r\nHundreds of birds that go singing by,\r\nHundreds of lambs in the sunny weather.\r\n\r\nHundreds of dewdrops to greet the dawn,\r\nHundreds of bees in the purple clover,\r\nHundreds of butterflies on the lawn,\r\nBut only one mother the wide world over.\r\n\r\n\r\nSonnet for My Mother\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nSonnets are full of love, and this my tome\r\nHas many sonnets: so here now shall be\r\nOne sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me\r\nTo her whose heart is my heart\'s quiet home,\r\nTo my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee\r\nI learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;\r\nWhose service is my special dignity,\r\nAnd she my loadstar while I go and come\r\nAnd so because you love me, and because\r\nI love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath\r\nOf rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name:\r\nIn you not fourscore years can dim the flame\r\nOf love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws\r\nOf time and change and mortal life and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo My Mother\r\nby Edgar Allen Poe\r\nBecause I feel that, in the Heavens above,\r\nThe angels, whispering to one another,\r\nCan find, among their burning terms of love,\r\nNone so devotional as that of Mother,\r\nTherefore by that dear name I long have called you\x97\r\nYou who are more than mother unto me,\r\nAnd fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you\r\nIn setting my Virginia\'s spirit free.\r\nMy mother\x97my own mother, who died early,\r\nWas but the mother of myself; but you\r\nAre mother to the one I loved so dearly,\r\nAnd thus are dearer than the mother I knew\r\nBy that infinity with which my wife\r\nWas dearer to my soul than its soul-life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo My Mother \r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\nYou too, my mother, read my rhymes\r\nFor love of unforgotten times,\r\nAnd you may chance to hear once more\r\nThe little feet along the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Negro Mother\r\nby Langston Hughes\r\n\r\nChildren, I come back today\r\nTo tell you a story of the long dark way\r\nThat I had to climb, that I had to know\r\nIn order that the race might live and grow.\r\nLook at my face - dark as the night -\r\nYet shining like the sun with love\'s true light.\r\nI am the dark girl who crossed the red sea\r\nCarrying in my body the seed of the free.\r\nI am the woman who worked in the field\r\nBringing the cotton and the corn to yield.\r\nI am the one who labored as a slave,\r\nBeaten and mistreated for the work that I gave -\r\nChildren sold away from me, I\'m husband sold, too.\r\nNo safety, no love, no respect was I due.\r\n\r\nThree hundred years in the deepest South:\r\nBut God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.\r\nGod put a dream like steel in my soul.\r\nNow, through my children, I\'m reaching the goal.\r\n\r\nNow, through my children, young and free,\r\nI realized the blessing deed to me.\r\nI couldn\'t read then. I couldn\'t write.\r\nI had nothing, back there in the night.\r\nSometimes, the valley was filled with tears,\r\nBut I kept trudging on through the lonely years.\r\nSometimes, the road was hot with the sun,\r\nBut I had to keep on till my work was done:\r\nI had to keep on! No stopping for me -\r\nI was the seed of the coming Free.\r\nI nourished the dream that nothing could smother\r\nDeep in my breast - the Negro mother.\r\nI had only hope then, but now through you,\r\nDark ones of today, my dreams must come true:\r\nAll you dark children in the world out there,\r\nRemember my sweat, my pain, my despair.\r\nRemember my years, heavy with sorrow -\r\nAnd make of those years a torch for tomorrow.\r\nMake of my pass a road to the light\r\nOut of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.\r\nLift high my banner out of the dust.\r\nStand like free men supporting my trust.\r\nBelieve in the right, let none push you back.\r\nRemember the whip and the slaver\'s track.\r\nRemember how the strong in struggle and strife\r\nStill bar you the way, and deny you life -\r\nBut march ever forward, breaking down bars.\r\nLook ever upward at the sun and the stars.\r\nOh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers\r\nImpel you forever up the great stairs -\r\nFor I will be with you till no white brother\r\nDares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must never forget that mothers are also sweethearts and lovers ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome Slowly, Eden\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nCome slowly, Eden\r\nLips unused to thee.\r\nBashful, sip thy jasmines,\r\nAs the fainting bee,\r\nReaching late his flower,\r\nRound her chamber hums,\r\nCounts his nectarsalights,\r\nAnd is lost in balms!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermits carnal ecstasy.\r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me, only, with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\'ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine:\r\nBut might I of Jove\'s nectar sup,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope, that there\r\nIt could not withered be.\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\'st back to me:\r\nSince when it grows, and smells, I swear,\r\nNot of itself, but thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe Walks In Beauty\r\nby Lord Bryon\r\n\r\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\r\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\r\nAnd all that\'s best of dark and bright\r\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes:\r\nThus mellow\'d to that tender light\r\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\r\n\r\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\r\nHad half impair\'d the nameless grace\r\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\r\nOr softly lightens o\'er her face;\r\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express\r\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nAnd on that cheek, and o\'er that brow,\r\nSo soft, so calm, yet eloquent,\r\nThe smiles that win, the tints that glow,\r\nBut tell of days in goodness spent,\r\nA mind at peace with all below,\r\nA heart whose love is innocent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting at Night\r\nby Robert Browning\r\n\r\nThe grey sea and the long black land;\r\nAnd the yellow half-moon large and low;\r\nAnd the startled little waves that leap\r\nIn fiery ringlets from their sleep,\r\nAs I gain the cove with pushing prow,\r\nAnd quench its speed i\' the slushy sand.\r\n\r\nThen a mile of warm sea-scented beach;\r\nThree fields to cross till a farm appears;\r\nA tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch\r\nAnd blue spurt of a lighted match,\r\nAnd a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,\r\nThan the two hearts beating each to each!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silken Tent\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nShe is as in a field a silken tent\r\nAt midday when the sunny summer breeze\r\nHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,\r\nSo that in guys it gently sways at ease,\r\nAnd its supporting central cedar pole,\r\nThat is its pinnacle to heavenward\r\nAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,\r\nSeems to owe naught to any single cord,\r\nBut strictly held by none, is loosely bound\r\nBy countless silken ties of love and thought\r\nTo everything on earth the compass round,\r\nAnd only by one\'s going slightly taut\r\nIn the capriciousness of summer air\r\nIs of the slightest bondage made aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nShall I Compare Thee to a Summer\'s Day?\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nShall I compare thee to a summer\'s day?\r\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\r\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\r\nAnd summer\'s lease hath all too short a date.\r\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\r\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\r\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\r\nBy chance, or nature\'s changing course untrimmed.\r\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\r\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\'st;\r\nNor shall death brag thou wand\'rest in his shade,\r\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\'st,\r\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\r\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Knew A Woman\r\nby Theodore Roethke\r\n\r\nI knew a woman, lovely in her bones,\r\nWhen small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;\r\nAh, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:\r\nThe shapes a bright container can contain!\r\nOf her choice virtues only gods should speak,\r\nOr English poets who grew up on Greek\r\n(I\'d have them sing in chorus, cheek to cheek.)\r\n\r\nHow well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,\r\nShe taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and stand;\r\nShe taught me Touch, that undulant white skin:\r\nI nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;\r\nShe was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,\r\nComing behind her for her pretty sake\r\n(But what prodigious mowing did we make.)\r\n\r\nLove likes a gander, and adores a goose:\r\nHer full lips pursed, the errant note to seize;\r\nShe played it quick, she played it light and loose;\r\nMy eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;\r\nHer several parts could keep a pure repose,\r\nOr one hip quiver with a mobile nose\r\n(She moved in circles, and those circles moved.)\r\n\r\nLet seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:\r\nI\'m martyr to a motion not my own;\r\nWhat\'s freedom for? To know eternity.\r\nI swear she cast a shadow white as stone.\r\nBut who would count eternity in days?\r\nThese old bones live to learn her wanton ways:\r\n(I measure time by how a body sways.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd mothers are formidable women in their own right ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not All\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nLove is not all: It is not meat nor drink\r\nNor slumber nor a roof against the rain,\r\nNor yet a floating spar to men that sink\r\nand rise and sink and rise and sink again.\r\nLove cannot fill the thickened lung with breath\r\nNor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;\r\nYet many a man is making friends with death\r\neven as I speak, for lack of love alone.\r\nIt well may be that in a difficult hour,\r\npinned down by need and moaning for release\r\nor nagged by want past resolution\'s power,\r\nI might be driven to sell your love for peace,\r\nOr trade the memory of this night for food.\r\nIt may well be. I do not think I would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice to a Girl\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed;\r\nLay that on your heart,\r\nMy young angry dear;\r\nThis truth, this hard and precious stone,\r\nLay it on your hot cheek,\r\nLet it hide your tear.\r\nHold it like a crystal\r\nWhen you are alone\r\nAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.\r\nLong, look long and you will be blessed:\r\nNo one worth possessing\r\nCan be quite possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solitary\r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\nMy heart has grown rich with the passing of years,\r\n I have less need now than when I was young\r\nTo share myself with every comer\r\n Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.\r\nIt is one to me that they come or go\r\n If I have myself and the drive of my will,\r\nAnd strength to climb on a summer night\r\n And watch the stars swarm over the hill.\r\nLet them think I love them more than I do,\r\n Let them think I care, though I go alone;\r\nIf it lifts their pride, what is it to me\r\n Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMothers are also mortal women, subject to time and death ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory of My Mother\r\nby Eunice de Chazeau\r\n\r\nShe saw him, knew, and waited for a year\r\nthat he should ask; then gave her perishable body\r\nwithout vanity. Leaving the rectangular\r\ntown and reassurance of deep sod, she\r\nfollowed him where crag and glacier\r\nstab the sun, and rivers plunging flay\r\ntheir stones.She lay beside him on sand, her\r\ndreams unsheltered from the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nHad she known how quickly days would spill\r\ntheir splendor, only dregs of time be left\r\nhad she known how at last, and by his will,\r\nher ashes and bones would be strewn to drift\r\nwith his in troughs of ocean, nevertheless,\r\neyes wide with fear, she would have answered yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\nBrought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\nHer face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMothers live on through the children they love so dearly ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCradle Song\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther notable poems and songs about mothers ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Madonna by the Beatles\r\nLet It Be by the Beatles (written by Paul McCartney \r\nafter a dream in which his departed mother told him to Let it be)\r\nJulia by the Beatles (written by John Lennon for his \r\nmother Julia, who passed away in 1958)\r\nThe Chimney Sweeper (When my mother died I was very \r\nyoung) by William Blake \r\nThe Angel that Presided O\'er My Birth by William Blake\r\nA Bronzeville Mother Loiters in Mississippi by \r\nGwendolyn Brooks\r\nMother and Poet by Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\nAh, Woe Is Me, My Mother Dear by Robert Burns\r\nMy Mama Moved Among the Days by Lucille Clifton\r\nChild and Mother by Eugene Field\r\nMama Tried by Merle Haggard\r\nThe Mother Mourns by Thomas Hardy\r\nTo Una by Robinson Jeffers\r\nFawn\'s Foster Mother by Robinson Jeffers\r\nRosalinda\x92s Eyes by Billy Joel (written for his mother \r\nRosalinda)\r\nMother I Cannot Mind My Wheel by Sappho as translated \r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\nGirls Just Want to Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper\r\nI Ask My Mother to Sing byLi-Young Lee \r\nMy Mother by Claude McKay\r\nThe Courage that My Mother Had by Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\nThe Sad Mother by Gabriela Mistral\r\nMama I\'m Coming Home by Ozzy Osbourne\r\nPrayer for a New Mother by Dorothy Parker\r\nMedusa by Sylvia Plath\r\nAve Maria by Sir Walter Scott\r\nMother and Child Reunion by Paul Simon\r\nMother Among the Dustbins by Stevie Smith\r\nThe Wish by Bruce Springsteen\r\nThe Best Day by Taylor Swift\r\nThe Mother of a Poet by Sara Teasdale\r\nTo Mother by Marina Tsvetaeva \r\nMama\'s Song by Carrie Underwood\r\nHey Mama by Kanye West\r\nMother and Babe by Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
