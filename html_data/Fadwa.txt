The sister of \r\nthe poet Ibrahim Tuqan, she was born in Nablus in 1917. She began writing in traditional forms, but \r\nlater became \r\na pioneer of Arabic free verse. Her work often deals with feminine \r\nexplorations of love and social protest. After the Nakba (Catastrophe) of 1948 \r\nshe began to write about Israel\'s occupation of \r\nPalestinian territories. Then, after the Six Day War of 1967, she also began writing \r\npatriotic poems. Her autobiography Difficult JourneyMountainous Journey \r\nwas translated into English in 1990. Tuqan received the International Poetry \r\nAward, the Jerusalem \r\nAward for Culture and Arts and the United Arab Emirates Award, the latter two both \r\nin 1990. She also received the Honorary Palestine prize for poetry in 1996. She \r\nwas the subject of a documentary film directed by novelist Liana Bader in 1999. \r\nTuqan died on December 12, 2003 during the height of the Al-Aqsa \r\nIntifada, while her hometown of Nablus was under siege. Her poem Wahsha: \r\nMoustalhama min Qanoon al Jathibiya (Longing: Inspired by the Law of \r\nGravity) was one of the last poems she penned, while largely bedridden.\r\nTuqan is widely considered to be a symbol of the Palestinian \r\ncause and is "one of the most distinguished figures of modern Arabic literature.\r\nIn his obituary for The Guardian, Lawrence Joffe wrote: "The Palestinian poet \r\nFadwa Tuqan, who has died aged 86, forcefully expressed a nation\'s sense of loss \r\nand defiance. Moshe Dayan, the Israeli general, likened reading one of Tuqan\'s \r\npoems to facing 20 enemy commandos. In her poem Martyrs Of The Intifada, Tuqan wrote of \r\nyoung stone-throwers:\r\n\r\nThey died standing, blazing on the road\r\nShining like stars, their lips pressed to the lips of life\r\nThey stood up in the face of death\r\nThen disappeared like the sun.\r\n\r\nYet the true power of her words derived not from warlike imagery, but from their \r\naffirmation of Palestinian identity and the dream of return.\r\n\r\nThis page contains modern English translations of the poems of Fadwa Tuqan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough for Me\r\nby Fadwa Tuqan\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEnough for me to lie in the earth,\r\nto be buried in her,\r\nto sink meltingly into her fecund soil, to vanish ...\r\nonly to spring forth like a flower\r\nbrightening the play of my countrymen\'s children.\r\n\r\nEnough for me to remain\r\nin my native soil\'s embrace,\r\nto be as close as a handful of dirt,\r\na sprig of grass,\r\na wildflower. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExistence\r\nby Fadwa Tuqan\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn my solitary life, I was a lost question;\r\nin the encompassing darkness,\r\nmy answer lay concealed.\r\n\r\nYou were a bright new star\r\nrevealed by fate,\r\nradiating light from the fathomless darkness.\r\n\r\nThe other stars rotated around you\r\nonce, twice \r\nuntil I perceived\r\nyour unique radiance.\r\n\r\nThen the bleak blackness broke\r\nand in the twin tremors\r\nof our entwined hands\r\nI had found my missing answer.\r\n\r\nOh you! Oh you intimate, yet distant!\r\nDon\'t you remember the coalescence \r\nOf our spirits in the flames?\r\nOf my universe with yours?\r\nOf the two poets?\r\nDespite our great distance,\r\nExistence unites us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Remains\r\nby Fadwa Tuqan\r\nloose translation/interpretation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nTonight, were together,\r\nbut tomorrow you\'ll be hidden from me again,\r\nthanks to lifes cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe seas will separate us ...\r\nOh!Oh!If I could only see you! \r\nBut I\'ll never know ...\r\nwhere your steps led you, \r\nwhich routes you took, \r\nor to what unknown destinations\r\nyour feet were compelled.\r\n\r\nYou will depart and the thief of hearts,\r\nthe denier of beauty,\r\nwill rob us of all that\'s dear to us,\r\nwill steal our happiness,\r\nleaving our hands empty.\r\n\r\nTomorrow at dawn you\'ll vanish like a phantom,\r\ndissipating into a delicate mist\r\ndissolving quickly in the summer sun.\r\n\r\nYour scentyour scent!contains the essence of life,\r\nfilling my heart\r\nas the earth absorbs the lifegiving rain.\r\n\r\nI will miss you like the fragrance of trees\r\nwhen you leave tomorrow,\r\nand nothing remains.\r\n\r\nJust as everything beautiful and all that\'s dear to us\r\nis lostlost!when nothing remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deluge and the Tree\r\n\r\nWhen the hurricane swirled and spread its deluge\r\nof dark evil\r\nonto the good green land\r\n\'they\' gloated.

Not with our red streams flowing forever,\r\nnot while the wine of our thorn limbs\r\nfed the thirsty roots,\r\nArab roots alive\r\ntunneling deep, deep, into the land!\r\n\r\nWhen the Tree rises up, the branches\r\nshall flourish green and fresh in the sun,\r\nthe laughter of the Tree shall leaf\r\nbeneath the sun\r\nand birds shall return.\r\nUndoubtedly, the birds shall return.\r\nThe birds shall return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor Pains\r\n\r\nThe wind blows the pollen in the night\r\nthrough ruins of fields and homes.\r\nEarth shivers with love,\r\nwith the pain of giving birth,\r\nbut the conqueror wants us to believe\r\nstories of submission and surrender.\r\n\r\nO Arab Aurora!\r\nTell the usurper of our land\r\nthat childbirth is a force unknown to him,\r\nthe pain of a mothers body,\r\nthat the scarred land\r\ninaugurates life\r\nat the moment of dawn\r\nwhen the rose of blood\r\nblooms on the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLonging: Inspired by the Law of Gravity\r\n\r\ntranslated from the original Arabic by Chris Millis and Tania Tamari Nasir\r\n\r\n\r\nTime\'s out and I\'m home alone with the shadow I cast\r\nGone is the law of the universe, scattered by frivolous fate\r\nNothing to hold down my things\r\nNothing to weigh them to the floor\r\nMy possessions have flown, they belong to others\r\nMy chair, my cupboard, the revolving stool\r\n\r\nAlone with the shadow I cast\r\nNo father, no mother\r\nNo brothers, no sisters to swell\r\nThe house full with laughter\r\nNothing but loneliness and grief\r\nAnd the rubble of months, the years\r\nBend my back, slow my steps, blind me to the horizon\r\n\r\nI miss the smell of coffee, the scent in the air\r\nIts absence an ecstasy where I drown morning and night\r\n\r\nTime\'s out and I\'m home alone\r\nWith the shadow I cast\r\n\r\nI miss the company of books\r\nTheir consolation through trouble and joy\r\n\r\nI miss, how I miss my mother\'s ancient clock, family photos framed on the wall\r\nI miss my oud\r\nFor all its silent, severed strings\r\n\r\nTime\'s out and I\'m home alone\r\nThe curfew hurts\r\nIt hurts me, no it kills me, the killing of children near my home\r\n\r\nI\'m afraid of tomorrow\r\nI\'m afraid of the unknowable resources of fate\r\nO God, don\'t let me be a burden, shunned by young and old\r\nI wait to arrive where the land is silent, I\'m waiting for death\r\nLong has been my journey O God\r\nMake the path short and the journey end\r\n\r\nFirst published as Wahsha: Moustalhama min Qanoon al \r\nJathibiya in Al Karmel 72-73, 2002 by arrangement with the estate of Fadwa \r\nTouqan.

And I felt defeated.\r\nBut Hamza-the-ordinary said:\r\nMy sister, our land has a throbbing heart,\r\nit doesnt cease to beat, and it endures\r\nthe unendurable. It keeps the secrets\r\nof hills and wombs. This land sprouting\r\nwith spikes and palms is also the land\r\nthat gives birth to a freedom-fighter.\r\nThis land, my sister, is a woman.\r\n\r\nDays rolled by. I saw Hamza nowhere.\r\nYet I felt the belly of the land\r\nwas heaving in pain.\r\n\r\nHamza  sixty-five  weighs\r\nheavy like a rock on his own back.\r\nBurn, burn his house,\r\na command screamed,\r\nand tie his son in a cell.\r\nThe military ruler of our town later explained:\r\nit was necessary for law and order,\r\nthat is, for love and peace!\r\n\r\nArmed soldiers gherraoed his house:\r\nthe serpents coil came full circle.\r\nThe bang at the door was but an order \r\nevacuate, damn it!\r\nAnd generous as they were with time, they could say:\r\nin an hour, yes!\r\n\r\nHamza opened the window.\r\nFace to face with the sun blazing outside,\r\nhe cried: in this house my children\r\nand I will live and die\r\nfor Palestine.\r\nHamzas voice echoed clean\r\nacross the bleeding silence of the town.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, impeccably,\r\nthe house came crumbling down,\r\nthe rooms were blown to pieces in the sky,\r\nand the bricks and the stones all burst forth,\r\nburying dreams and memories of a lifetime\r\n\r\nof labor, tears, and some happy moments.\r\n\r\nYesterday I saw Hamza\r\nwalking down a street in our town \r\nHamza the ordinary man as he always was:\r\nalways secure in his determination.\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
