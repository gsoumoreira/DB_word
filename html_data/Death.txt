Poems of particular interest \r\ninclude the lovely and \r\ntouching Requiescat by Oscar Wilde; a \r\ntranslation of a fragment by the \r\nfirst great lyric poet, Sappho of Lesbos, and masterpieces of the genre by Conrad Aiken, \r\nW.

Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous Ballad, circa 960 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIt is to the others as if someone robbed them of a gift.\r\nThey will kill him if he comes in force.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf is on one island; I, on another.\r\nThat island is fast, surrounded by fens.\r\nThere are fierce men on this island.\r\nThey will kill him if he comes in force.\r\nIt is otherwise with us.\r\n\r\nWulf\'s far wanderings, I suffered with hope.\r\nWhenever it rained and I woke, disconsolate,\r\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\r\nFor me, that was pleasant, but it also was painful.\r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, unable to eat.\r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A she-wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sunder what never was one:\r\nour song together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLost\r\n\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLost on a fogbound spit of sand\r\nin shoes that pinch me, close at hand\r\nI hear the splash of Charon\'s oar\r\nthat ferries no one to a happy shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuneral Blues\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\r\nPrevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\r\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum\r\nBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\r\n\r\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\r\nScribbling on the sky the message He is Dead.\r\nPut crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\r\nLet the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\r\n\r\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West,\r\nMy working week and my Sunday rest,\r\nMy noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\r\nI thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\r\nPack up the moon and dismantle the sun,\r\nPour away the ocean and sweep up the woods;\r\nFor nothing now can ever come to any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Rose of Summer \r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nTis the last rose of summer \r\nLeft blooming alone; \r\nAll her lovely companions \r\nAre faded and gone; \r\nNo flower of her kindred, \r\nNo rosebud is nigh, \r\nTo reflect back her blushes, \r\nTo give sigh for sigh.\r\n\r\nIll not leave thee, thou lone one! \r\nTo pine on the stem; \r\nSince the lovely are sleeping, \r\nGo, sleep thou with them. \r\nThus kindly I scatter \r\nThy leaves oer the bed, \r\nWhere thy mates of the garden \r\nLie scentless and dead.\r\n\r\nSo soon may I follow, \r\nWhen friendships decay, \r\nAnd from Loves shining circle \r\nThe gems drop away. \r\nWhen true hearts lie withered \r\nAnd fond ones are flown, \r\nOh! who would inhabit \r\nThis bleak world alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nTo what purpose, April, do you return again?\r\nBeauty is not enough.\r\nYou can no longer quiet me with the redness\r\nOf little leaves opening stickily.\r\nI know what I know.\r\nThe sun is hot on my neck as I observe\r\nThe spikes of the crocus.\r\nThe smell of the earth is good.\r\nIt is apparent that there is no death.\r\nBut what does that signify?\r\nNot only under ground are the brains of men \r\n\r\nEaten by maggots.\r\nLife in itself\r\nIs nothing,\r\nAn empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.\r\nIt is not enough that yearly, down this hill,\r\nApril\r\nComes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Is Lost\r\nby Noel Coward\r\n\r\nDeep in our sub-conscious, we are told\r\nLie all our memories, lie all the notes\r\nOf all the music we have ever heard\r\nAnd all the phrases those we loved have spoken,\r\nSorrows and losses time has since consoled,\r\nFamily jokes, out-moded anecdotes\r\nEach sentimental souvenir and token\r\nEverything seen, experienced, each word\r\nAddressed to us in infancy, before\r\nBefore we could even know or understand\r\nThe implications of our wonderland.\r\nThere they all are, the legendary lies\r\nThe birthday treats, the sights, the sounds, the tears\r\nForgotten debris of forgotten years\r\nWaiting to be recalled, waiting to rise\r\nBefore our world dissolves before our eyes\r\nWaiting for some small, intimate reminder,\r\nA word, a tune, a known familiar scent\r\nAn echo from the past when, innocent\r\nWe looked upon the present with delight\r\nAnd doubted not the future would be kinder\r\nAnd never knew the loneliness of night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdge\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe woman is perfected.\r\nHer dead\r\nBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\r\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\r\nFlows in the scrolls of her toga,\r\nHer bare\r\nFeet seem to be saying:\r\nWe have come so far, it is over.\r\nEach dead child coiled, a white serpent,\r\nOne at each little\r\nPitcher of milk, now empty.\r\nShe has folded\r\nThem back into her body as petals\r\nOf a rose close when the garden\r\nStiffens and odors bleed\r\nFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.\r\nThe moon has nothing to be sad about,\r\nStaring from her hood of bone.\r\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\r\nHer blacks crackle and drag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening \r\nto empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the \r\nmass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots \r\nto make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; \r\nand home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it \r\nstubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, \r\nperishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the \r\nthickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there \r\nare left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, \r\ninsufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, \r\nwhen he walked on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Living Hand\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\r\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\r\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\r\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\r\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\r\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\r\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\r\nI hold it towards you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\r\nDylan Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nThe mill-stream, now that noises cease,\r\nIs all that does not hold its peace;\r\nUnder the bridge it murmurs by,\r\nAnd here are night and hell and I.\r\n\r\nWho made the world I cannot tell;\r\n\'Tis made, and here I am in hell.\r\nMy hand, though now my knuckles bleed,\r\nI never soiled with such a deed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, no doubt, in time gone by,\r\nSome have suffered more than I,\r\nWho only spend the night alone\r\nAnd strike my fist upon the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore \r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden \r\nby Ezra Pound\r\n\r\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\r\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\r\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\r\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd round about there is a rabble\r\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\r\nThey shall inherit the earth. \r\n\r\nIn her is the end of breeding.\r\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\r\nAnd is almost afraid that I\r\nwill commit that indiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLullaby\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\n\r\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\r\nHuman on my faithless arm:\r\nTime and fevers burn away\r\nIndividual beauty from\r\nThoughtful children, and the grave\r\nProves the child ephemeral:\r\nBut in my arms till break of day\r\nLet the living creature lie,\r\nMortal, guilty, but to me\r\nThe entirely beautiful.\r\n        \r\n\r\nSoul and body have no bounds:\r\nTo lovers as they lie upon\r\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\r\nIn their ordinary swoon,\r\nGrave the vision Venus sends\r\nOf supernatural sympathy,\r\nUniversal love and hope;\r\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\r\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\r\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\r\n        \r\n\r\nCertainty, fidelity\r\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\r\nLike vibrations of a bell\r\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\r\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\r\nEvery farthing of the cost.\r\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\r\nShall be paid, but from this night\r\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\r\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\r\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\r\nSoftly round your dreaming head\r\nSuch a day of welcome show\r\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\r\nFind our mortal world enough;\r\nNoons of dryness find you fed\r\nBy the involuntary powers,\r\nNights of insult let you pass\r\nWatched by every human love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most of It\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\r\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\r\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\r\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\r\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\r\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\r\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\r\nBut counterlove, original response.\r\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\r\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\r\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\r\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\r\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\r\nInstead of proving human when it neared\r\nAnd someone else additional to him,\r\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\r\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\r\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\r\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\r\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Flee from Me\r\n\r\nby\r\nThomas Wyatt\r\n\r\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\r\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\r\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\r\nThat now are wild and do not remember\r\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\r\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\r\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\r\n\r\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\r\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\r\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\r\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\r\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\r\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\r\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\r\n\r\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\r\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\r\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\r\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\r\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\r\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\r\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n by A.

Their tongues engrave\r\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\r\nOf broken intervals ...

But was it cognate, scored\r\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\r\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\r\nIn wounds pledged once to hope  cleft to despair?\r\n\r\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\r\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\r\nAs flings the question true?)  or is it she\r\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\r\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\r\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\r\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\r\n\r\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\r\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)  but slip\r\nOf pebbles,  visible wings of silence sown\r\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\r\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\r\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\r\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n\r\nby A.

but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\r\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\r\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose \r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\n Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\n\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\n\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\n\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\n\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\n\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\n Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\n\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\n\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\n I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Emily Dickinson\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nYou who desired so muchin vain to ask\r\nYet fed your hunger like an endless task,\r\nDared dignify the labor, bless the quest\r\nAchieved that stillness ultimately best,\r\n\r\nBeing, of all, least sought for:  Emily, hear!\r\nO sweet, dead Silencer, most suddenly clear\r\nWhen singing that Eternity possessed\r\nAnd plundered momently in every breast;\r\n\r\nTruly no flower yet withers in your hand,\r\nThe harvest you descried and understand\r\nNeeds more than wit to gather, love to bind.\r\nSome reconcilement of remotest mind\r\n\r\nLeaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.\r\nElse tears heap all within one clay-cold hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtue\r\nby George Herbert\r\n\r\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\r\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\r\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\nFor thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\nThy root is ever in its grave,\r\nAnd thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\r\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\r\nAnd all must die.\r\n\r\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\r\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\r\nThen chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Steal by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\r\n I had no human fears:\r\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\r\n The touch of earthly years.\r\n\r\nNo motion has she now, no force;\r\n She neither hears nor sees;\r\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\r\n With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCirque d\'Hiver \r\n\r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the floor flits the mechanical toy,\r\nfit for a king of several centuries back.\r\nA little circus horse with real white hair.\r\nHis eyes are glossy black.\r\nHe bears a little dancer on his back.\r\n\r\nShe stands upon her toes and turns and turns.\r\nA slanting spray of artificial roses\r\nis stitched across her skirt and tinsel bodice.\r\nAbove her head she poses\r\nanother spray of artificial roses.\r\n\r\nHis mane and tail are straight from Chirico.\r\nHe has a formal, melancholy soul.\r\nHe feels her pink toes dangle toward his back\r\nalong the little pole\r\nthat pierces both her body and her soul\r\n\r\nand goes through his, and reappears below,\r\nunder his belly, as a big tin key.\r\nHe canters three steps, then he makes a bow,\r\ncanters again, bows on one knee,\r\ncanters, then clicks and stops, and looks at me.\r\n\r\nThe dancer, by this time, has turned her back.\r\nHe is the more intelligent by far.\r\nFacing each other rather desperately\r\nhis eye is like a star\r\nwe stare and say, Well, we have come this far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art \r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day.  Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel.  None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch.  And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.  It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoman Fountain by Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nUp from the bronze, I saw\r\nWater without a flaw\r\nRush to its rest in air,\r\nReach to its rest, and fall.\r\n\r\nBronze of the blackest shade,\r\nAn element man-made,\r\nShaping upright the bare\r\nClear gouts of water in air.\r\n\r\nO, as with arm and hammer,\r\nStill it is good to strive\r\nTo beat out the image whole,\r\nTo echo the shout and stammer\r\nWhen full-gushed waters, alive,\r\nStrike on the fountain\'s bowl\r\nAfter the air of summer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountain Of Blood \r\n\r\nby Charles Baudelaire, as translated by Rachel Hadas\r\n\r\n\r\nA fountain\'s pulsing sobslike this my blood\r\nMeasures its flowing, so it sometimes seems.\r\nI hear a gentle murmur as it streams;\r\nWhere the wound lies I\'ve never understood.\r\n\r\nLike water meadows, boulevards are flooded.\r\nCobblestones, crisscrossed by scarlet rills,\r\nAre islands; creatures come and drink their fill.\r\nNothing in nature now remains unblooded.\r\n\r\nI used to hope that wine could bring me ease,\r\nCould lull asleep my deeply gnawing mind.\r\nI was a fool: the senses clear with wine.\r\n\r\nI looked to Love to cure my old disease.\r\nLove led me to a thicket of IVs\r\nWhere bristling needles thirsted for each vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls \r\nby E.\r\nE. Cummings\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\nare unbeautiful and have comfortable minds\r\n(also, with the church\'s protestant blessings\r\ndaughters, unscented shapeless spirited)\r\nthey believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,\r\nare invariably interested in so many things\r\nat the present writing one still finds\r\ndelighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?\r\nperhaps.  While permanent faces coyly bandy\r\nscandal of Mrs. N and Professor D\r\n.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above\r\nCambridge if sometimes in its box of\r\nsky lavender and cornerless, the\r\nmoon rattles like a fragment of angry candy \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Time of The Breaking of Nations \r\nby Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nOnly a man harrowing clods \r\n In a slow silent walk, \r\nWith an old horse that stumbles and nods \r\n Half asleep as they stalk. \r\n \r\nOnly thin smoke without flame\r\n From the heaps of couch grass: \r\nYet this will go onward the same \r\n Though Dynasties pass. \r\n \r\nYonder a maid and her wight \r\n Come whispering by;\r\nWar\'s annals will fade into night \r\n Ere their story die. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convergence Of The Twain by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nLines on the loss of the Titanic\r\n\r\nIn a solitude of the sea\r\nDeep from human vanity,\r\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\r\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\r\nOf her salamandrine fires,\r\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\r\nOver the mirrors meant\r\nTo glass the opulent\r\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\r\nJewels in joy designed\r\n To ravish the sensuous mind\r\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\r\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\r\n Gaze at the gilded gear\r\nAnd query: What does this vaingloriousness down here?...\r\nWell: while was fashioning\r\n This creature of cleaving wing,\r\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\r\n Prepared a sinister mate\r\n For herso gaily great\r\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\r\n And as the smart ship grew\r\n In stature, grace, and hue,\r\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\r\n Alien they seemed to be;\r\n No mortal eye could see\r\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\r\n Or sign that they were bent\r\n By paths coincident\r\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\r\n Till the Spinner of the Years\r\n Said Now! And each one hears,\r\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Richard Moore for suggesting the inclusion of this poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n    \r\n    Editor\'s Note:  Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\n    from Horace\'s Odes and means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\n    to die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long\r\n    duration Horace\r\n    \r\n    They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\n    Love and desire and hate:\r\n    I think they have no portion in us after\r\n    We pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\n    Out of a misty dream\r\n    Our path emerges for a while, then closes\r\n    Within a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n      Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\n    The day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\n    And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\n    Despair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\n    Broods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\n    Laughter or tears, for we have only known\r\n    Surpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\n    Have driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\n    Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\n    To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\n    Find end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\n    Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\n    Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\n    Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae \r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nI am not as I was under the reign of the good CynaraHorace\r\n\r\n      Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\r\n    \r\n    There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\r\n    Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\r\n    And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n    \r\n    All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\r\n    Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\r\n    Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\r\n    I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\r\n    Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\r\n    Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\r\n    But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\r\n    But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\r\n    Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\r\n    And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\r\n    Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\r\n    I have been faithful to thee, Cynara!

S. Lewis\r\n\r\nAll this is flashy rhetoric about loving you \r\nI never had a selfless thought since I was born.\r\nI am mercenary and self-seeking through and through;\r\nI want God, you, all friends merely to serve my turn.\r\n\r\nPeace, re-assurance, pleasure are the goals I seek;\r\nI cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin;\r\nI talk of love  a scholar\'s parrot may talk Greek,\r\nBut self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.\r\n\r\nOnly that you now have taught me (but how late!) my lack,\r\nI see the chasm; and everything you are was making\r\nMy heart into a bridge by which I might get back\r\nFrom exile and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.\r\nFor this I bless you as the ruin falls. The pains\r\nYou give me are more precious than all other gains.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Tony Marco for suggesting the inclusion of the\r\npoem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\n\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nNot in a silver casket cool with pearls\r\nOr rich with red corundum or with blue,\r\nLocked, and the key withheld, as other girls\r\nHave given their loves, I give my love to you;\r\nNot in a lovers\'-knot, not in a ring\r\nWorked in such fashion, and the legend plain\r\nSemper fidelis, where a secret spring\r\nKennels a drop of mischief for the brain:\r\nLove in the open hand, no thing but that,\r\nUngemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,\r\nAs one should bring you cowslips in a hat\r\nSwung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,\r\nI bring you, calling out as children do:\r\nLook what I have!And these are all for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Sweet, Crushed Angel \r\nby Hafiz, as translated by Daniel Ladinsky\r\n\r\n You have not danced so badly, my dear,\r\nTrying to hold hands with the Beautiful One.\r\n\r\nYou have waltzed with great style,\r\nMy sweet, crushed angel,\r\nTo have ever neared God\'s heart at all.\r\n\r\nOur Partner is notoriously difficult to follow,\r\nAnd even His best musicians are not always easy\r\n To hear.\r\n\r\nSo what if the music has stopped for a while.\r\n\r\n So what\r\nIf the price of admission to the Divine\r\n Is out of reach tonight.\r\n\r\n So what, my dear,\r\nIf you do not have the ante to gamble for Real Love.\r\n\r\n The mind and the body are famous\r\n For holding the heart ransom,\r\n\r\nBut Hafiz knows the Beloved\'s eternal habits.\r\n\r\n Have patience,\r\n\r\nFor He will not be able to resist your longing\r\n For Long.\r\n\r\nYou have not danced so badly, my dear,\r\n Trying to kiss the Beautiful One.\r\n\r\nYou have actually waltzed with tremendous style,\r\n O my sweet,\r\n O my sweet crushed angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any reward? \r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\nI am broken and bored,\r\nIs there any reward\r\nReassure me, Good Lord,\r\nAnd inform me about it.\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResume\r\nby Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nRazors pain you;\r\nRivers are damp;\r\nAcids stain you;\r\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\r\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\r\nNooses give;\r\nGas smells awful;\r\nYou might as well live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBright Star\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art\r\nNot in lone splendour hung aloft the night,\r\nAnd watching, with eternal lids apart,\r\nLike nature\'s patient sleepless eremite,\r\nThe moving waters at their priestlike task\r\nOf pure ablution round earth\'s human shores,\r\nOr gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\r\nOf snow upon the mountains and the moors;\r\nNo yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,\r\nPillow\'d upon my fair love\'s ripening breast,\r\nTo feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\r\nAwake for ever in a sweet unrest,\r\nStill, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\r\nAnd so live ever or else swoon to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart, we will forget him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nHeart, we will forget him,\r\nYou and I, tonight!\r\nYou must forget the warmth he gave,\r\nI will forget the light.\r\n\r\nWhen you have done pray tell me,\r\nThen I, my thoughts, will dim.\r\nHaste! lest while youre lagging\r\nI may remember him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave myself to him\r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\nI gave myself to him,\r\nAnd took himself for pay.\r\nThe solemn contract of a life\r\nWas ratified this way\r\n\r\nThe value might disappoint,\r\nMyself a poorer prove\r\nThan this my purchaser suspect,\r\nThe daily own of Love\r\n\r\nDepreciates the sight;\r\nBut, \'til the merchant buy,\r\nStill fabled, in the isles of spice\r\nThe subtle cargoes lie.\r\n\r\nAt least, \'tis mutual risk,\r\nSome found it mutual gain;\r\nSweet debt of Life, each night to owe,\r\nInsolvent, every noon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarewell, Love\r\nby Thomas Wyatt\r\nFarewell, Love, and all thy laws for ever:\r\nThy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.\r\nSenec and Plato call me from thy lore,\r\nTo perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour.\r\nIn blind error when I did persever,\r\nThy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,\r\nHath taught me to set in trifles no store,\r\nAnd scape forth, since liberty is lever*.

I do not think I would.\r\nOur thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\r\nI only know that summer sang in me\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more.Our thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dead Man Walking by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nThey hail me as one living, \r\nBut don\'t they know \r\nThat I have died of late years, \r\nUntombed although? \r\n\r\nI am but a shape that stands here, \r\nA pulseless mould, \r\nA pale past picture, screening \r\nAshes gone cold. \r\n\r\nNot at a minute\'s warning, \r\nNot in a loud hour, \r\nFor me ceased Time\'s enchantments \r\nIn hall and bower. \r\n\r\nThere was no tragic transit, \r\nNo catch of breath, \r\nWhen silent seasons inched me \r\nOn to this death .... \r\n\r\n A Troubadour-youth I rambled \r\nWith Life for lyre, \r\nThe beats of being raging \r\nIn me like fire. \r\n\r\nBut when I practised eyeing \r\nThe goal of men, \r\nIt iced me, and I perished \r\nA little then. \r\n\r\nWhen passed my friend, my kinsfolk, \r\nThrough the Last Door, \r\nAnd left me standing bleakly, \r\nI died yet more; \r\n\r\nAnd when my Love\'s heart kindled \r\nIn hate of me, \r\nWherefore I knew not, died I \r\nOne more degree. \r\n\r\nAnd if when I died fully \r\nI cannot say, \r\nAnd changed into the corpse-thing \r\nI am to-day, \r\n\r\nYet is it that, though whiling \r\nThe time somehow \r\nIn walking, talking, smiling, \r\nI live not now. \r\n\r\nOur thanks to Tom Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament \r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution \r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby E.

One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be \r\n\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\r\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\r\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\r\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\r\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\r\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\r\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\r\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\r\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\r\nNever have relish in the faery power\r\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\r\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\r\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying by,\r\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\r\nAnd the cloud that took the form\r\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\nOf a demon in my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dream Within a Dream by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nTake this kiss upon the brow!\r\nAnd, in parting from you now,\r\nThus much let me avow\r\nYou are not wrong, who deem\r\nThat my days have been a dream;\r\nYet if hope has flown away\r\nIn a night, or in a day,\r\nIn a vision, or in none,\r\nIs it therefore the less gone?\r\nAll that we see or seem\r\nIs but a dream within a dream.\r\n\r\nI stand amid the roar\r\nOf a surf-tormented shore,\r\nAnd I hold within my hand\r\nGrains of the golden sand\r\nHow few! yet how they creep\r\nThrough my fingers to the deep,\r\nWhile I weepwhile I weep!\r\nO God! can I not grasp\r\nThem with a tighter clasp?\r\nO God! can I not save\r\nOne from the pitiless wave?\r\nIs all that we see or seem\r\nBut a dream within a dream?\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Poems of Note\r\n\r\nDaddy by Sylvia Plath\r\nTulips\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\nIn Memory of W.
