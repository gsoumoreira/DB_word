For example Blake\'s The Tyger is the most-anthologized English poem. \nOther poems of his remain very popular with readers and critics. This page \nexplores the visionary poetry and visual art of one of England\'s most gifted \n(and eccentric) geniuses. \n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Ancient of Days"\n\nMy list of the ten best poems by William Blake is obviously subjective, so if \nyou disagree with my choices, please feel free to create your own ...\n\n(#10) The Chimney Sweeper\n(#9) The Garden of Love\n(#8) The Lamb\n(#7) The Tyger\n(#6) Holy Thursday\n(#5) Ah! Sunflower\n(#4) London\n(#3) Jerusalem\n(#2) The Sick Rose\n(#1) Cradle Song\n\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\n\nWilliam Blake may have been, in one of the ultimate ironies, both England\'s \ngreatest heretic and its greatest visionary prophet. Together with Dante and \nMilton, Blake completes a Trinity of great Christian poets, despite the fact \nthat none of them were Christians in the orthodox sense (Dante claimed to be \nsaved by his lover Beatrice and the pagan poet Virgil; Milton rather, than \njustifying the ways of God to man, made him seem like an unjust tyrant while \nturning Lucifer, Adam and Eve into Romantic heroes for the ages; Blake denied \nthe need for anyone to save him, least of all the biblical god, whom he called \nNobodaddy). \n\nThe Sick Rose\nby William Blake\n\nO Rose, thou art sick.\nThe invisible worm\nThat flies in the night\nIn the howling storm\n\nHas found out thy bed\nOf crimson joy,\nAnd his dark secret love\nDoes thy life destroy.\n\nAccording to Blake, human society and its institutions were sick, and the cure \nrequired a combination of revelation, imagination, right thinking, compassion, \nfierce tenacity and love. He believed the black-robed priests of religion had \nnailed a thou shalt not sign over the garden of earthly delights, robbing \nadults of pleasure and children of hope. He vowed to not let his pen rest in his \nhand until he had won the Mental Fight to transform the dreary London of his \nday into a new Jerusalem. Today, as we witness the suffering inflicted on \ninnocent children all around the globe in the name of state, industry and \nreligion, it behooves us to consider joining that Mental Fight on the side of \nBlake and his Rebel Angels.\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Angel of Revelation"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Angels Hovering Over the Body of Jesus Christ in the Sepulcher"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Jacob\'s Ladder"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Hecate"\n\nIn my opinion William Blake (1757-1827) is the most important poet/artist of all time. Why? Because \nhe helped change the world and in changing the world he saved many innocent children \nfrom lives of drudgery and misery terminated by premature deaths. While he wrote many \nwonderful poems and was also a talented painter, printer and engraver, what \nmakes Blake the most important of poets and artists is the change his work wrought in human \nhearts, minds and consciences. No great poet ever wrote more compassionately about children. For instance, take this poem of Blake\'s, one of \nthe loveliest lullabies in the English language:\n\nCradle Song\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n\nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n\nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\nWilliam Blake was a mystic: like Walt Whitman he displayed an affinity for all \nlife in his poetry ...\n\nAh! Sunflower\nby William Blake\n\nAh! sunflower, weary of time,\nWho countest the steps of the sun,\nSeeking after that sweet golden clime\nWhere the travellers journey is done;\n\nWhere the youth pined away with desire,\nAnd the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\nArise from their graves and aspire;\nWhere my sunflower wishes to go.\n\nBlake was the first artist to graphically depict the horrors of slavery ... you \ncan see a slave ship departing in the background ...\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "A Negro Hung Alive"\n\n\nBlake was at the forefront of the British abolitionist movement, not only in \nopposing slavery, but also in advocating the equality of the races, as we shall see \nin the following poem (the full poem follows the plates and is much easier to \nread):\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "The Little Black Boy" (First Plate)\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "The Little Black Boy" (First Plate)\n\nThe Little Black Boy\n\n\nMy mother bore me in the southern wild,\nAnd I am black, but O! my soul is white;\nWhite as an angel is the English child,\nBut I am black, as if bereav\'d of light.\n\nMy mother taught me underneath a tree,\nAnd sitting down before the heat of day,\nShe took me on her lap and kissed me,\nAnd pointing to the east, began to say:\n\nLook on the rising sun: there God does live,\nAnd gives his light, and gives his heat away;\nAnd flowers and trees and beasts and men receive\nComfort in morning, joy in the noonday.\n\nAnd we are put on earth a little space,\nThat we may learn to bear the beams of love;\nAnd these black bodies and this sunburnt face\nIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.\n\nFor when our souls have learn\'d the heat to bear,\nThe cloud will vanish; we shall hear his voice,\nSaying: "Come out from the grove, my love  care,\nAnd round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.\'\'\n\nThus did my mother say, and kissed me;\nAnd thus I say to little English boy:\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy,\n\nI\'ll shade him from the heat, till he can bear\nTo lean in joy upon our father\'s knee;\nAnd then I\'ll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him, and he will then love me.\n\nBlake also spoke clearly and forthrightly for equality between the races in his \nvisual art. He depicted the horrors of racism and slavery more graphically than he did \nany other horrors ...\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Flagellation of a Female Samboe Slave"\n\n... but he seemed to go beyond that to "connect" the suffering of slaves with \nthe lot of suffering mankind, even poets, symbolized in the second image below by Los ...\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Urizen in Fetters, Tears streaming from His Eyes"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Los, Symbol of Poetic Genius, Consumed by Flames"\n\nBlake and other early Romantic poets including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor \nColeridge and Robert Southey, opposed slavery. In 1796 John Gabriel Stedman, a \nmercenary, published his memoirs of a five-year expedition against ex-slaves in \nSurinam; his book included a number of engraved illustrations by Blake depicting \nthe horrifically cruel treatment of recaptured slaves. The first of these engravings has been "construed as an \nexplicit attack on the slave trade" because Blake depicted "the skulls of the \nmurdered slaves looking out over the sea to a slave ship in the distance while \nthe most recent victim of plantation cruelty swings on the gallows in the \nforeground." These images were unique at that time for their graphic depiction of human suffering. \nStedman\'s book and Blake\'s illustrations became part of abolitionist literature.\n\nAccording to the "William Blake Biography" the poet was a "prophet against empire" who opposed slavery \n"over the course of his lifetime. Through his poetry and art "he was able both to counter pro-slavery propaganda \nand to complicate typical abolitionist verse and sentiment with a profound and unique exploration of the effects \nof enslavement and the varied processes of empire."\n\nAccording to the same biography, Blake\'s Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793) "explores the psychologically \ndamaging effects of enslavement upon its victims and also caricatures the political debate over \nabolition in Britain. The triangular relationship between Oothoon the female \nslave, Bromion the slave-driver, and Theotormon the jealous but inhibited former \nlover, depicts the sufferings of those subjugated by the trade itself and mimics \nthe position of the pro-slavery, vested-interest lobby and that of wavering \nabolitionists [who opposed slavery in theory without strongly opposing its \nactual practice] ...\n\nThe biography concludes: Blake was among the few British writers \nwho actively advocated slave rebellion and believed that it was at the edges of \nempire that true revolutions would occur."\n\nOnly Michelangelo ranks with William Blake, among great artists who also wrote superior poetry, \nin combined achievement. But Michelangelo didn\'t rock the civilized world to its \nfoundations the way Blake did, so Blake also gets my vote as the most important \nartist of all time.\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Michael Foretells the Crucifixion"\n\nHow, exactly, did Blake rock the foundations of the world? By being a social critic and reformer akin to the \nHebrew prophets. Here, for instance, is his bleak vision of the London of his day:\n\nLondon\n\nI wander thro\' each charter\'d street,\nNear where the charter\'d Thames does flow,\nAnd mark in every face I meet\nMarks of weakness, marks of woe.\nIn every cry of every Man,\nIn every Infant\'s cry of fear,\nIn every voice, in every ban,\nThe mind-forg\'d manacles I hear.\nHow the Chimney-sweeper\'s cry\nEvery blackning Church appalls,\nAnd the hapless Soldier\'s sigh\nRuns in blood down Palace walls.\nBut most thro\' midnight streets I hear\nHow the youthful Harlot\'s curse\nBlasts the new-born Infant\'s tear\nAnd blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.\n\nHere, as in other of his poems, Blake reveals the schizophrenia of a society of \nBible-believing, church-going adults who inexplicably allowed children to work \nas chimneysweeps: an always-dangerous, sometimes-deadly occupation. Today\'s \nchildren of Gaza can no doubt sympathize with defenseless English children who \nsuffered and died in the shadows of those despicable churches. While Jews and \nChristians raise hymns to God, and elect themselves the "Chosen Few," \ncompletely innocent Palestinian children live in abject fear and misery. Like \nBlake, I find that appalling.\nIf you are a student, teacher, educator, peace \nactivist or just someone who cares and wants to help, please read \n\nHow Can We End Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide Forever?\nand do what you can to make the world a safer, happier place for \nchildren of all races and creeds.\n\n\nBlake was also a fierce critic of \nwhat Dwight D. Eisenhower would later call "the military-industrial complex." Blake \nhad a more evocative term for factories that churned out implements of war \nand death: "Satanic mills." Blake is thus the forefather of virtually \nevery singer-songwriter who ever wrote a protest song. Before Blake, few poets \nand minstrels had the nerve to criticize church and state. After Blake, many of \nthem would come to consider dissent a sacred task. Songwriters who followed in Blake\'s \nfootsteps as critics of the military-industrial complex include Woody Guthrie, \nPeter Seeger, Bob Dylan, John \nLennon, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Jim Morrison, Marvin Gaye, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "The Number of the Beast is 666"\n\n\nHow influential did Blake become? According to John Lennon\'s FBI files, when the \n"fantastically nervous" Beatles met Bob Dylan for the first time and there was \nan uncomfortable initial silence, broken by Lennon snarling an insult at Allen Ginsburg, the unperturbed \nBeat poet plopped himself down in Lennon\'s \nlap, looked up and asked him, "Have you ever read William Blake, young \nman?" Lennon, in his best "Liverpudlian deadpan" replied, "Never heard of the \nman." But his wife Cynthia chided him, "Oh, John, stop lying!" and that "broke the ice."\n\nIt\'s interesting that Blake was the first "connection" and ice breaker between Dylan, Lennon and \nGinsburg. Why did such super-hip modern dissident artists admire Blake? Probably because they were idealists longing for Utopia (or, at the \nvery least, for radical social change) and Blake had urged his readers to cast off the "mind-forged \nmanacles" of hidebound religious and political thinking, in order to \nchange the dreary London of his day into a Mecca he called Jerusalem:\n\nJerusalem\n\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\nWalk upon England\'s mountains green?\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\nOn England\'s pleasant pastures seen?\n\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\nAmong these dark Satanic mills?\n\nBring me my bow of burning gold:\nBring me my arrows of desire:\nBring me my spear: O clouds unfold!\nBring me my chariot of fire.\n\nI will not cease from mental fight,\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand\nTill we have built Jerusalem\nIn England\'s green and pleasant land.\n\nPlease note that Blake said till we have built \nJerusalem. \nBlake\'s "Jerusalem" is based on the legend that Jesus once visited England as a \nboy or young man. But what is most \nsurprising about the poem is Blake\'s activism. He didn\'t just mope and complain \nabout the problems he saw: he called for his spiritual and intellectual \nweaponry, vowing not to let his "sword" (i.e., his pen) sleep in his hand \nuntil London had become the new Jerusalem. The poem was later turned into a \nstirring hymn (one of my mother\'s favorites):\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Portrait of Milton"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Satan in Glory"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake "The Song of Los"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Sata Amor Adao Eva"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Eve Tempted by the Serpent"\n\nFrom what I understand of Blake, he didn\'t subscribe to the idea that Jesus was \na sacrifice. In the Laoco\xf6n engraving he wrote, \nJesus and his Apostles and his Disciples were all Artists ... The Old and New \nTestaments are the Great Code of Art. Art is the Tree of Life. God is Jesus. \nWhen he says that God is Jesus, I take Blake to mean that Jesus is where \ndivinity and humanity intersect and become one. When he said of Jesus that He \nis the only God ... and so am I and so are you, Blake was agreeing with Muslim \nSufi mystics who claim to be one with God, and with Christian mystics who say \nthe same thing, and with the mystics and shamans of many other religions as \nwell. The best explanation I have heard of this common mystical belief is that \nGod is the great sea of unity and that each human being is like an individual \nwave rising from that sea and collapsing back into it. While it seems unlikely \nthat anyone can prove this to be true, it is interesting that the idea recurs \nover and over again around the globe and throughout time. So perhaps Blake was \ncorrect to speak of The Everlasting Gospel and describe it as being unchanged \nfrom greatest antiquity. For the mystic the Holy Trinity and a human family may \nbe one and the same: Father, Mother and Child. Due to the chauvinism of the \nwriters of the Bible, the female member of the Trinity (the Hebrew word SHEKHINA \nis feminine) was virtually written out of existence, becoming the oddly but \nperhaps aptly named Holy Ghost. Blake also denied that Mary was a virgin, \nwhich wasn\'t a problem for him because he considered sex to be good, not a \nsin.\n\nWhen Blake criticized the orthodox Christian vision of Jesus, he did so with "an imagination and \nexcessiveness that has rarely been matched." Blake\'s Jesus was not a moralizing \npreacher, philosopher or savior, but "the \nvery embodiment of the poetic" and a "supremely creative being above rigid \ndogma, above harsh logic, above even morality. Jesus explodes from the pages of \nBlake\'s poetry with a fierce apocalypticism far removed from the eminently \nrational Enlightenment Jesus." Blake\'s Jesus "becomes more than just a thinker \nor a moralizer, he becomes a symbol of being, of the vital and non-dualistic \nrelationship between divinity and humanity." These opening lines from The \nEverlasting Gospel illustrate Blake\'s extreme distaste for what orthodoxy had \ndone to the reputation of Jesus Christ:\n\nThe Everlasting Gospel\n\n\nTHE VISION OF CHRIST that thou dost see\nIs my visions greatest enemy.\nThine has a great hook nose like thine;\nMine has a snub nose like to mine.\nThine is the Friend of all Mankind;\nMine speaks in parables to the blind.\nThine loves the same world that mine hates;\nThy heaven doors are my hell gates.\nSocrates taught what Meletus\nLoathd as a nations bitterest curse,\nAnd Caiaphas was in his own mind\nA benefactor to mankind.\nBoth read the Bible day and night,\nBut thou readst black where I read white.\n\nWith Blake\'s imaginative reinterpretation of Milton, Satan, Jesus, the Bible and \nChristianity, an English \n"Romantic" movement began to form and soon expressed itself: primarily through poetry, \nprose and art. England managed to avoid the more violent extremes of the \nAmerican and French Revolutions, but the desire for freedom and equality burned \njust as heatedly in English breasts as it did in those of Americans and \nFrenchmen. So it\'s not surprising that England produced six of its greatest \npoets within a relatively short period of time: first Blake, then Wordsworth, \nColeridge, Byron, Shelley and Keats. Each of the six seemed to coin a new, man-centric religion. Each of the six was \nto some degree a heir of Blake\'s \nreinterpreted Milton. Within a few years, other strikingly unique voices would \nemerge, chief among them Walt Whitman, a romantic poet-prophet in the vein of \nBlake. Like Blake, Whitman was a mystic, with a belief in the "oneness" and equality of \nall life.Blake seems \nto have made a definite impression on Whitman, as Whitman had his death-crypt \nmodeled after Blake\'s "Death\'s Door" ...\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake "Death\'s Door"\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Songs of Innocence"\n\nSongs of Innocence: The Chimney Sweeper\n\nWhen my mother died I was very young,\nAnd my father sold me while yet my tongue\nCould scarcely cry \'weep! \'weep! \'weep! \'weep!\nSo your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.\n\nThere\'s little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,\nThat curled like a lamb\'s back, was shaved: so I said,\n"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head\'s bare,\nYou know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."\n\nAnd so he was quiet; and that very night,\nAs Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight,\nThat thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,\nWere all of them locked up in coffins of black.\n\nAnd by came an angel who had a bright key,\nAnd he opened the coffins and set them all free;\nThen down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,\nAnd wash in a river, and shine in the sun.\n\nThen naked and white, all their bags left behind,\nThey rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;\nAnd the angel told Tom, if he\'d be a good boy,\nHe\'d have God for his father, and never want joy.\n\nAnd so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark,\nAnd got with our bags and our brushes to work.\nThough the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm;\nSo if all do their duty they need not fear harm.\n\nSongs of Experience: The Chimney Sweeper\n\nA little black thing in the snow,\nCrying "\'weep! \'weep!" in notes of woe!\nWhere are thy father and mother? Say!\n"They are both gone up to the church to pray.\n\n"Because I was happy upon the heath,\nAnd smiled among the winter\'s snow,\nThey clothed me in the clothes of death,\nAnd taught me to sing the notes of woe.\n\n"And because I am happy and dance and sing,\nThey think they have done me no injury,\nAnd are gone to praise God and his priest and king,\nWho make up a heaven of our misery."\n\nBlake wrote one collection of poems called Songs of Innocence, and \nanother called Songs of Experience. The poems of the first collection \nlook at the world from the vantage of childish innocence, while the poems of the \nsecond collection view the same world through the eyes of experience. In both \npoems above we can feel Blake\'s tender empathy for suffering children. \nIn both poems the child chimneysweeps are so young they can\'t pronounce the "s" \nin "sweep" and so mispronounce their job titles. If the first poem seems \nhopeful, it may be simply because children are inclined to be hopeful, due to \ntheir innocence. The second poem is much darker and we sense Blake\'s fury with \nreligious people who go to church and "pray" while innocent children suffer and \ndie. What would he make of Jews and Christian today, who go to churches and \nsynagogues, and endlessly read and study the Bible, but don\'t know better than to allow the children of Gaza to suffer and \ndie needlessly? I have no doubt that he would think as little of them as he did of the \nslavemasters who used and abused children in the "jolly old England" \nof his day.\n\nHere are two more poems from the same collections:\n\nSongs of Innocence: Holy Thursday\n\n\'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,\nThe children walking two & two, in red & blue & green,\nGrey-headed beadles walk\'d before, with wands as white as snow,\nTill into the high dome of Paul\'s they like Thames\' waters flow.\n\nO what a multitude they seem\'d, these flowers of London town!\nSeated in companies they sit with radiance all their own.\nThe hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,\nThousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands.\n\nNow like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,\nOr like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among.\nBeneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;\nThen cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.\n\nSongs of Experience: Holy Thursday\n\nIs this a holy thing to see,\nIn a rich and fruitful land,\nBabes reduced to misery,\nFed with cold and usurous hand?\n\nIs that trembling cry a song!\nCan it be a song of joy?\nAnd so many children poor,\nIt is a land of poverty!\n\nAnd their sun does never shine.\nAnd their fields are bleak & bare.\nAnd their ways are fill\'d with thorns\nIt is eternal winter there.\n\nFor where-e\'er the sun does shine,\nAnd where-e\'er the rain does fall:\nBabe can never hunger there,\nNor poverty the mind appall.\n\nThe "Holy Thursday" of Songs of Innocence describes \nthe celebration of the ascension of Jesus. On this day, children from the charity schools of \nLondon were marched to a service at St. Paul\'s Cathedral. The beadles were the \nmen in charge of keeping order. In the last \nstanza of the poem, the children are singing in the balcony and the beadles \nare seated below them. The final line is an allusion to Hebrews 13:2, "Be not \nforgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels \nunawares."\n\nThe "Holy Thursday" from Songs of Experience describes the same ceremony. \nWhen Blake says "It is eternal winter there," he seems to be saying that a \nchurch that denies innocent children food \nand a decent life is utterly lacking in light and warmth.\n\nHere are two more poems from the same collections:\n\nSongs of Innocence: The Lamb\n\nLittle Lamb, who made thee?\nDost thou know who made thee?\nGave thee life & bid thee feed,\nBy the stream & o\'er the mead;\nGave thee clothing of delight,\nSoftest clothing, wooly, bright;\nGave thee such a tender voice,\nMaking all the vales rejoice?\nLittle Lamb, who made thee?\nDost thou know who made thee?\n\nLittle Lamb, I\'ll tell thee,\nLittle Lamb, I\'ll tell thee:\nHe is called by thy name,\nFor he calls himself a Lamb.\nHe is meek & he is mild;\nHe became a little child.\nI a child & thou a lamb.\nWe are called by his name.\nLittle Lamb, God bless thee!\nLittle Lamb, God bless thee!\n\nSongs of Experience: The Tyger\n\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes!\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire!\n\nAnd what shoulder, & what art.\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\nWhat dread hand! & what dread feet!\n\nWhat the hammer! what the chain,\nIn what furnace was thy brain\nWhat the anvil, what dread grasp,\nDare its deadly terrors clasp!\n\nWhen the stars threw down their spear\nAnd water\'d heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee!\n\nTyger Tyger burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night:\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry!\n\n"The Lamb" from Songs of Innocence is highly symbolic. The lamb simultaneously symbolizes innocence, a human child, and Jesus.\n\n"The Tyger" symbolizes experience, an adult and perhaps the Anti-Christ. A predator kills constantly. The poem asks the question: "Did he \nwho made the lamb make thee!" but with an exclamation mark rather than a question mark. Blake may be asking: are the men who inflict such suffering on \ninnocent children even human? He may have found it difficult to reconcile his humanity to the inhumanity of men capable of such brutality and \nutter disregard for the suffering of innocents.\n\nHere are two more poems from the same collections:\n\nSongs of Innocence:\nThe Divine Image\n\nTo Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nAll pray in their distress;\nAnd to these virtues of delight\nReturn their thankfulness.\n\nFor Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs God, our father dear,\nAnd Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love\nIs Man, his child and care.\n\nFor Mercy has a human heart,\nPity a human face,\nAnd Love, the human form divine,\nAnd Peace, the human dress.\n\nThen every man, of every dime\nThat prays in his distress,\nPrays to the human form divine,\nLove, Mercy, Pity, Peace.\n\nAnd all must love the human form,\nIn heathen, turk, or jew;\nWhere Mercy, Love & Pity dwell\nThere God is dwelling too.\n\nSongs of Experience: The Human Abstract\n\n\nPity would be no more,\nIf we did not make somebody Poor:\nAnd Mercy no more could be,\nIf all were as happy as we;\n\nAnd mutual fear brings peace;\nTill the selfish loves increase.\nThen Cruelty knits a snare,\nAnd spreads his baits with care.\n\nHe sits down with holy fears,\nAnd waters the ground with tears:\nThen Humility takes its root\nUnderneath his foot.\n\nSoon spreads the dismal shade\nOf Mystery over his head;\nAnd the Catterpiller and Fly,\nFeed on the Mystery.\n\nAnd it bears the fruit of Deceit,\nRuddy and sweet to eat;\nAnd the Raven his nest has made\nIn its thickest shade.\n\nThe Gods of the earth and sea,\nSought thro\' Nature to find this Tree\nBut their search was all in vain:\nThere grows one in the Human Brain\n\n"The Divine Image" of Songs of Innocence attributes the virtues of \nMercy, Pity, Peace, and Love to the human form and says that where these virtues \nexist, "there God is dwelling too." Blake thus makes the point that if God dwells in every human being, \nracism is nonsensical.\n\n"The Divine Image" of Songs of \nExperience appeared in only one copy of Songs of \nInnocence and Experience. Many critics and scholars believe this is because Blake \nconsidered the better companion poem for "The Divine Image" to be "The Human Abstract."\n\n\n"The Human Abstract" also attributes Pity and Mercy to the human form, but \nsuggests that we feel pity and practice mercy only after we have caused other \npeople to suffer. Once again Blake seems to criticize religion, this time for \ncreating holy fears (perhaps the fear of hell) and false humility. The result \nis darkness (perhaps superstition and false teachings) and deceit. The origin of \nsuch things is not God or Nature, but the Human Brain, which produces bad \ntheology and uncompassionate, unjust religions.\n\nBlake was perhaps the most spiritual and mystical of English poets. He recorded having \nvisions of angels and said that he saw and conversed with the angel Gabriel, Mary, and various historical figures. At age four he had a vision of God \nlooking at him through a window. Around age nine he had a vision of "a tree \nfilled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars." On \nanother occasion, Blake "watched haymakers at work and thought he saw angelic \nfigures walking among them." Blake also believed that he was personally \ninstructed and encouraged by Archangels.\n\nIn a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote: "[The town \nof] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than \nLondon. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not \nobstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly \nheard, & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of \ntheir houses. My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... \nI am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain \nare studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & \npainted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight \n& Study of Archangels."\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote: "Now I may say to \nyou, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone \ncarry on my visionary studies in London unannoy\'d, & that I may converse with my \nfriends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables \nunobserv\'d & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts \nproceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we \nDoubt our Friends."\n\nIn one of his more mystical passages Blake wrote:\n\n"To see a world in a grain of sand\nAnd heaven in a wild flower\nHold infinity in the palm of your hand\nAnd eternity in an hour."\n\n"If the doors of perception were cleansed \neverything would appear to man as it is:\nInfinite."\n\n"He who binds to himself a joy,\nDoes the winged life destroy;\nHe who kisses the joy as it flies,\nLives in Eternity\'s sun rise."\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "The Parable of the Wise  Foolish Virgins"\n\nAccording to Jonathan Jones, art critic for The Guardian, Blake is "far \nand away the greatest [visual] artist Britain has ever produced." Blake has also \nbeen included among the top forty artists of all time by G. Fern\xe1ndez and has \nbeen called one of the greatest artists by John Ruskin, John Maynard, Henry \nFuseli, John Flaxman, Alexander Gilchrist and Ita Marguet, among others. Harold \nBloom, perhaps the best-known of modern literary critics, included Blake in his \nlist of the 100 greatest geniuses of all time, calling him a visionary akin to \nDante, Milton and Shelley. But perhaps the best measure of the genius of William \nBlake is his influence on other poets and artists, including especially the \nRomantics, and through them the Modernists and Post-Modernists. William \nWordsworth, the leading figure among the early Romantics, offered this verdict \nafter Blake\'s death: "There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there \nis something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity \nof Lord Byron and Walter Scott."\n\nBlake might be considered the first major Romantic poet, because he \ncombined imagination and individuality with contempt for mindless orthodoxy. He \nwas a modern Prometheus, shaking off the chains of orthodoxy and \nauthoritarianism, to seek the holy inner fire of passionate imagination.\n\nBlake\'s "long, flowing lines and violent energy, combined with aphoristic \nclarity and moments of lyric tenderness" heralded the free verse of poets like \nWhitman. Where poets of the past had been poets of form and \nprecision, Blake was a poet of freer-flowing energy, passion and imagination. After Blake, \npoets like Alexander Pope would often seem conventional and dull, for all their \ntalent, skill and dexterity. Blake raised the bar by caring deeply about his \nsubjects, and by requiring his readers to care and respond passionately in return.\n\nBlake also influenced the pre-Raphaelites, Allen Ginsburg and the \nBeat poets, the Underground Movement, the "counter culture," Percy Bysshe \nShelley, Algernon Charles Swinburne, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, C. \nS. Lewis, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, U2, Salman Rushdie, Phillip Pullman ("His Dark \nMaterials"), Orson Scott Card, et al. The modern graphic novel can clearly trace its \nroots to Blake\'s illuminated poems and prophetic books. And it seems likely that \nevery major anti-war and anti-orthodoxy figure since Blake has been influenced \nto some degree by him.\n\nJim Morrison based the name of his rock group, the Doors, \non Blake\'s "doors of perception."\nBob Dylan collaborated with Allen Ginsberg to record two Blake songs. Ginsberg \neven claimed that Blake\'s spirit had communicated musical settings of several Blake poems \nto him. In 1948 he had an auditory hallucination of Blake reading his poems "Ah, \nSunflower," "The Sick Rose," and "Little Girl Lost" (later referred to as his \n"Blake vision"). Patti Smith was heavily influenced by Blake, referring to him \nin her song "My Blakean Year" and also reciting his poetry \nbefore some of her songs.\n\nWilliam Rossetti called Blake a "glorious luminary," and described him as "a man \nnot forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to \nbe replaced by known or readily surmisable successors."\n\nIn 1793\'s Visions of the Daughters of Albion, Blake condemned the \ncruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the \nright of women to complete self-fulfillment. He abhorred the black-robed \npriests of organized religion who erected a Thou shalt not sign over his \ngarden of earthly love ...\n\n\nThe Garden Of Love\nby William Blake\n\nI laid me down upon a bank,\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\nI heard among the rushes dank\nWeeping, weeping.\n\nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\n\nI went to the Garden of Love,\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\nWhere I used to play on the green.\n\nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\nAnd "Thou shalt not," writ over the door;\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\n\nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\n\nBlake was the inventor of relief etching, or illuminated printing, a method he \nused to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. He also \nemployed intaglio engraving, most notably for the illustrations of the Book of \nJob.\n\nBlake\'s trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803, when he was \ninvolved in a physical altercation with a soldier called John Schofield. Blake \nwas charged not only with assault, but also with uttering seditious and \ntreasonable expressions against the King. Schofield claimed that Blake had \nexclaimed, "Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves." Blake would be cleared \nin the Chichester assizes of the charges. According to a report in the Sussex \ncounty paper, "The invented character of [the evidence] was ... so obvious that \nan acquittal resulted." Schofield was later depicted wearing "mind forged \nmanacles" in an illustration to Jerusalem.\n\nBlake revolted against the established institutions of his time, saying: \n"Prisons are built with stones of Law, brothels with bricks of Religion."\n\nHe sided with the rebellious fallen angels of Milton\'s "Paradise Lost" and \nattacked conventional religious views, particularly those that called sex "evil" \nand thus opposed human happiness. Some of Blake\'s contemporaries called \nhim a harmless lunatic, but by advocating free love and opposing misery-inducing \nreligious orthodoxy, he was simply light years ahead of his time. In Blake\'s \ncase it \nseems madness really is "divinest sense."\n\nOne of Blake\'s lifelong concerns was to free the soul and its natural energies from \nthe hidebound "reason" of organized religion. He hated the grimy, sooty effects \nof the Industrial Revolution in England and looked forward to the establishment \nof a New Jerusalem "in England\'s green and pleasant land." His personal religion was \nfreedom, tolerance and the pursuit of happiness, without artificial limitations \nand impediments. To him, religious orthodoxy was like a speed bump in the middle \nof racetrack. He had a heart of all human suffering. But perhaps his greatest \nenduring legacy is his tender empathy for \nchildren, and his fierce, passionate defense of them.\n\n\n\nWilliam Blake\'s "Job"\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
