the boxes\nsealed and no one\ngetting a bead on you\n\nwherever you\'re moving\nit would be by airnot the kind\nthat comes from runways\n\nbut cardboard, corrugated\nwhere its turbulence is hidden\nat least till high enough\n\nsafely under your arms\nstill closing the flaps\nand though the wings are taped\n\nthey\'re already breaking apart\nheld the heading too long\nyou thought this place\n\nwould last out the month\nnot burn to the floor\nbecome winds and your emptiness.\n\n\nThere is no tunnel, you crawl\nthe way a turtle takes hold\nand from the sidewalk a dry breeze\n\nsmelling from salt and two in the afternoon\nthe crowd thinks the cup is for beggars\nfill it so the air inside\n\nwill rise and you can breathe\none more time :a tide\nlets you survive in the open\n\nthough one cheek is dragged\nover the other till your mouth\nbecomes a shellall you can do\n\nis drink from it\ndo what skies once did\nfilled with thirst and emptiness.\n\n*\n\nWith roots that glow in the dark\nyou approach each grave\nthe way all wood remembers\n\nits first wish was moonlight\nand overwhelmed the Earth\nas mornings that grow only in dirt \n\nyou lean across, breathing in\nbreathing out to exchange places\nthough the ground is decorated\n\nwith nothing more than itself\nstubborn, still filled for campfires\nand all around are the beads\n\noutlined in the shadows, woven\nslowly row by row, fondled\nand endless songs about travelers.\n\n*\n\nIts a rickety table, not sure\nwhere the bend in the river\nbrushes against weeds and mud \n\nthis watering cant last\nhas already broken apart\nthe way every tree is carved\n\nby those endless seas\nher initials are used to\nas kisses and your mouth \n\nwood cant save you now\nthough everything you wet\nis circling the Earth for her \n\nyou will die from thirst\none after the other, counted\nwithout the summer you needed.\n\n*\n\nAnd though you dread the mail\nthis note is used to her arms\nfolding over your eyes\n\nbrushing aside the dust\nthats unimportant now \nyou cant make out the name\n\nfloating up as salt, empty\nwith some small sea beginning\nclings the way every envelope\n\n\nis carried along, half evenings\nhalf sinking back into darkness\nand word after word while they last.\n\n*\n\nIts shadow is helpless here\nfestering the way your fingers\nlean over the watermarks\n\nnot yet covered with paper\nthough left in the open\nthis wall could heal, the butterflies\n\ngently circling down\nand under the painted leaves\nthe empty branches and wings \n\nyou thin this paste\nas if one arm works the other\ntill what you turn in\n\nunfolds toward painful corners\nand days without a sea\nmaking room for you.\n\n*\n\nBefore there were seeds these stones\ngot their start from here, each shell\nshaped by snowfalls and emptiness \n\nyou work this orchard\nthe way each grave stays open\nfor air and the sharp pebble\n\nthat feeds the Earth with silence\nalready beginning to slowly\nin secret harden just like that\n\nyou put into place a shadow\nthat is not your hand folded over\nfor seasons keeping track\n\nhow lush and without a leaf\nwaits for its darkness to surface\nlet go and place to place.\n\n*\n\nYou trick both thumbs into sunlight\nthe way footpaths squeeze the dead\nthough you cant breathe at night \n\nunless this kettle is lit you can see\nwhere these matches end over end\nare climbing midair its the mirage\n\nheat uses to add water the stove\nwith nothing inside, at attention\nfrom the day it was asked.\n\nYou belittle the directions, this paint\nneeds thinningit\'s not safe\nthough for now you hold on more than ever\n\nthe way a flower inside another flower\nspreads out when you add rainwater\nas if this wall was still on fire\n\nsurrounding you, yelling at you to paint\nwith the window open, jump! the air\nhas nothing left, needs time, years\n\nthe paint is new at this\ncan\'t dry by itself, half brush marks, half\nmotionless, already those exhausted stones\n\nno longer overflowing near the dead\nthe broken glass helps, emptiness helps\nonce on the ground and alongside your hands\n\nremembers to enter this room back and forth\nas if you were being watched, counted on\nare sweeping it clean for later and later.\n\n*\n\nThis heat still underfoot\nreminds you how the sun\nwould come to your grave\'s edge\n\nwith flowers, with a sky\nwhose season now is lost\nand the listening\n\nthat goes on forever.\nYou can tell from the silence\nI\'m standing close, my footmarks\n\nstopped for a while we are both dead.\nWho but you would think about daylight\nhow colors tire so easily here\n\nbiding their time, listening\nto one foot beside the other\nnever letting go and the warmth.\n\n*\n\nAs if for the last time you let go\nthe way the sun looks back in sadness\nand circling down without a sound\n\nyou make a pile from the discarded\nand with the warmth still in your hands\nyou stare at the sky without blinking\n\nthough what rises from the ground\nis lifeless, sets out on the weaker side\nas shadow :a shell kept empty for calm\n\nfor leaf by blinding leaf and this smoke\nhalf there, half anchored against the rake\nleft to rust, no longer struggling\n\ndragged under, exhausted and the light\nwears away, becomes air again\nholds your mouth open for dirt and gentleness.\n\n*\n\nEven this tree :a stranglehold\nonce used for calling you and now\nmeans the night this low branch\nstill ruffling feathers\ncan\'t recover its faint cry\nits warm breeze that shelters you\n\nnow that every stone is sealed\nis pressed to my lips\nas if some trumpet or fountain\nor filled with ecstasy\nready this time even the sun\n\nbroken in two and now\nyour light darkens half the sky\nglows over my arms and the moon\nthat can\'t look away :this digging\n\nhas to stop! the tree can\'t hold on\nnot all its shadow will survive\nthese leaves will shatter, the sun\nin bits onto the ground and the neighbors\nsay they can\'t sleep\nare tired hearing about when I find you\nand it\'s already almost morning.\n\n*\n\nEven on the bottom sand\nno one\'s there to stop my fall\nthe sun must know why\nits needed rest will be its last\n\nalready pulling back\nshaking its head no, sideways\nthen no, all the while downward\n\nmust hear my heart\nwhose constant sparks :each wave\nleads the other back, by night\ntwo more tides\nfalling through the world\n\nmust know why its light stays warm\nleaning against a great wall :the sea\nalmost ashore, a boat suddenly\ntied to the dock, the man\ntracing on a name, the woman\nand sandbars no one\'s noticed before.\n\n*\n\nYou whisper as if this dirt\nweighs nothing and underneath\nthe way darkness sifts for rain\n\nonce the Earth moves alongside\nfondles each footstep\nthat is not evening\n\nin your low voice\nan ancient sky is brought to life\nas still more stars\n\nholding on to one another\nunable to crawl between\nthese two small stones kept together\n\nfor this hillside against your shoulder\nand helpless to lift your face\nin the same breath.\n\n*\n\nAs if this dirt still childlike\nwas something new in the world\nnot yet the powerful side to side\n\nand you could walk slowly uphill\nthe way each breeze is cradled asleep\nyou wrap these stones with a mask\n\nthat is not a grave closer and closer\nthey follow behind one another\ntugging you somewhere that weighs\n\nnothing you don\'t plant anymore\nthough your arms move softly\nas you wait for the stones\n\nand whatever they can still lift\nevery Spring is filled with dirt\nand one hand already hillside\n\neven now you open your arms\nand the emptiness, by instinct, sways\nwith her footsteps facing the others.\n\n*\n\nThough there\'s no boat the rain\nwaits among the waves\nthe way every bridge faces the ocean\n\nthen leaps into rock once water\nused to tides and the stench\nfrom a small stone wearing out\n\nsmoldering, half cinders, half\nas if it was bathing her cheeks\nover and over in this shallow path\n\nremembered only as your shadow\nholding down a single splash\nnothing drifts off, all these years\n\nheading nearer to the bottom, sifting\nbeneath her lips for coastline\nfor seabirds then arms and feet and kisses.\n\n*\n\nBefore there was an evening one arm\nwas already at home as that nightfall\nthese headstones count on for balance\n\ngrasp at the small weight you drop inside\nfrom habit, still splash though oceans\nformed this way before these slabs\n\nare used to it, leaning against the wind\nhalf marble, half that survive\nas another hillside glistening on your arm\n\nkept damp though there\'s no moon nothing\nwill dry all those years falling behind\nin a small sea that won\'t let go.\n\n*\n\nThis twig could just as easily\nbe a hurricane, drained then swept away\nthough it must sense downhill\n\nwith dying wood what you collect\nyou steady between two fingers\nalready sunlight and ashes\n\nand any second now\nthis scrap left for dead\nwill split in half and disbelief\n\na random snap\nas if you had forgotten\nto count backwards, not sure\nonce you reach the emptiness\n\nit will still answer, tell you\nhow to follow behind\nwell after well, filled\n\nwith passageways and slowly\nyou take up the slack, the unfit\nthe shaky wearing out in a circle\n\nhalf sunlight, half chasing off\nthe cold broken open, infected\nwith fires that never recover.\n\n*\n\nIt\'s 3 o\'clock though this table\ncan\'t take it anymore, marooned\nwith nothing on it except a bowl\n\nhalf wood, cold and the lace\nthat no longer covers the window\nyou mop and with one hand\n\ngrasp the other, clear a place\nfor the sea beneath and daylight\nfloating past, kept empty for shells\n\nbroken open as landfall and cobblestones\nall night and the splashing\nthat comes forward, unable to stop\n\nthe bleeding or open your hand\nto let go where the floor ices over\nwhere it widens exhausted, still thirsty.\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
