Burch\n\nThis is a page of the best poems by and about celebrities. I have also included \nsome of the best epigrams, quotes and Tweets by and about celebrities. Many of \nthem are funny, some unintentionally so (for instance, the ones by Sarah Palin).\n\n\nOne of the founding fathers and a major celebrity of his era, Ben Franklin, was a talented coiner of poetic \nepigrams:\n\nLittle strokes \nfell great oaks.\nBen Franklin\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise\nmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\nBen Franklin\n\nAbraham Lincoln was an accomplished poet:\nI range the fields with pensive tread,\nAnd pace the hollow rooms,\nAnd feel (companion of the dead)\nI\'m living in the tombs.\nAbraham Lincoln, My Childhood Home I See Again\n\nYou are young, and I am older;\n You are hopeful, I am not\nEnjoy life, ere it grow colder\n Pluck the roses ere they rot.\nAbraham Lincoln, To Rosa\n\nRonald Reagan was another president who was an accomplished poet. He wrote \nthis poem as a teenager:\n\nThe best part was that I was allowed to dream.\nMany the day I spent deep in a huge rocker\nin the mystic atmosphere\nof Aunt Emma\'s living room\nwith its horsehair-stuffed gargoyles of furniture,\nits shawls and antimacassars,\nglobes of glass over birds and flowers,\nbooks and strange odors;\nmany the day I remained hidden\nin a corner downstairs\nin Uncle Jim\'s jewelry shop\nwith its curious relics,\nfaint lights from gold and silver and bronze,\nlulled by the erratic ticking of a dozen clocks.\n\n\x97Ronald Reagan\n\nSappho of Lesbos was one of the major celebrities of the ancient world. She is \nperhaps the first lesbian we know by name; in fact our modern words lesbian \nand sapphic derive from Lesbos and Sappho. She was quite modern in her \nsensibilities, as this wonderful epigram proves:\n\nA short revealing frock? \nIt\'s just my luck \nyour lips were made to mock! \nSappho, fragment 155, translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nBut she also could pack quite a poetic punch:\n\nEros shakes my soul:\na wind on desolate mountains\nleveling oaks.\nSappho, fragment 42, translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHere are some modern epigrams by people who are justly famous.

He was quite the ladies\' \nman, and also a penner of wise and poetic epigrams:\n\nWhoever set himself up as a judge of Truth is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.Albert Einstein\nThere are two ways to live your life: one is as though nothing is a miracle, the other is as though everything is a miracle.Albert Einstein\nSit next to a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute.

Why, Chanel No. 5, of course!\x97Marilyn \nMonroe\nIt\'s not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on.\x97Marilyn Monroe\nI\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.\x97Marilyn Monroe\nI don\'t mind making jokes, but I don\'t want to look like one.\x97Marilyn Monroe\nIf I\'d observed all the rules I\'d never have gotten anywhere.\x97Marilyn Monroe\nWomen who seek to be equal with men lack ambition.\x97Marilyn Monroe\n\nMen are so willing to respect anything that bores them.\x97Marilyn Monroe\nBefore marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him.

He served hard time in Reading \nGaol for the crime of being flamboyantly gay. He was a talented poet, \nplaywright and often-outrageous wit:\n\nSome cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.Oscar Wilde\nMen always want to be a woman\'s first love; women like to be a man\'s last romance.Oscar Wilde\nQuestions are never indiscreet, answers sometimes are.Oscar Wilde\nScandal is gossip made tedious by morality.Oscar Wilde\nEither that wallpaper goes, or I do.Oscar Wilde, allegedly his dying \nwords\n\nBut not all modern epigrams are gems of wisdom:\n\nRefudiate, misunderestimate, wee-wee\'d up. English is a living language. \nShakespeare liked to coin words, too. Got to celebrate it!@SarahPalinUSA\nIn the process of creating her Shakespearean Tweet, Sarah Palin either \ncreated a second nonsense word or borrowed it from another charismatic moron, \nwhose identity must be concealed to protect the ignorant.

But I \ndon\'t give a Puck.@CroweJam \n\nAnd here\'s a poem of mine that was inspired by Palin\'s wordplay: \npls refudiate!\nby Michael R. Burch\nRefudiate this,\nmiffed, misunderstood Ms!\nShakespeare, youre not\n(more like Yoda, but hot).\nYour grammars atrocious;\nGreat Poets would know this.  \nYou lack any plan\nsave to flatten Iran\nlike some cute Mini-Me\ncloned from G. W. B. \nAdmit it, Ms. Palin!,\nstop your winkin and wailin\nonly heroes like Nero\nfiddle sparks at Ground Zero.\nOr, as Edmund Conti says of America\'s new master communicator:\nSarah Palin likes to bleat\nI am Woman. Hear me tweet.\n\nHere\'s a more serious poem about a celebrity:\n\nPraise Song for the Day\nby Elizabeth Alexander\na poem for Barack Obama\'s presidential inauguration\nEach day we go about our business,\nwalking past each other, catching each other\'s\neyes or not, about to speak or speaking.\nAll about us is noise. All about us is\nnoise and bramble, thorn and din, each\none of our ancestors on our tongues.\nSomeone is stitching up a hem, darning\na hole in a uniform, patching a tire,\nrepairing the things in need of repair.\nSomeone is trying to make music somewhere,\nwith a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum,\nwith cello, boom box, harmonica, voice.\nA woman and her son wait for the bus.\nA farmer considers the changing sky.\nA teacher says, Take out your pencils. Begin.\nWe encounter each other in words, words\nspiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed,\nwords to consider, reconsider.\nWe cross dirt roads and highways that mark\nthe will of some one and then others, who said\nI need to see what\'s on the other side.\nI know there\'s something better down the road.\nWe need to find a place where we are safe.\nWe walk into that which we cannot yet see.\nSay it plain: that many have died for this day.\nSing the names of the dead who brought us here,\nwho laid the train tracks, raised the bridges,\npicked the cotton and the lettuce, built\nbrick by brick the glittering edifices\nthey would then keep clean and work inside of.\nPraise song for struggle, praise song for the day.\nPraise song for every hand-lettered sign,\nthe figuring-it-out at kitchen tables.\nSome live by love thy neighbor as thyself,\nothers by first do no harm or take no more\nthan you need. What if the mightiest word is love?\nLove beyond marital, filial, national,\nlove that casts a widening pool of light,\nlove with no need to pre-empt grievance.\nIn today\'s sharp sparkle, this winter air,\nany thing can be made, any sentence begun.\nOn the brink, on the brim, on the cusp,\npraise song for walking forward in that light.\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
