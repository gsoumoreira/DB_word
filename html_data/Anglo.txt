(There is a link to my \r\ntranslations of the poem at the bottom of this page.) One thing led to another, \r\nand I began to translate other poems from the same same collection.\r\nThere are around 100 riddles and kennings in the Exeter Book, the oldest \r\nsurviving poetry anthology in the English language. However, the exact number is unknown \r\nbecause some pages are illegible or missing. Unfortunately, from the \r\ngouges and round stains on the cover, it appears \r\nthis precious book was used as a cutting board and coaster for beer mugs! \r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe poems \r\nof the Exeter Book were written in Anglo-Saxon Englishalso known as \r\nOld Englishand thus exhibit a heavy Germanic influence. \r\n(The Angles, from which England derives its name, were a Germanic tribe, as were \r\nthe Saxons and Jutes.) While these poems are \r\noften grouped together and called riddles collectively, some of them are actually kennings, \r\nor extended metaphors. Anglo-Saxon scops frequently employed two-word kennings: \r\nalliterative metaphors like whale-way for the sea, sea-steeds for ships, \r\ntickle-tools for feathers, and mead-making for drunken, rambling speech. \r\nWhen Anglo-Saxon scops constructed poems, they sometimes extended such kennings into \r\nlarger, more elaborate constructions such as gr\xe1r nagr hr\xe6va (the grey \r\nbird of corpses) and \xfej\xf3\xf0 m\xe1na stiettar (the people of the moon\'s \r\npath). My favorite kenning is wordhord \r\n(word-hoard), a metaphor for a poet\'s vocabulary. In some cases, metaphors were \r\nextended into poems of considerable length and complexity, anticipating the work \r\nof metaphysical poets to come several centuries later, such as John Donne, \r\nAndrew Marvell, George Herbert and Henry Vaughan. Modern examples of extended \r\nmetaphors include Donne\'s holy sonnets, Marvell\'s famous carpe diem poem To His \r\nCoy Mistress, and Herbert\'s devotional poems The Collar and The Pulley. The ancient \r\nAnglo-Saxon scops tended to be less sophisticated than their poetic descendents; they \r\nwere coarser, lewder and often wickedly funny! The scops were to the metaphysical poets \r\nas Andrew Dice Clay is to Jerry Seinfeld, or Meatloaf to the Three Tenors. \r\n\r\nKenning definition: a compound expression with a metaphorical \r\nmeaning.\r\nKenning examples: word-hoard (vocabulary), oar-steed \r\n(ship), sea-steed (ship), whale-road (sea), whale-way (sea), \r\ntickle-tools (feathers)\r\nKenning etymology: Old Norsekennato know, perceive \r\n(related to the Scottish ken, to know and the German kennen \r\nto know, be acquainted with)\r\n\r\nRiddle definition: a question or statement intentionally \r\nphrased to require ingenuity in ascertaining its answer or meaning, typically \r\npresented as a game or challenge.\r\nRiddle examples: What is so delicate that saying its name \r\nbreaks it? (Answer: Silence) What has four eyes but can\x92t see? (Answer: \r\nMississippi) \r\nRiddle etymology: Old English rdels, rdelse \r\nopinion, conjecture, riddle (related to the Dutch raadsel and the \r\nGerman R\xe4tsel) \r\n\r\nRiddle history:\r\nRiddles have been around forever. The oldest extant epic poem, Gilgamesh, \r\ncontains a riddle: the Riddle of the Springs of Dilmun. Perhaps the \r\nmost famous \r\nancient riddle is the Riddle of the Sphinx in the Greek play \r\nOedipus. In the Hebrew Bible, the Queen of Sheba asked King Solomon a \r\nriddle, which the wisest of men was able to solve. Also in the Bible, the strongman Samson \r\nperplexed his friends with a riddle, which they were unable to solve. In J. R. R. Tolkien\'s The \r\nHobbit, Bilbo Baggins and Gollum engaged in a riddle contest, which allowed \r\nBaggins to escape with his life and the One Ring (although Bilbo may have cheated when he asked Gollum what he had in his pocket!). One of the \r\nmost famous comic book super-villains is Batman\'s nemesis, the Riddler: Riddle me this / \r\nRiddle me that / Who\'s afraid of the big, black Bat? \r\n\r\nKenning history: Kennings are also ancient, but apparently \r\nstarted further north because some of the oldest kennings appear in the work of \r\nthe skalds, or Norse poets. Such kennings appear to be closely related to \r\nAnglo-Saxon kennings. For instance, the kenning sea-steed for ship appears \r\nin both Norse and Anglo-Saxon poetry. Extended kennings of up to seven elements \r\ncan be found in skaldic verse. One of my favorite Norse kennings is winter-ewde(winter-raiment \r\nor snow). \r\n\r\nThe Difference Between Riddles and Kennings: The Anglo-Saxon scops were \r\naccomplished riddlers and kenners. For my purposes here, a riddle asks the \r\nquestion: Who or what am I? A kenning, on the other hand, is an extended \r\nmetaphor that helps us better understand something named or known. But sometimes \r\nthe lines blur, because when we finish a riddle, if we are able to solve it, we \r\nmay well understand the subject better! \r\n\r\nHere is one of the shorter Anglo-Saxon riddles:\r\n\r\nRiddle: Water Become Bone\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWonder-wrought waves: water become bone!\r\n\r\n(Solution: Ice on a frozen lake or seashore.)\r\n\r\nI call my translations loose translations because rather than trying to \r\nreproduce each ancient word literally, losing much of the poetry in the process, \r\nI try to ken what the original poet was thinking and feeling, then turn those \r\nfeelings and thoughts into modern English. Whether I have succeeded or \r\nnot is mostly up to you, the reader, since no one can inquire with the original \r\nauthors. But I think my translation above does capture something of the spirit of \r\nthe original poem: the magic of translucent liquid water somehow becoming solid \r\nand white, like bone. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Online Etymology Dictionary, our word kenning derives from \r\nthe Old Norse cognate verb kenna: to know, to recognize, to feel or \r\nperceive; to call, to name (in a formal poetic metaphor). So a kenning helps us \r\nknow something more fully by the way it is named: whale-way, sea-steed, \r\ntickle-tool, mead-making, etc. According to the Bible, the first act of the \r\nfirst man, Adam, was to name things. And if we want to avoid the fate of the \r\npeople who built the Tower of Babel, we need to heed the advice of the wisest of \r\nthe ancient Greeks, Socrates, and agree on the meanings of the words we use. \r\nPoetic kennings are one way of grasping such meanings more intimately and \r\nprofoundly. I am reminded of the word grok used by the Mars-born visitor to \r\nearth in Robert Heinlein\'s novel A Stranger in \r\na Strange Land. I think to grok and to ken are \r\nessentially the same: to know \r\nand understand something as fully as possible. \r\n\r\nKennings were so popular in Anglo-Saxon poetry that around a third of Beowulf, \r\nthe best-known Anglo-Saxon poem, is comprised of kennings. And Beowulf is \r\nitself a kenning, meaning bee-wolf, or bear (bears are famous for \r\nrobbing bees of their honey). Why did the scops use primarily alliterative \r\nkennings? Because the primary sound-device of Anglo-Saxon poetry was \r\nalliteration, the repetition of letter sounds. For example, the short poem above \r\ncontains four w sounds and two b sounds. Also the words wonder and water \r\nsound very similar, as do become and bone. So there can be a lot going on, \r\nsonically, in a line of Anglo-Saxon poetry, even though such poetry rarely \r\nemploys rhyme. \r\n\r\nThe Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings, Icelanders and Teutons had a rich \r\nriddle-poem tradition, known as enigmata (think enigma). During the Dark Ages, people of these \r\ncultures frequently played riddle games around hearth-fires, while drinking beer, \r\nale, mead and other inebriating beverages. So the fun was often quite \r\nboisterous, and sometimes obscene. For instance, some of the riddles and \r\nkennings compare things that are hard and swell to men\'s penises. (The word \r\nthing itself can refer to a penis.) Thanks to the Exeter Book, a good number of these poems have survived. However, the \r\ncompounding of kennings sometimes resulted in cumbersome confusion, so not all such poems \r\nare successful. On this page, I have selected some of the better short poems \r\nthat in my opinion still hit on all cylinders.\r\n\r\nBy way of example, here is a wonderfully humorous and ironic kenning, in which the \r\nidentity of the protagonist is revealed immediately, meaning that the poem is \r\nnot really a riddle in the modern sense of the word:\r\n\r\nKenning: A Moth Devoured Words\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA moth devoured words!\r\nWhen I heard about this horrific theft,\r\nI thought it passing strange\r\nthat an insect can feast on a man\'s finest song,\r\ngorge on his grandiloquence,\r\nriddle his most righteous rhetoric.\r\nBut then I realized: the wee bookworm\r\nwandered away not one whit the wiser!\r\n\r\n(Kenning: A moth is not fooled or impressed by man\'s rhetoric. Nor is \r\nthere anything to be learned in foppish nonsense, even by the smallest of \r\nbookworms.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the Old English word scop \r\nis related to our modern word scoff through the Old High Germanscoph(poetry, \r\nsport, jest) and the Old Norseskop(railing, mockery). Were\r\nthe scops scoffers? The clever satire above suggests so. The ancient \r\nCeltic bards were such accomplished satirists that it was said that even kings \r\nfeared their mockeries! \r\n\r\nThe Exeter Book was a handwritten manuscript bequeathed to the Exeter Cathedral Library by a bishop named Leofric \r\nwho died in 1072 A.D., so the book is ancient. Experts have dated the book itself it \r\nto around 970 to 990 A.D., but some of the poems could be much older, having \r\nbeen passed down orally before they were written down.\r\n\r\nLeofric must have been somewhat tolerant, because some of the poems are slyly \r\nlewd and fall into the category of double entendre. Here\'s one with an \r\ninteresting twist:\r\n\r\nRiddle: The Curious Creature\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI\'m a curious creature;\r\nI satisfy women, and sometimes their neighbors!\r\n(After a brief period of anticipation,\r\nin which I offer them hope of pleasures to come.)\r\nNo one suffers because of me, except my slayer.\r\nI grow erect in bed.\r\nI\'m hairy underneath.\r\nSometimes a beautiful girl,\r\nthe brave daughter of some commoner\r\nwho\'s not above my low station\r\ngrabs me eagerly,\r\nmanipulates my russet skin,\r\nholds me hard,\r\ncleanses my head,\r\nthen keeps me handy, nearby.\r\nBut the girl who keeps me confined\r\nwill soon feel the effects:\r\nI make her wet.\r\n\r\nThe poem above is obviously about an onion, but it makes a series of comparisons to a \r\nman\'s penis. An onion makes a cook\'s eyes water, so \r\nthe scop drew a clever, provocative parallel in the closing lines. \r\n\r\nHere\'s a similar riddle:\r\n\r\nRiddle: A Curious Thing Hangs\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA curious thing hangs,\r\ndangles by a man\'s thigh,\r\ncovered by his clothes.\r\nIt has an eye in its head;\r\nit\'s stiff and hard;\r\nand because it\'s borne firmly it yields a reward.\r\nThe man pulls his clothes above his knee,\r\nin order to poke the head of his hanging thing\r\ninto that old familiar hole it fits so well,\r\nand has filled so many times before.\r\n\r\n(Solution: A key worn secretly inside a man\'s clothes, perhaps a priest\'s robe. \r\nIf so, the poem could poke fun at the clergy, who were supposed to be celibate \r\nbut often had mistresses.)\r\n\r\nHere\'s another poem in a similar vein:\r\n\r\nRiddle: The Swollen Thing\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI heard there\'s something growing in its nook,\r\nswelling, rising, and expanding,\r\npushing against its covering.\r\nI heard a cocky-minded young woman took that boneless thing in her hands,\r\ncovered its tumescence with a soft cloth.\r\n\r\n(Solution: Dough rising.)\r\n\r\nRiddle: I Watched Two Wondrous Creatures\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI watched a wondrous creature, a bright unicorn,\r\nbearing away treasure between her white horns,\r\nfetching it home from some distant adventure.\r\nI\'m sure she intended to hide her loot in some lofty stronghold\r\nconstructed with incredible cunning, her craft.\r\nBut then climbing the sky-cliffs a far greater creature arose,\r\nher fiery face familiar to all earth\'s inhabitants.\r\nShe seized all the spoils, driving the albescent creature\r\nwith her wrecked dreams far to the west,\r\nspewing wild insults as she scurried home.\r\nDust rose heavenward. Dew descended.\r\nNight fled, and afterward\r\nNo man knew where the white creature went.\r\n\r\n(Solution: The sun and the moon.)\r\n\r\nKenning: The Whale\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow, I will sing about this strange fishes\' kin,\r\nfinned like no flounder, and no friend to men:\r\nThe mighty Leviathan.\r\n\r\nHe floats in the ocean like a regal rock;\r\nmen mistake him for an island; some try to dock,\r\nseldom with any luck.\r\n\r\nBut if they make land, securing their ship\r\nwith great, heavy ropes from which green seaweed drips,\r\nhe soon dives to the bottom, taking them for a dip!\r\n\r\nThe whale is a demon, the siren of the seas;\r\nhe lures men and fish with his fragrant ambergris\r\ninto his dark gullet, ignoring their pleas!\r\n\r\nHis father, the Devil, does the same thing as well:\r\noffers comfort and haven when wild tempests swell,\r\nthen drags dull men down to the darkest depths of hell.\r\n\r\n(Kenning: The Whale is like his father, the Devil, in tactics, and many \r\nunwitting men are their victims.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the Anglo-Saxon language was Germanic in its origins, around a third of its \r\nwords are preserved in modern English, so the two languages remain closely related. \r\nIn the poem below, words like suck and suckle and sea come to us from our \r\nAnglo-Saxon ancestors, while slurp is closely related, deriving from the Middle \r\nDutch slurpen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRiddle: The Sea Suckled Me\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe sea suckled me; the wild waves washed me;\r\nI was rocked by breakers in my restless cradle.\r\nFootless but fixed, I opened my wordless mouth to the life-giving floods.\r\nBut soon some man will come to consume me,\r\nslip the point of his knife savagely into my side,\r\nslide it down, ripping the flesh from my bones,\r\nthen slurp me in raw, smiling as he sucks me down.\r\n\r\n(Solution: An Oyster.)\r\n\r\nRiddle: A Female Brooding\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI saw a female, solitary, brooding.\r\n\r\n(Solution: A hen, and perhaps a human woman left to bear and raise her children \r\nalone, because some cocky rooster refused to accept his responsibility as their \r\nfather.)\r\n\r\nI hope you have enjoyed my translations from the dawn of the English language. \r\nAlthough our Anglo-Saxon ancestors lived in very difficult times, experiencing \r\nplagues, the wild injustices of church and state, and being attacked by fearsome \r\nNorsemen and other invaders, they managed to keep their wits about themselves, \r\nand their sense of humor, however dark at times. And I think we can still see \r\nthat dark humor in ourselves: in the humorous writings of Mark Twain, in the \r\ncomedy of George Carlin, in political cartoons, and in sitcoms like Married \r\nWith Children. \r\n\r\nHere is a somewhat more modern English riddle-poem that may have been influenced \r\nby the older Anglo-Saxon scops and their riddle-poems:\r\n\r\nI Have a Yong Suster (Anonymous Medieval English Riddle-Poem, circa 1430)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nI have a yong suster I have a young sister\r\nFer biyonde the see; Far beyond the sea;\r\nManye be the druries Many are the keepsakes\r\nThat she sente me. That she sent me. \r\nShe sente me the cherye She sent me the cherry\r\nWithouten any stoon, \r\nWithout any stone;\r\nAnd so she dide the dove And also the dove\r\nWithouten any boon. Without any bone. \r\nShe sente me the brere She sent me the briar\r\nWithouten any rinde; Without any skin;\r\nShe bad me love my lemman She bade me love my lover\r\nWithoute longinge. Without longing. \r\nHow sholde any cherye How should any cherry\r\nBe withoute stoon? Be without a stone?\r\nAnd how sholde any dove And how should any dove\r\nBe withoute boon? Be without a bone? \r\nHow sholde any brere How should any briar\r\nBe withoute rinde? Be without a skin?\r\nHow sholde I love my lemman \r\nAnd how should I love my lover\r\nWithoute longinge? Without longing? \r\nWhan the cherye was a flowr, When the cherry was a flower,\r\nThanne hadde it no stoon; Then it had no stone;\r\nWhan the dove was an ey, When the dove was an egg,\r\nThanne hadde it no boon. Then it had no bone. \r\nWhan the brere was unbred, When the briar was unborn,\r\nThanne hadde it no rinde; Then it had no skin;\r\nWhan the maiden hath that she loveth, And when a maiden has her mate,\r\nShe is withoute longinge. She is without longing!\r\n\r\nThat is a wickedly funny ending! \r\n\r\nThe following are links to other translations by Michael R. Burch. Wulf \r\nand Eadwacer may be the oldest extant poem in the English language written \r\nby a female poet. Sweet Rose of Virtue is a modern translation of a truly \r\ngreat poem by the early Scottish master William Dunbar. How Long the Night is \r\none of the very best Anglo Saxon lyric poems.
