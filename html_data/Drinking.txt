Of course wine doesn\'t grow on the vine! Otherwise, it\'s a \r\nlovely, touching song about growing up and feeling the heat of young love. \r\nMy favorite line from a drinking song is: Will they have Mogen David in heaven, \r\nsweet Jesus? If they don\'t, who the hell wants to go? Who indeed? \r\n\r\nHonorable Mention:\r\nLines on Ale by Edgar Allan Poe, There\x92s a Tear in My Beer by Hank Williams Sr., Family Tradition by Hank Williams Jr.,\r\nAll My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight by Hank Williams Jr., \r\nIf Drinking Don\x92t Kill Me (Her Memory Will) by George Jones, I Think I\x92ll \r\nJust Stay Here and Drink by Merle Haggard, Alabama Song (aka Alabama Whisky \r\nBar) by Jim Morrison and the Doors,\r\nTubthumping by Chumbawamba, Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg, Brass \r\nMonkey by the Beastie Boys,\r\nDoh, Re, Me by Homer Simpson,\r\nNinety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall by Anonymous (an early 20th century \r\nAmerican folk song of uncertain origins), The Boys Are Back in Town by Thin \r\nLizzy,\r\nEscape (aka The Pi\xf1a Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes\r\n\r\nTop Ten Poems about Drinking\r\n\r\nSong to Celia (Drink to me only with thine eyes) by Ben Jonson\r\nTerence, this is stupid stuff by A.

E. Housman\r\n\r\nSong of The Alleycat\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nO give me a bottle\r\nAnd let me forget\r\nAll of this struggle \r\nAnd passion to get;\r\n\r\nPresume no desire\r\nTo pull in the fight;\r\nO give me a bottle,\r\nAnd bid me goodnight.\r\n\r\nAubade\r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nI work all day, and get half-drunk at night.\r\nWaking at four to soundless dark, I stare.\r\nIn time the curtain-edges will grow light.\r\nTill then I see what\x92s really always there:\r\nUnresting death, a whole day nearer now,\r\nMaking all thought impossible but how\r\nAnd where and when I shall myself die.\r\nArid interrogation: yet the dread\r\nOf dying, and being dead,\r\nFlashes afresh to hold and horrify. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbide\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nafter Philip Larkin\'s Aubade\r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand or accept mortality\r\nsuch an alien concept:not to be.\r\nPerhaps unsettling enough to spawn religion,\r\nor to scare mutant fish out of a primordial sea\r\n\r\nboiling like goopy green tea in a kettle.\r\nPerhaps a man should exhibit more mettle\r\nthan to admit such fear, denying Nirvana exists\r\nsimply because we are stuck here in such a fine fettle.\r\n\r\nAnd so we abide . . .\r\neven in life, staring out across that dark brink.\r\nAnd if the thought of death makes your questioning heart sink,\r\nit is best not to drink\r\n(or, drinking, certainly not to think).\r\n\r\nA Drinking Song\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWine comes in at the mouth\r\nAnd love comes in at the eye;\r\nThat\x92s all we shall know for truth\r\nBefore we grow old and die.\r\nI lift the glass to my mouth,\r\nI look at you, and I sigh.\r\n\r\nA statesman is an easy man, he tells his lies by rote.\r\nA journalist invents his lies, and rams them down your throat.\r\nSo stay at home and drink your beer and let the neighbors vote.\r\n\x97An excerpt from The Old Stone Cross by W. B.

Born in Zhangqiu into a \r\nfamily of scholars, Qingzhao was unusually outgoing and knowledgeable of a woman \r\nof noble birth. Before she got married, her poetry was already well known within \r\nelite circles. Marrying Zhao Mingcheng in 1811, his absences for work fuelled a \r\nlot of her poetry, which is often imbued with yearning and explores the effects \r\nof wine on her thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nLight mists and heavy clouds,\r\nmelancholy the long dreary day;\r\nIn the golden censer\r\nthe burning incense is dying away.\r\nIt is again time\r\nfor the lovely Double-Night Festival;\r\nThe coolness of midnight\r\npenetrates my screen of sheer silk\r\nand chills my pillow of jade.\r\nAfter drinking wine at twilight\r\nunder the chrysanthemum hedge,\r\nMy sleeves are perfumed\r\nby the faint fragrance of the plants.\r\nOh, I cannot say it is not enchanting,\r\nOnly, when the west wind stirs the curtain,\r\nI see that I am more graceful\r\nthan the yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nLi Qingzhao\r\n\r\nJohn Barleycorn\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\nThere was three kings into the east,\r\nThree kings both great and high,\r\nAnd they hae sworn a solemn oath\r\nJohn Barleycorn should die.\r\n\r\nThey took a plough and plough\x92d him down,\r\nPut clods upon his head,\r\nAnd they hae sworn a solemn oath\r\nJohn Barleycorn was dead.\r\n\r\nBut the cheerful Spring came kindly on,\r\nAnd show\x92rs began to fall;\r\nJohn Barleycorn got up again,\r\nAnd sore surpris\x92d them all.\r\n\r\nThe sultry suns of Summer came,\r\nAnd he grew thick and strong;\r\nHis head weel arm\x92d wi\x92 pointed spears,\r\nThat no one should him wrong.\r\n\r\nThe sober Autumn enter\x92d mild,\r\nWhen he grew wan and pale;\r\nHis bending joints and drooping head\r\nShow\x92d he began to fail.\r\n\r\nHis colour sicken\x92d more and more,\r\nHe faded into age;\r\nAnd then his enemies began\r\nTo show their deadly rage.\r\n\r\nThey\x92ve taen a weapon, long and sharp,\r\nAnd cut him by the knee;\r\nThen tied him fast upon a cart,\r\nLike a rogue for forgerie.\r\n\r\nThey laid him down upon his back,\r\nAnd cudgell\x92d him full sore;\r\nThey hung him up before the storm,\r\nAnd turned him o\x92er and o\x92er.\r\n\r\nThey filled up a darksome pit\r\nWith water to the brim;\r\nThey heaved in John Barleycorn,\r\nThere let him sink or swim.\r\n\r\nThey laid him out upon the floor,\r\nTo work him farther woe;\r\nAnd still, as signs of life appear\x92d,\r\nThey toss\x92d him to and fro.\r\n\r\nThey wasted, o\x92er a scorching flame,\r\nThe marrow of his bones;\r\nBut a miller us\x92d him worst of all,\r\nFor he crush\x92d him between two stones.\r\n\r\nAnd they hae taen his very heart\x92s blood,\r\nAnd drank it round and round;\r\nAnd still the more and more they drank,\r\nTheir joy did more abound.\r\n\r\nJohn Barleycorn was a hero bold,\r\nOf noble enterprise;\r\nFor if you do but taste his blood,\r\n\x91Twill make your courage rise.\r\n\r\n\x91Twill make a man forget his woe;\r\n\x91Twill heighten all his joy;\r\n\x91Twill make the widow\x92s heart to sing,\r\nTho\x92 the tear were in her eye.\r\n\r\nThen let us toast John Barleycorn,\r\nEach man a glass in hand;\r\nAnd may his great posterity\r\nNe\x92er fail in old Scotland!\r\n\r\nAmerican poet, literary critic and travel writer Bayard Taylor was born to \r\nQuaker parents in Pennsylvania in 1825. He published his first anthology aged 19 \r\nin 1844, using the money he made from the book to fund his travels around \r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nI\x92ve drunk Sicilia\x92s crimson wine!\r\nThe blazing vintage pressed\r\nFrom grapes on Etna\x92s breast,\r\nWhat time the mellowing autumn sun did shine:\r\nI\x91ve drunk the wine!\r\nI feel its blood divine\r\nPoured on the sluggish tide of mine,\r\nTill, kindling slow, Its fountains glow\r\nWith the light that swims\r\nOn their trembling brims,\r\nAnd a molten sunrise floods my limbs!\r\n\r\nDivine Apollo!\r\nThen thou thy lute shalt twine\r\nWith Bacchic tendrils of the glorious vine\r\nThat gave Sicilian wine:\r\nAnd henceforth when the breezes run\r\nOver its clusters, ripening in the sun,\r\nThe leaves shall still be playing,\r\nUnto thy lute its melody repaying,\r\nAnd I, that quaff, shall evermore be free\r\nTo mount thy car and ride the heavens with thee!\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor\r\n\r\nBorn in China in 701, Li Bai is regarded as a pivotal figure in the Chinese \r\npoetry of the mid-Tang dynasty, which is often referred to as the Golden Age of \r\nChina. During his lifetime, Bai wrote over 1,000 poems, many of which celebrate \r\nwine, song and friendship. Legend has it that Bai drowned when he reached from \r\nhis boat in a bid to grasp the moon\x92s reflection in the river.\r\n\r\nIf heaven loved not the wine,\r\nA Wine Star would not be in heaven;\r\nIf earth loved not the wine,\r\nThe Wine Spring would not be on the earth.\r\nSince heaven and earth love the wine,\r\nNeed a tippling mortal be ashamed?\r\nThe transparent wine, I hear,\r\nHas the soothing virtue of a sage,\r\nWhile the turgid is rich, they say,\r\nAs the fertile mind of the wise.\r\nBoth the sage and the wise were drinkers,\r\nWhy seek for peers among gods and goblins?\r\nThree cups open the grand door to bliss;\r\nTake a jugful, the universe is yours.\r\nSuch is the rapture of the wine,\r\nThat the sober shall never inherit.\r\n\r\nLi Bai\r\n\r\nEnglish poet, playwright and literary critic Ben Jonson is best known for his \r\nsatirical plays and is generally regarded as the second most important English \r\ndramatist after William Shakespeare. Educated at Cambridge, Jonson\x92s poetry is \r\ninformed by his classical learning.\r\n\r\nSong to Celia\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\nDrink to me only with thine eyes,\r\nAnd I will pledge with mine;\r\nOr leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\nAnd I\x92ll not look for wine.\r\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise,\r\nDoth ask a drink divine;\r\nBut might I of Jove\x92s nectar sip,\r\nI would not change for thine.\r\n\r\nI sent thee, late, a rosy wreath,\r\nNot so much honouring thee,\r\nAs giving it a hope,\r\nthat there It could not withered be:\r\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe,\r\nAnd sent\x92st it back to me;\r\nSince when, it grows and smells,\r\nI swear, not of itself, but thee!\r\n\r\nThe Soul of Wine\r\nby Charles Baudelaire\r\n\r\nOne eve in the bottle sang the soul of wine:\r\n\x94Man, unto thee, dear disinherited,\r\nI sing a song of love and light divine\r\nPrisoned in glass beneath my seals of red.\r\n\x93I know thou labourest on the hill of fire,\r\nIn sweat and pain beneath a flaming sun,\r\nTo give the life and souls my vines desire,\r\nAnd I am grateful for thy labours done.\r\nFor I find joys unnumbered when I lave\r\nThe throat of man by travail long outworn,\r\nAnd his hot bosom is a sweeter grave\r\nOf sounder sleep than my cold caves forlorn.\r\n\x93Hearest thou not the echoing Sabbath sound?\r\nThe hope that whispers in my trembling breast?\r\nThy elbows on the table! gaze around;\r\nGlorify me with joy and be at rest.\r\n\x93To thy wife\x92s eyes I\x92ll bring their long-lost gleam,\r\nI\x92ll bring back to thy child his strength and light,\r\nTo him, life\x92s fragile athlete I will seem\r\nRare oil that firms his muscle for the fight.\r\n\x93I flow in man\x92s heart as ambrosia flows;\r\nThe grain the eternal Sower casts in the sod\r\nFrom our first loves the first fair verse arose,\r\nFlower-like aspiring to the heavens and God!\x94\r\n\r\nOde to Wine\r\nby Pablo Neruda\r\n\r\nWine color of day\r\nwine color of night\r\nwine with your feet of purple\r\nor topaz blood,\r\nwine,\r\nstarry child of the earth,\r\nwine, smooth as a golden sword,\r\nsoft as ruffled velvet,\r\nwine spiral-shelled and suspended,\r\nloving, of the sea,\r\nyou\x92ve never been contained in one glass,\r\nin one song, in one man,\r\nchoral, you are gregarious\r\nand, at least, mutual.\r\nmemories on your wave\r\nwe go from tomb to tomb,\r\nstonecutter of icy graves,\r\nand we weep transitory tears,\r\nbut your beautiful spring suit is different,\r\nthe heart climbs to the branches,\r\nthe wind moves the day,\r\nnothing remains in your motionless soul.\r\nWine stirs the spring,\r\njoy grows like a plant,\r\nwalls, large rocks fall,\r\nabysses close up, song is born.\r\nOh thou, jug of wine, in the desert\r\nwith the woman I love,\r\nsaid the old poet.\r\nLet the pitcher of wine and its kiss to the kiss of love.\r\n\r\nMy love, suddenly,\r\nyour hip\r\nis the curve of the wineglass\r\nfilled to the brim,\r\nyour breast is the cluster,\r\nyour hair the light of alcohol\r\nyour nipples, the grapes\r\nyour navel pure seal stamped on your belly of a barrel,\r\nand your love the cascade of unquenchable wine,\r\nthe brightness that falls on my sense\r\nthe earthen splendor of life.\r\n\r\nBut not only love,\r\nburning kiss,\r\nof ignited heart-\r\nvino de vida, you are also\r\nfellowship, transparency,\r\nchorus of discipline abundance of flowers.\r\nI love the light of a bottle of intelligent wine\r\nupon a table\r\nwhen people are talking,\r\nthat they drink it,\r\nthat in each drop of gold\r\nor ladle of purple,\r\nthey remember that autumn worked\r\nuntil the barrels were filled with wine\r\nand let the obscure man learn,\r\nin the ceremony of his business,\r\nto remember the earth and his duties,\r\nto propagate the canticle of the fruit.\r\n\r\nA man of many talents, Persian poet, philosopher, astronomer and mathematician \r\nOmar Khayyam is thought to have written over a thousand four-line verses known \r\nas Rubaiyat, which were translated into English by Edward Fitzgerald in the \r\nmid-19th century. Wine features prominently in Khayyam\x92s poetry, with the \r\nenclosed stanzas offering a snapshot into his relationship with the drink, which \r\nhe saw as a life force to be enjoyed during our brief time on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd David\x92s lips are locket; but in divine\r\nHigh-piping Pehlevi, with \x93Wine! Wine! Wine!\r\nRed Wine!\x94 the Nightingale cries to the Rose\r\nThat sallow cheek of hers t\x92 incarnadine.\r\n\r\nCome, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring\r\nYour Winter-garment of Repentance fling:\r\nThe Bird of Time has but a little way\r\nTo flutter\x96and the Bird is on the Wing.\r\n\r\nWhether at Naishapur or Babylon,\r\nWhether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,\r\nThe Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,\r\nThe Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.\r\n\r\nThen to the lip of this poor earthen Urn\r\nI lean\x92d, the Secret of my Life to learn:\r\nAnd Lip to Lip it murmur\x92d\x96\x93While you live\r\nDrink!\x96for, once dead, you never shall return.\x94\r\n\r\nPerplext no more with Human or Divine,\r\nTo-morrow\x92s tangle to the winds resign,\r\nAnd lose your fingers in the tresses of\r\nThe Cypress\x96slender Minister of Wine.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press\r\nEnd in what All begins and ends in\x96Yes;\r\nThink then you are To-day what Yesterday\r\nYou were\x96To-morrow You shall not be less.\r\n\r\nSo when that Angel of the darker\r\nDrink\r\nAt last shall find you by the river-brink,\r\nAnd, offering his Cup, invite your\r\nSoul Forth to your Lips to quaff\x96you shall not shrink.\r\n\r\nFor \x93Is\x94 and \x93Is-not\x94 though with Rule and Line\r\nAnd \x93Up\x94 and \x93Down\x94 by Logic I define,\r\nOf all that one should care to fathom,\r\nWas never deep in anything but\x96Wine.\r\n\r\nAnd lately, by the Tavern Door agape,\r\nCame shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape\r\nBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and\r\nHe bid me taste of it; and \x92twas\x96the Grape!\r\n\r\nThe Grape that can with Logic absolute\r\nThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:\r\nThe sovereign Alchemist that in a trice\r\nLife\x92s leaden metal into Gold transmute.\r\nOmar Khayyam\r\n\r\nDrinking Song\r\nby\r\nJ. K. Stephen\r\n\r\nThere are people, I know, to be found,\r\nWho say, and apparently think,\r\nThat sorrow and care may be drowned\r\nBy a timely consumption of drink.\r\n\r\nDoes not man, these enthusiasts ask,\r\nMost nearly approach the divine,\r\nWhen engaged in the soul-stirring task\r\nOf filling his body with wine?\r\n\r\nHave not beggars been frequently known,\r\nWhen satisfied, soaked, and replete,\r\nTo imagine their bench was a throne\r\nAnd the civilised world at their feet?\r\n\r\nLord Byron has finely described\r\nThe remarkably soothing effect\r\nOf liquor, profusely imbibed,\r\nOn a soul that is shattered and wrecked.\r\n\r\nIn short, if your body or mind\r\nOr your soul or your purse come to grief,\r\nYou need only get drunk, and you\'ll find\r\nComplete and immediate relief.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have managed to do\r\nWithout a recourse to this plan,\r\nSo I can\'t write a poem for you,\r\nAAnd you\'d better get someone who can.\r\n\r\nThe Pelagian Drinking Song\r\nby Hilaire Belloc\r\n\r\nPelagius lived at Kardanoel\r\nAnd taught a doctrine there\r\nHow, whether you went to heaven or to hell\r\nIt was your own affair.\r\nIt had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,\r\nBut was your own affair.\r\n\r\nNo, he didn\'t believe\r\nIn Adam and Eve\r\nHe put no faith therein!\r\nHis doubts began\r\nWith the Fall of Man\r\nAnd he laughed at Original Sin.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nHe laughed at original sin.\r\n\r\nThen came the bishop of old Auxerre\r\nGermanus was his name\r\nHe tore great handfuls out of his hair\r\nAnd he called Pelagius shame.\r\nAnd with his stout Episcopal staff\r\nSo thoroughly whacked and banged\r\nThe heretics all, both short and tall --\r\nThey rather had been hanged.\r\n\r\nOh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long\r\nUpon each and all occasions\r\nTill they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\n\r\nNow the faith is old and the Devil bold\r\nExceedingly bold indeed.\r\nAnd the masses of doubt that are floating about\r\nWould smother a mortal creed.\r\nBut we that sit in a sturdy youth\r\nAnd still can drink strong ale\r\nLet us put it away to infallible truth\r\nThat always shall prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd thank the Lord\r\nFor the temporal sword\r\nAnd howling heretics too.\r\nAnd all good things\r\nOur Christendom brings\r\nBut especially barley brew!\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nEspecially barley brew!\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
