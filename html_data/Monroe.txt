Did she write real poetry, really? If so, which \nwere her best poems, and how good was she? This page contains a collection of \nthe \npoems, epigrams, quotations and philosophical writings of Marilyn Monroe, who \nwas also known as Norma Jeane Mortenson (her birth name), Norma Jeane Baker \n(when she used her mother\'s maiden name), Jean Norman (her first modeling name) \nand Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first married name). You can judge for \nyourself, but in my opinion she was a talented poet, philosopher, epigrammatist, humorist and  \nironist. Most of her poems are fairly brief free verse compositions, but she \nalso employed \nend rhyme from time to time. She was a lyric poet, usually starting in media \nres (in the middle of things), without preamble. A number of her poems are confessional in nature, \nwhile others are honest and acute observations about life in general. Some are \nquite touching and moving. This one, for example:\n\nI could have loved you once\nAnd even said it\nBut you went away;\nWhen you came back it was too late\nAnd love was a forgotten word.\nRemember?\n\n\nThere is considerable irony in the poem abovea very \ngentle, sweet, moving irony. I have \nalso included some lovelyand quite poeticphotographs of Marilyn Monroe, \nin which she was caught in \nunguarded moments. One of the picturesthe one in \nwhich she\'s \nlying in bed holding a rosewas her favorite photo of herself. Here is a \npoem in which she uses repetition quite effectively:\n\nThere was my name up in lights. \nI said, God, somebody\'s made a mistake. \nBut \nthere it was, in lights. \nAnd I stood there and said, \nRemember, you\'re not a \nstar. \nYet there it was, up in lights.\n\n \n\nThe small poem above strikes me as a good one. Like many of us, Marilyn \nstruggled with insecurity. Even at the height of her fame and fortune, she may \nnever have felt like a real star. But perhaps there isn\'t any such thing as a \nreal star, and what we call fame is merely a perception, an illusion. I get that impression when I read Marilyn\'s poetry. \n\nHer writings has been collected into a book titled Fragments: Poems, Intimate \nNotes, Letters by Marilyn Monroe. The title makes me think of the first \ngreat lyric poet we know by name, Sappho of Lesbos, because most of Sappho\'s poems have \ncome to us in fragments and also because, like Marilyn, \nSappho is remembered for her sexuality, giving us \nthe terms sapphic and lesbian. Marilyn\'s fragments include poems written in \nnotebooks, in diaries, on loose-leaf paper, and on hotel stationary. The poems \nshow signs of having been revised, such as crossed-out words and insertions. She may have had professional help with those revisions, as she knew some of the \nmajor writers of her day, including her husband the playwright Arthur Miller; \nthe poets Carl Sandburg, Dorothy Parker, Dylan Thomas, Dame Edith Sitwell and \nLouis Untermeyer; and the novelists Truman Capote, Carson McCullers and Saul \nBellow. Marilyn was also an avid reader, with a personal library of over 400 books by \nsuch diverse writers as Aristophanes, Aristotle, Samuel Beckett, William Blake, \nRobert Burns, Albert Camus, Anton Chekhov, Joseph Conrad, Emily \nDickinson,Fyodor Dostoevsky, Albert Einstein, A. E. Housman, Sigmund Freud, Kahlil Gilbran, \nGustave Flaubert, Robinson Jeffers, James Joyce, Jack Kerouac, \nHeinrich Heine, D. H. Lawrence, Federico Garcia Lorca, Lucretius, Thomas Mann, \nKarl Marx, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Plato, Marcel Proust, \nAlexander Pushkin, Francois Rabelais, Rainer Maria Rilke, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde \nand William Butler Yeats. (A comprehensive list of the books she owned appears at \nthe bottom of this page.) \n\nMarilyn Monroe met Dylan Thomas in Shelley Winters\' apartment, circa 1951. She \nbecame friends with Dorothy Parker, who lived nearby her Doheny Drive apartment, \nin 1961. She met Carl Sandburg, spent part of the day with him, and danced with \nhim in 1962. She met Louis Untermeyer through her husband Arthur Miller. \nCarson McCullers befriended Marilyn when she first moved to New York. \nMarilyn read poems by W. B. Yeats aloud at Norman Rosten\'s house. \n\nShe once said, I read poetry to save time. By that, I take her to \nmean that she valued poetry for its compression. A short poem can say a lot, and \nconvey considerable emotion. She also wrote about being simple \nand direct. I believe we can find those virtues in her poems. She was not the \nmost polished of poets, but she was simple, direct and packed quite a punch. And \nshe gets right to the point, in medias res, like the ancient Greek \npoets, so she never wastes our time.\n\nAs Lee Strasberg said in his eloquent eulogy: \x93In her eyes and mine, her career \nwas just beginning. The dream of her talent, which she had nurtured as a child, \nwas not a mirage.\x94 \n\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\nWhat do I wear in bed? Why, Chanel No. 5, of course!\n\n\nIts not too much fun \nto know yourself too well \nor think you do\x97\neveryone needs a little conceit \nto carry them through  past the falls. \n\n\n\n\nI love to do the things the censors won\'t pass.\n\non the screen of pitch blackness comes/reappears \nthe shapes of monsters \nmy most steadfast companions \x85 \nand the world is sleeping\nah peace I need you\x97\neven a peaceful monster\n\n[Analysis: This poem was written after Marilyn Monroe found a diary entry \nby her third husband, the playwright Arthur Miller, in which he said that he was \nsometimes disappointed and embarrassed by her. After reading the entry, she \nfound herself unable to sleep and started taking barbiturates. One of her \ngreatest fears had been disappointing her loved ones.] \n\n\n\nIt\'s often just enough to be with someone. \nI don\'t need to touch them. \nNot even to talk. \nA feeling passes between you both. \nYou\'re not alone. \n\nA career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night. \n\nIn every spring the green [of the ancient maples] is too sharp\x97\nthough the delicacy in their form is sweet and uncertain\x97\nit puts up a good struggle in the wind\x97\ntrembling all the while \x85 \nI think I am very lonely\x97\nmy mind jumps. \nI see myself in the mirror now, brow furrowed\x97\nif I lean close I\x92ll see\x97\nwhat I don\x92t want to know\x97\ntension, sadness, disappointment, \nmy eyes dulled, \ncheeks flushed with capillaries that look like rivers on maps\x97\nhair lying like snakes. \nThe mouth makes me the saddest, next to my dead eyes\x85 \n\n\n\nI believe that everything happens for a reason:\npeople change so that you can \nlearn to let go, \nthings go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, \n\nyou believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, \nand \nsometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.\n\nIt\'s not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the hourglass\ntakes off its dress,\nthe sand loosens and spreads.\nYou cannot find a footing\nin me. They always said\nI was terrible in bed.\n\nWomen who seek to be equal with men lack ambition.\n\n\n\nI guess I have always been\ndeeply terrified at to really be someone\x92s wife\nsince I know from life\none cannot love another,\never, really ...\n\nA wise girl kisses but doesn\'t love, listens but doesn\'t believe, and leaves \nbefore she is left.\n\n\n\nArthur Miller, Monroe\'s third husband, said that she \x93had the instinct and \nreflexes of the poet, but she lacked the control.\x94 Miller was an acclaimed playwright, but \nis it possible that Monroe was the better poet because she didn\'t strive to \ncontrol her words, but let them speak for her simply, directly and honestly? \nSome of the very best poets spoke simply, forthrightly and directly: Basho, \nWilliam Blake, Robert Burns, John Clare, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, A. E. \nHousman, Sappho and Sarah Teasdale, for instance. \n\nI\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I am involved in a freedom ride\nprotesting the loss of the minority rights\nbelonging to the few remaining earthbound stars.\nAll we demanded was our right to twinkle!\n\nHusbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives. \n\n(Was she thinking of JFK when she came up with the epigram above, \nperhaps?)\n\n\n\nFame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, fame.\nIf it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.\nSo at least it\'s something I experienced,\nbut that\'s not where I live.\n\x97Life (New York, Aug. 3, 1962). This was the conclusion of a taped conversation published the day that Monroe died.\n\nI don\'t mind making jokes, but I don\'t want to look like one.\n\n\n\nI believe this:\nYou just do it.\nYou force yourself to get up.\nYou force yourself to put one foot before the other,\nand goddamn it,\nyou refuse to let it get to you.\nYou fight.\nYou cry.\nYou curse.\nThen you go about your business of living.\nThat\'s how I\'ve done it.\nThere\'s no other way.\n\nIf I\'d observed all the rules I\'d never have gotten anywhere.\n\n\n\nO, Time\nBe Kind\nHelp this weary being\nTo forget what is sad to remember ...\nLoose my loneliness,\nEase my mind,\nWhile you eat my flesh.\n\nMen are so willing to respect anything that bores them.\n\n\n\nFrom time to time\nI make it rhyme\nbut don\'t hold that kind\nof thing\nagainst\nme\x97\nOh well, what the hell,\nso it won\'t sell.\nWhat I want to tell\x97\nis what\'s on my mind:\n\'taint Dishes,\n\'taint Wishes,\nit\'s thoughts\nflinging by\nbefore I die\x97\nand to think\nin ink.\n\nBefore marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him.

She was evidently punished, humiliated and threatened with hell by her \ngreat-aunt Ida Martin, a strict, evangelical Christian who was paid to look \nafter Norma Jeane for several months from 1937 to 1938. The picture above the \npoem is Marilyn Monroe\'s favorite photo of herself.]\n\n\nIt\'s all make believe, isn\'t it?\n\nMarilyn not only enjoyed reading poetry but wrote some of her own. Always \nfearful of harsh judgement, Marilyn only showed her\npoetry to a select few, including, Milton Greene, Carl Sandburg,  Norman \nRosten. Rosten wrote: She would often hand me a scrap of paper with something \nwritten on it  ask, \'Do you think this is poetry? Keep it  let me know.\' Or\nshe\'d send a scribbled sheet in the mail asking for criticism. I would always \nencourage her. The poems were, in the best sense, those of\nan amateur; that is, they pretended to be nothing more than an outburst of \nfeeling, with little or no knowledge of the craft. But the poet\nwithin her \x97  one existed \x97 found a form for her purpose.\n\n\n\nImperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it\'s better to be absolutely \nridiculous than absolutely boring.\n\nTo the weeping willow:\nI stood beneath your limbs\nand you flowered and finally clung to me\nand when the wind struck\x97the earth\nand sand\x97you clung to me.\n\n\n\n\nI don\'t want to make money, I just want to be wonderful.\n\n\nDon\'t cry my doll\nDon\'t cry\nI hold you and rock you to sleep\nHush hush\nI\'m pretending now\nI\'m not your mother who died.\n\nDreaming about being an actress, is more exciting than being one.\n\nThe smart one says the eye\nis not truly round.

I guess I am a fantasy.\n\nHelp Help Help \nI feel life coming closer \nWhen all I want \nIs to die.\nScream\x97\nYou began and ended in air but where was the middle? \n\nYou believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself.\n\n\nThey taught my body\nto squeeze grapes.\nWarm wine pours out.\nAnd once or twice,\na slick skin.\n\nIf you can\'t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don\'t deserve me at \nmy best.\n\nLife\x97\nI am of both of your directions\nSomehow remaining hanging downward\nbut strong as a cobweb in the wind\x97\nI exist more with the cold glistening frost.\nBut my beaded rays have the colors\nI\x92ve seen in a paintings\x97ah life they\nhave cheated you\n\nI\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull little people.\n\nI\'ve got a tear hanging over my beer that I can\'t let go\nIt\'s too bad\nI feel sad\nWhen I got all my life behind me.\nIf I had a little relief\nFrom this grief\nThen\nI could find a drowning straw to hold on to.\nIt\'s great to be alive.\nThey say I\'m lucky to be alive\nIt\'s hard to figure out\x97When everything I feel\x97Hurts.\n\nIf you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything.\n\nOnly parts of us will ever\ntouch parts of others\x97one\x92s own truth is just that really \x97 one\x92s own truth.\nWe can only share the part that is understood within another\x92s knowing\nacceptable to the other \x97 therefore one\nis for the most part alone.\nAs it is meant to be\nevidently in nature \x97 at best though perhaps it could make\nour understanding seek\nanother\x92s loneliness out.\n\nDogs never bite me, just humans.\n\n\nTo have your heart is\nthe only completely happy proud possession (that ever belonged\nto me)\n\nI restore myself when I\'m alone.\n\nOh damn I wish that I were dead\n\x97absolutely nonexistent\x97\ngone away from here,\nfrom everywhere ...\nbut how would I do it?\nThere are always bridges\x97the Brooklyn bridge\x97\nno, not the Brooklyn Bridge\nbecause I love that bridge\n(everything is beautiful from there and the air is so clean);\nwalking it seems peaceful there\neven with all those cars going crazy underneath.\nSo it would have to be some other bridge\nan ugly one and with no view\x97\nexcept that I particularly like in particular all bridges\x97\nthere\x92s something about them\nand besides I\x92ve never seen an ugly bridge ...\n\nSex is a part of nature.
