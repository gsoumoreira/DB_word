Burch, an editor and publisher\nof Holocaust and Nakba poetry\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nParkland Poems, \n\nSanta Fe Poems\n\nI am dedicating the poems on this page to the twenty children who perished as a result of the \nSandy Hook Elementary School shootings at Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, \n2012, and to the six teachers who died defending them, and to all the survivors who \ncontinue to love and mourn them. I have written tribute \npoems for the victims of this terrible tragedy, which occurred just a few days \nand nights before Christmas, using little snippets of information I found about them \nhere and there. For instance, this is an elegy I wrote for Emilie Parker, a little girl with an exceptionally \nkind spirit who used her crayons to create colorful cards for people when \nthey experienced dark times in their lives:\n\nEmilie Parker,\nthe horror grows starker\nas we see your sweet image\nand cringe at the carnage;\nbut dear, \n how you mesmerize\nwith those vivid blue eyes\nand death cannot sever\nour hearts from you, ever. \n\n\n\n\nOur hearts are broken,\nour spirits are strong.\n\nThe poem above was taken from a sign posted outside a local business after the \nshootings. President Obama concurred as he wiped away tears, saying, Our hearts \nare broken today. I took the liberty of turning his words into a poem:\n\nSandy Hook Call to Love\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nOur hearts are broken today\nfor our children\'s small bodies lie broken;\nlet us gather them up, as we may,\nthat the truth of our Love may be spoken;\nthen, when we have put them away\nto nevermore dream, or be woken,\nlet us think of the living, and pray\nfor true Love, not some miserable token,\nto command us, for strength to obey.\n\nThis poem is for mothers who lost children at Sandy Hook, and in other similar \ntragedies ...\n\nChildless\nby Michael R. Burch \n\nHow can she bear her grief? \nMightier than Atlas, she shoulders the weight \nOf one fallen star. \n\nHere are elegies and memorials for other innocent victims of this senseless and \navoidable tragedy, if only American adults would do what is necessary to protect \nour children ...\n\nDylan Hockley,\na blue-eyed gorgeous boy,\nwas super beyond\ndeath\'s power to destroy. \n\n\n\nJack Pinto,\nwho idolized the New York Jets\' Victor Cruz,\nis now Cruz\'s hero\nand neither can lose.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace Audrey McDonnell,\nour\nbeautiful, sweet little girl,\nwherever you are now,\nthere\'s a far brighter world. \n\n\n\nAvielle Richman\nhad a spirit that drew people in\n(and an infinitely knowing\nand cheeky grin!).\n\n\n\nFor a Sandy Hook Child, with Butterflies\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhere does the butterfly go\nwhen lightning rails, when thunder howls,\nwhen hailstones scream while winter scowls\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\nWhere does the butterfly go?\n\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\nWhen the only relief\'s a banked fire\'s glow,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\nand hope is lost without a trace?\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nHere is a prayer-poem that I would like to dedicate to the survivors of the \nSandy Hook massacre and the victims\' families and friends:\n\nI Pray Tonight\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI pray tonight\nthe starry light\nmight\nsurround you.\n\nI pray\neach day\nthat, come what may,\nno dark thing confound you.\n\nI pray ere the morrow\nan end to your sorrow.\nMay angels\' white chorales\nsing, and astound you.\n\n\nI would also like to quote a poem by one of my favorite contemporary poets that \nseems appropriate as we think about comforting and helping the survivors:\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby T. Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\nI am stunned to awe by the love, compassion, resourcefulness and incredible courage of Sandy Hook\'s teachers \nand faculty. Here is \nthe story of Kaitlin Roig:\n\n\n\nHere are more tribute poems for more exceptional children:\n\nNoah Pozner,\nextremely bright\x97\nyour mind and your smile\nboth exuded light. \n\nJessica Rekos,\na creative, beautiful little girl\nwho loved horses,\nare you now riding Pegasus\ndown heaven\'s courses?\n\nBenjamin Wheeler,\nan irrepressibly bright and spirited boy\nhad brown, soulful eyes\nand a spirit no killer can destroy. \n\n\n\nSandy Hook Call to Action\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWe see their tiny coffins\nand our hearts break,\nso we ask the NRA\x97\nDid you make a mistake?\nAnd we vow to save the next child\nfor sweet love\'s sake,\nbut also to protect ourselves\nfrom enduring such heartache. \n\nThose of us who oppose the Holocaust have a saying: Never again! From this day \nforward I hope that we, as a nation, will say Never again! to such carnage \namong our children because a rich, powerful gun lobby wants to flood the streets \nwith people carrying loaded, concealed weapons, taking us back to the days of \nthe Wild, Wild West. For anyone who thinks this is a good idea, I would remind \nthem that the West\'s greatest law officer, Wyatt Earp, didn\'t allow anyone to \nwalk around with guns in the towns he policed, except for himself and his \ndeputies, and that the famous battle at the OK Corral was fought over gun \ncontrol. \n\nAna Marquez-Greene was already an accomplished singer at age six, as the video \nbelow demonstrates ...\n\nAna Marquez-Greene,\nas sweet a child as we\'ve seen,\nyou beat us all to paradise.\nWas it because you were so very nice?\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte Bacon,\nour love for you is unshaken;\nas you lit up all rooms down here\nyou now illuminate heaven, dear.\n\nDaniel Barden, his family\'s light,\nonce brightened this earth, and now brightens heaven\x97\nnot a bad trick for a boy who\'s just seven! \n\n\n\nOlivia Engel,\nangel,\nyour only possible crime (I\'ve been told)\nwas being a wiggly, smiley six-year-old!\n\nAllison Wyatt,\nso shy, so sweet, so caring,\nloved to garden with her mother.\nSix pink candles, then an eternity of sharing. \n\n\n\nCatherine Violet Hubbard \nwhen you were here\nthe cupboard\nof life\nwas never bare,\nbut full of light \nand your electric hair! \n\nJosephine Gay\nhad just turned seven;\nnow she will always be \na lovely part of heaven.\n\n\n\nCaroline Previdi,\nsweet, precious little angel,\nwe fondly remember\nyour infectious smile. \n\n\n\nChase Kowalski, age seven\nseems awfully early for heaven;\nbut since there was never a better child ...\nperhaps the angels called, beguiled? \n\n\nHere is absolutely exquisite poem about lost love that I would like to \ndedicate to all the Sandy Hook victims and their parents and families:\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \n) \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\n\nThe students who died were all seven or younger. Here is a poem by one of the \nall-time great poets who lost his son at the age of seven:\n\n\nOn My First Son\nby Ben Jonson\n\n      Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\n    My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\n    Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\n    Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\n    O, could I lose all father now! For why\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\n    As what he loves may never like too much.\n\nHere are more memorial poems:\n\nJesse Lewis, so full of life, \nyou could fill a room with bright laughter;\nI\'m sure you\'re entertaining angels now\nand brightening the Hereafter!\n\nJames Mattioli,\nexceptional swimmer,\nwithout your bright presence\nthe world seems much dimmer. \n\nMadeleine Hsu,\nwhat we know of you\nis so limited, but we love you too.\nMay your loved ones keep your memory secure\nand your memory give them the strength to endure. \n\nA picture of Madeline Hsu is not available, and we should respect her \nfamily\'s desire for privacy. \n\nHere is a memorial poem for the school\'s lovely, valiant principal who, \naccording to accounts, ran to defend her young charges the minute she heard \nshots being fired, lunging at the shooter in an attempt to disarm him:\n\nDawn Hochsprung,\neach child\'s courageous friend\x97\nyou defended them all till the unthinkable end;\nso let your kindness and valor be sung. \n\n\n\nRachel Davino protected her charges\nfrom the killer\'s barrages;\nlike her loyal friend,\nshe was loyal to the end. \n\n\n\nAnne Marie Murphy, \nfun-loving, hard worker;\nyou defended your charges\x97\nno coward, no shirker. \n\nLauren Gabrielle Rousseau, \nwho loved to teach, and who loved children so,\nwe\'re glad you achieved your dream\nthat final year, and how lovely you seem! \n\n\n\nMy son, Jeremy Michael Burch, is currently a college freshman at David Lipscomb, \nwhere he intends to study to become a child psychologist like Mary Sherlach. \nTherefore, her story especially touches me. When Mary heard shots being fired, \nshe could have run away to save her own life, but she joined principal Dawn \nHochsprung by leaping to her feet and running to protect the students she loved \nso much. \n\nMary Sherlach, who courageously ran\nwithout thought for her life to the aid of the children,\ntaught not just them, but also us,\nlove\'s surplus. \n\n\n\nEveryone loved Miss Victoria Soto;\nshe was every student\'s friend.\nAnd when a killer threatened her charges,\nshe defended them to the end. \n\n\n\nI dedicate my poems to the victims \x97 may \nthey rest in peace \x97 and I urge all Americans to act\nnow, before the next massacre. If we don\'t, our loved \nones will remain continually at risk:\n\nEpitaph for a Sandy Hook Child\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died. \nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nThe lives, safety and happiness of our \nchildren depend on our ability to persuade the NRA and its political lackeys to \nstop exalting money and political gain above the life, liberty and happiness of \ninnocents. What is the cost of banning assault weapons, compared to the ultimate \nprice innocents pay when they are used by madmen playing Rambo in classrooms and \ntheaters? Ironically, just hours before the Sandy Hook massacre, in a weekly \ncolumn that I write for the Nashville City Paper, I pointed out that right-wing \npoliticians are not just demanding the right of citizens to bear loaded \nhandguns into restaurants that serve alcohol and bars \x97 a combustible mix. No, \npeople who call themselves conservative Christians in collusion with the NRA \nand its gun lobby are demanding the right to carry assault weapons everywhere \n... which logically means into universities, high schools, grade schools, \nkindergartens, pre-schools, Sunday schools and maternity wards. When I wrote \nthis, I was speaking ironically \x97 I thought \x97 but then a few hours later the NRA \nand its political minions made me seem like a prophet. \n\nShooting Gallery\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf we live by the rule of the gun\nwhat can a small child do, \nbut run?\n\n\nSixteen of the students who died at Sandy Hook were six years old; the other \nfour students were seven. I wrote the poem below for another child gunned down \nby a madman. While we cannot legislate sanity, we can be sane enough to \nlegislate away the right of serial killers to purchase assault weapons so \neasily. We can defend many small victims from such carnage, if we the people \nhave the wisdom and the will to defend them. \n\nChild of 9-11\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na poem for Christina-Taylor Green, who was born\non September 11, 2001 and died at the age of nine, \nshot to death ...\n\n\nChild of 9-11, beloved, \nI bring this lily, lay it down\nhere at your feet, and eiderdown,\nand all soft things, for your gentle spirit. \nI bring this psalm \x97 I hope you hear it.\n\nMuch love I bring \x97 I lay it down\nhere by your form, which is not you,\nbut what you left this shell-shocked world\nto help us learn what we must do\nto save another child like you.\n\nChild of 9-11, I know\nyou are not here, but watch, afar\nfrom distant stars, where angels rue\nthe brutal things some mortals do.\nI also watch; I also rue.\n\nAnd so I make this pledge and vow:\nthough I may weep, I will not rest\nnor will my pen fail heaven\'s test\ntill guns and wars and hate are banned\nfrom every shore, from every land.\n\nChild of 9-11, I grieve\nyour tender life, cut short ... bereaved,\nwhat can I do, but pledge my life\nto saving lives like yours? Belief\nin your sweet worth has led me here ...\n\nI give my all: my pen, this tear,\nthis lily and this eiderdown,\nand all soft things my heart can bear;\nI bear them to your final bier,\nand leave them with my promise, here.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings left 27 students and educators \ndead, and question our nation\'s sanity and resolve to put children\'s lives above \nmoney and politics. Why do we allow serial killers like Adam Lanza to \nhave such easy access to assault weapons and wreak destruction on innocent children \nand their teachers? Surely \nevery thinking American knows that assault weapons are being sold and \ndistributed so freely only to fill the coffers of gun dealers and the NRA, and for the political \ngain of those politicians who accept their bribes (euphemistically \ncalled campaign contributions). When will we call this evil collusion what it \nreally is: treason, infamy, and the murder of innocents? Adam Lanza may have been \ninsane, but what is the excuse of the NRA and its bribe-taking political \nlackeys?\n\nUS or Them? \nby Michael R. Burch\nThe NRA wants money in the till,\nthus Adam Lanza had a license to kill.\nOur government\x92s the serial killer\x92s shill\nand will be, unless WE express OUR will\nand vote to save our children from Boot Hill. \n\nThis haiku below makes me think of the students and teachers of Sandy Hook, who \nwere trapped in a war zone:\n\nWar\nstood at the end of the hall\nin the long shadows\n\x97original haiku by \nWatanabe Hakusen, translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIt is up to us, as a nation, to choose between the rights of adults to carry \nassault weapons and loaded, concealed weapons without restriction, and the right \nof children not to be exposed to the war zones that other dubious right \ncreates in school hallways. Are we going to make it legal for anyone with a \ngrudge against life to carry out Rambo-like assaults in grade school classrooms \nand corridors? What if the next would-be Rambo wants to up the ante by shooting \nup a kindergarten or nursery school?\n\n\nPiercing the Shell\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf we strip away all the accouterments of war,\nperhaps we\'ll discover what the heart is for.\n\nIt seems to me that the NRA has declared a war \x97  an \nopen season \x97 on our children, by insisting that \nassault weapons must be available to every Tom, Dick and Dirty Harry. But what \nwill we, the people, say and do?\n\nWhence Now?\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nGrown darkly accustomed to grief,\nwill we ever turn over a new leaf?\n\nWho knows what wonderful things the twenty dead children and the seven \ndead educators might have accomplished, if they had lived? Now they are only \nmemories, and for most of the world memories diffuse with time. Let us try to \nkeep them alive in our minds and hearts, and prevent what happened to them from \nhappening to other innocents and their caregivers. \n\nSomething\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSomething inescapable is lost\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\nimmeasurable and void.\n\nSomething uncapturable is gone\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\nand remembrance.\n\nSomething unforgettable is past\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\n\nIt is hard to think of mothers not having the chance to say goodbye to their \nchildren, and just as hard to think of them having to say goodbye. Surely as a \nnation we must do everything possible to prevent either scenario, to the best of \nour ability. \n\n\nFrail Envelope of Flesh\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFrail envelope of flesh,\nlying cold on the surgeons table\nwith anguished eyes\nlike your mothers eyes\nand a heartbeat weak, unstable ...\n\nFrail crucible of dust,\nbrief flower come to this\nyour tiny hand\nin your mothers hand\nfor a last bewildered kiss ...\n\nBrief mayfly of a child,\nto live six artless years!\nNow your mothers lips\nseal up your lips\nfrom the Deluge of her tears ...\n\nHere is a touching poem by one of the all-time great poets, William Blake. It \ncalls us to remember the innocence and potential of even the youngest children. \nSurely it is up to us to protect them and make sure they wake to see each new \nmorning, until they realize their full potential.\n\n\nCradle Songby William Blake\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n \nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n \nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n \nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\nTo close, here are three beautiful poems about the process of learning who \nanother person is, losing that person, and the sometimes difficult struggle to \nfind rest and peace ...\n\n\nSong For The Last Act \nby Louise Bogan\n\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\n\nBread and Music\n\nby Conrad Aiken\n\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\n\n\nUphill \nby Christina Rossetti\n\nDoes the road wind up-hill all the way?\n Yes, to the very end.\nWill the day\'s journey take the whole long day?\n From morn to night, my friend.\n\nBut is there for the night a resting-place?\n A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\nMay not the darkness hide it from my face?\n You cannot miss that inn.\n\nShall I meet other wayfarers at night?\n Those who have gone before.\nThen must I knock, or call when just in sight?\n They will not keep you standing at that door.\n\nShall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?\n Of labour you shall find the sum.\nWill there be beds for me and all who seek?\n Yea, beds for all who come.\n\nIf you read this far, I thank you very much for your time, and I ask you once \nagain to consider doing everything you can to help prevent similar things from \nhappening to other students and their educators and caregivers. \n\nRelated Pages:\n\nParkland Poems, \n\nSanta Fe Poems, Courtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\nColumbine Poems,\n\n\nDarfur \nPoems,\nGaza \nPoems,\n\nHaiti Poems, Hiroshima \nPoems, Holocaust Poems,\n\nNakba Poems,\n\n911 Poems,\nTrail \nof Tears\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
