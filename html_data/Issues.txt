He has also been credited \r\nwith writing the first Valentines Day poem.\r\nIs Jimmy Carter a good poet?\r\nMuch depends on what one means by good. Jimmy Carter is certainly a capable \r\nwriter. Some of his poems do little for me personally, but I have read a few \r\nthat seem pretty good. For instance:\r\n\r\nI Wanted to Share My Father\'s World\r\nby Jimmy Carter\r\n\r\nThis is a pain I mostly hide, \r\nbut ties of blood, or seed endure, \r\nand even now I \r\nfeel inside \r\nthe hunger for his outstretched hand, \r\na man\'s embrace to take me in, \r\n\r\nthe need for just a word of praise.\r\n\r\nThe internal rhymes of ties with hide and inside, of man with hand, of \r\nendure with hunger, and of need with seed make this a sonically dense \r\nlittle poem. I think this is good poetry, and I like the poem.\r\n Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nPoems \r\nfor Children by Michael R.

Meleager is most famous today for \r\nThe Garland, an anthology of \r\nepigrammatic poems written over the previous two centuries. In its preface \r\nMeleager names his contributors and assigns each poet the name of a flower, \r\nshrub or herb (hence the title). This work was subsumed into what has become \r\nknown as The Greek Anthology. In his commentary on The Greek Anthology, editor \r\nand translator J. H. Merivale said of Meleager that as a composer of epigrams \r\nhe was very far superior to the authors he included in The Garland. \r\n\r\nJuly 2019\r\n\r\nVera Ignatowitsch \r\nreturns to our Spotlight with a hard-hitting poem, I Will Not.

Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATTERTON \r\n(recently updated)\r\n\r\nWhy did William Wordsworth call Thomas Chatterton the marvellous Boy, \r\ncapitalizing the b? Why did John Keats called him the purest writer in the \r\nEnglish language and write Endymion in a feverish attempt to set Chatterton \r\namong the stars / Of highest heaven? Why did Samuel Taylor Coleridge work on \r\nhis first published poem, Monody on the Death of Chatterton, on-and-off for \r\nmore than forty years, so that it was also one of his last published poems? Why \r\ndid Percy Bysshe Shelley name Chatterton among his inheritors of unfulfilled \r\nrenown? One would think great poets would recognize great poetry when they \r\nencountered it, and the great Romantics thought Thomas Chatterton was a truly \r\ngreat poet, even though he died at age seventeen. \r\n\r\nCharlotte Turner Smith \r\nwas an early Romantic poet who published in her own name and spoke for women\'s \r\nrights in a male-dominated era.

Then, thanks to \r\nresearch \r\nby Simon Edge, our advisory editor Tom Merrill became aware that Dolben was not \r\nonly a poet, but an exceptional poet in our opinion, even though he drowned at age nineteen. \r\nFortunately, the prodigy\'s poems were collected and published by an English poet \r\nlaureate, Robert \r\nBridges, who also published the poems of Hopkins.

Darrow was also a \r\nleading member of the American Civil Liberties Union, a founding attorney for \r\nthe NAACP, an advocate of free love who practiced what he preached, a staunch \r\nopponent of the death penalty, and, like Voltaire, a champion of underdogs and \r\ntheir right to a fair shake. During his heyday as a defense attorney in Chicago, \r\nDarrow represented more than 100 defendants and only lost one murder case. He \r\nwas renowned for moving juries (and sometimes judges) to tears with his \r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nPeggy Landsman is the author of a poetry chapbook,To-wit To-woo(Foothills \r\nPublishing), and an out-of-print romance novel,Passion\'s Professor(Midnight \r\nShowcase), which she wrote under the pen name Samantha Rhodes.

While he is best known \r\ntoday for his innovative jazz poetry and as a leading figure of the Harlem \r\nRenaissance, Hughes actually spent most of his childhood in Lawrence, Kansas. In \r\nhis 1940 autobiographyThe Big Seahe wrote: I was unhappy for a long \r\ntime, and very lonesome, living with my grandmother. Then it was that books \r\nbegan to happen to me, and I began to believe in nothing but books and the \r\nwonderful world in books  where if people suffered, they suffered in beautiful \r\nlanguage, not in monosyllables, as we did in Kansas. The descendent of enslaved \r\nAfrican Americans and their white enslavers on his father\'s side, Hughes spoke \r\nboth frankly and passionately about the problems of race in America. And he \r\nspoke eloquently in a highly original voice that continues to influence American \r\npoetry and music to this day. \r\n\r\n\r\nJack Arkell is a \r\npoet and writer from Birmingham, England.

In my opinion she\'s a major poet; \r\nat least two other critics \r\nagree, as she has been called the most accomplished woman poet of the twentieth century \r\nand one of the finest lyric poets America has produced.

It is one of the oldest \r\nsongs that can still be sung today.\r\n\r\nFowles in the Frith, \r\nalso circa 1260 AD, expresses deep sympathy for beasts of bone and \r\nblood in an arresting short lyric. Or is the sorrow expressed for a lover, or \r\nJesus Christ?\r\n\r\nIch \r\nam of Irlaunde (I am of Ireland) has been dated to around the same \r\ntime.\r\nI Have a Yong Suster \r\n(I Have a Young Sister) is an anonymous Medieval English poem that has been \r\ndescribed as a haunting riddle-chant, circa 1430 AD.\r\nIn 1503 William Dunbar\'s\r\n\r\nstellar \r\nSweet Rose of Virtue \r\nand\r\nLament for the Makaris \r\nappeared in the first book of Scottish poems.\r\nIn 1620 the Pilgrims set sail for America in the Mayflower; they landed at Cape Cod \r\nand founded the New Plymouthcolony.\r\nTom \r\nO\'Bedlam\'s Song was published \r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nS.

Since he had no travel \r\nallowance, nor in fact any money at all, he conceived a daring plan, and sailed \r\nto Europe on a freighter as a stowaway. Stolen cans of ngapi helped keep him \r\nalive during the long boatride. In Marseilles he succeeded in safely debarking \r\nin a crateful of silks. He slipped out of the box later the same day and cut \r\nthrough some corrugated metal siding with a tool he had brought. A new world lay \r\nbefore him. His English was acquired as a child from an imam who thought he \r\nshowed promise. He now lives with a Moldovan gentleman, with whom he sips \r\nwonderful Moldovan wines and shares a bed.

After working as a carpenter, \r\nsawmill operator, songwriter, and artisan bread baker, he became the Kenan \r\nFellow at U.N.C. Chapel Hill from 2008-2010. Wil was the Writer-in-Residence at \r\nCovenant College when he died in 2011 following a two-month battle with liver \r\ncancer. His Selected Poems (May 2013), edited by his wife Kathryn, were \r\npublished posthumously by the University of Evansville Press in 2013. His last \r\ntwo manuscripts, Arriving on Time and The World That Isn\'t There, \r\nare forthcoming from Measure Press in 2017.\r\n\r\nBorn in Montr\xe9al, \r\nYves L-Thrace \r\nwas passionate about art at a very young age. As a child, he converted the \r\nfamily shed into an art studio and worked with oil and charcoal. By the age of \r\n16, he discovered the American poet Walt Whitman and a number of French poets \r\nincluding Arthur Rimbaud. Later, he became keenly interested in oriental \r\nmysticism as well as in Chinese and Japanese art and poetry. \r\n\r\nOlfa Philo is an English teacher, a PhD scholar and a committed \r\npoetess from Tunisia.

She is generally considered to be one of the very best \r\ncontemporary Arab poets. The sister of the poet Ibrahim Tuqan, she was born in \r\nNablus in 1917. She began writing in traditional forms, but became one of the \r\nleaders of the use of the free verse in Arabic poetry. Her work often deals with \r\nfeminine explorations of love and social protest, particularly of Israel\'s \r\noccupation of Palestinian territories. We have recently updated her poetry page \r\nwith three new translations by THT editor Michael R. Burch.\r\n\r\nWe have added two new poems to the poetry page of\r\nJohn Beaton.\r\n\r\nFamous Poems \r\nabout Drinking\r\n\r\nFamous Songs \r\nabout Drinking\r\n\r\nTHT editor Michael R.

Prior to November 2001, THT didn\'t have issues, per \r\nse, and was not updated on a monthly basis, but merely upon the caprice of its \r\nfounder and editor (i.e. me, Mike Burch). When did THT start? I don\'t \r\nrightly remember! But I was able to use the Wayback Machine to find the earliest \r\nextant version of THT, circa March 2001. At that time we had separate \r\npages for the Masters; they included Matthew Arnold, William Blake, Ernest \r\nDowson, Robert Frost, A. E. Housman, Ben Jonson, Edgar Allan Poe, Wilfred Owen, \r\nE. A. Robinson, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, and W. B. Yeats. Our first cadre of \r\ncontemporary poets included Harvey Stanbrough, Annie Finch, A. E. Stallings (the \r\nfirst big fish we landed), Dr. Joseph S. Salemi, William F. Carlson, Jennifer \r\nReeser, Kevin N. Roberts, Michael Pendragon, and Michael R. Burch. From April to \r\nOctober 2001 we added the following contemporary poets: Roger Hecht, Louise \r\nJaffe, Esther Cameron, Jack Granath, Carmen Willcox, Dr. Alfred Dorn, Wade \r\nNewman, Patrick Kanouse, Joyce Wilson, Mary Rae (the winner of our first and \r\nonly poetry contest), Ric Masten and Ursula T. Gibson. In the early days, Bill \r\nCarlson was a godsend, as he put us in touch, either directly or indirectly \r\nthrough his website and its links to Expansive Poetry  Music Online, \r\nwith roughly half the poets we published in our formative days: himself, Dorn, \r\nSalemi, Cameron, Newman, Hecht (via Newman, his literary executor), Jaffe, \r\nGranath, Reeser and Richard Moore. The second largest pool of poets came from \r\nto us from the ranks of the New Romantics: Kevin N. Roberts, Michael Pendragon, \r\nCarmen Willcox and Mary Rae. We found Harvey Stanbrough through The Raintown \r\nReview, which he founded and was still editing at the time. Some poets we \r\nfound through the grapevine and the Internet: Stallings, Finch, Wilson, \r\nMasten, Gibson. We found Kanouse either through Carlson or Stanbrough.\r\nJust when was The HyperTexts originally created? I\'m not sure. \r\nProbably between 1998 and 2000, since the site already had considerable content \r\nin early 2001, with a total of 21 poets in its Masters and Contemporary Poets \r\nindexes, not to mention fairly extensive Esoterica and Rock Jukebox pages. In \r\nJuly 2004 we recorded our hit counter for the first time: 16,787. But I don\'t \r\nremember when I added it, so any number of early hits were probably not \r\nrecorded. In four months of 2008 alone, THT had around 30,000 hits on \r\nits main page. So our readership has obviously grown dramatically. We seem to \r\nget as many hits in four months as we once did in four years.\r\n\r\nWhy did I start The HyperTexts? Again, I really don\'t remember. I \r\nknow I bought a copy of Microsoft Frontpage, the program I used to create \r\nTHT, probably just before the turn of century, in order to edit the website \r\nof the software company I own, Alpha Omega Consulting Group, Inc. At the time \r\nAlpha Omega had a programmer, Steve Harris, who had experience designing \r\nwebsites, so I imagine I bought the program on his recommendation. Steve left \r\nAlpha Omega toward the end of 2000, so I suppose around that time I had to take \r\nover editing the company website. So perhaps I created THT in order to \r\nlearn the basics of HTML. It would have been natural for me to create a literary \r\nwebsite, as a way of learning my way around HTML, because whenever I needed to \r\nlearn a new programming language, I always started with something functional \r\nthat I had the expertise to design and critique. I doubt that I had any real \r\nintention of being an editor and publisher of poetry at the time. I do remember \r\ngetting in contact with A. E. (Alicia) Stallings and asking if I could publish a \r\nfew of her poems. Her graciousness no doubt encouraged me to go after other \r\npoets. Annie Finch and Harvey Stanbrough were other poets I admired who gave me \r\npermission to publish their poems. Through my connection with Michael \r\nPendragon, who published my poems in the literary journals Penny Dreadful \r\nand Songs of Innocence and the poetry anthology The Bible of Hell, \r\nI met Kevin N. Roberts, the founder and editor of Romantics Quarterly. \r\nAs I helped Kevin get Romantics Quarterly off the ground, with \r\nfinancial assistance and suggestions, I began to see something of a larger role \r\nfor myself, in the grand scheme of things, and THT soon became a \r\nlaunching pad of sorts for literary journals on tight budgets that didn\'t have \r\ntheir own websites. Those were the days before every man and his dog had a blog.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 I published Rhina Espaillat, and over the years she has helped THT \r\npublish the work of a number of her fellow Powow River Poets, including Michael \r\nCantor, Deborah Warren, Len Krisak, Mike Juster and Midge Goldberg.\r\nIn 2002 I published Jack Butler, the first poet in an Arkansas connection \r\nthat now includes Jack, Greg Alan Brownderville, Jim Barnes, and R. S. (Sam) \r\nGwynn.\r\nIn early 2003 I ran free advertisements for Joe Ruggier\'s literary journal,\r\nThe Eclectic Muse, and for his collection of books on CD, which my \r\nsoftware company helped Joe create. My relationship with Joe soon led THT \r\nto join forces with Joe\'s Multicultural Books (MBooks) imprint, and before long \r\nwe had published books by Emery Campbell, Zyskandar Jaimot, T. Merrill and V. \r\nUlea, with hopefully more to come.\r\nAlso in 2003 I published Yala Korwin, a Holocaust survivor, and soon with the \r\nhelp of Yala and Esther Cameron, THT was able to bring a number of poems by \r\nJewish ghetto poets and other Holocaust poets that had never appeared in English \r\nbefore. Our early Holocaust pages included those of Janusz Korczak and Elie \r\nWiesel, which were published in 2004.\r\nIn 2005, I published the work of T. (Tom) Merrill, and this was the beginning \r\nof yet another fruitful relationship. Tom has devoted much time to THT, \r\nand he is now our Poet in Residuum. In addition to gracing our pages with his \r\npoems, essays and poet intros, Tom is a proofreader par excellence. And he has \r\ndirected us to a number of poets we wouldn\'t have known about otherwise, \r\nincluding Agnes Wathall, Eunice de Chazeau and Mary Malone.\r\nIn 2006, I published the poetry of Jeffery Woodward, and he has gone on to \r\ncontribute a number of pages to our Blasts from the Past series, earning a \r\nhonorable mention on our masthead. And so THT\'s editors and associates \r\nnow consist of me, Tom, Joe and Jeffrey.\r\nAs I pen this retrospective (written on December 12, 2008), THT ranks in the \r\ntop ten with Google for a number of our primary search terms: the hypertexts \r\n(#1), hypertexts (#2), formal poetry (#2), contemporary formal poetry (#3), the \r\nMasters poetry (#2), Darfur poetry (#1), Holocaust poetry (#10), ghetto poets \r\n(#2), Nelson Mandela poetry (#1), Elie Wiesel poetry (#1), Leonard Nimoy poetry \r\n(#1), Ronald Reagan poetry (#1), Pope John Paul II poetry (#1), Karol Wojtyla \r\npoetry (#1), Nadia Anjuman poetry (#1 and #2), Mikl\xf3s Radn\xf3ti poetry (#1), \r\nFormalist poetry (#5). And we\'re ranked extremely high by Google for searches \r\nfor many of the poets we\'ve published: X. J. Kennedy poetry (#1), Richard Moore \r\npoetry (#1 and #2), Esther Cameron poetry (#1 and #2), George Held poetry (#1), \r\nJack Butler poetry (#3 and #4), Ethna Carbery poetry (#3), etc.\r\nIn a few cases, such as Richard Moore\'s and Esther Cameron\'s, we even rank \r\nabove the poets\' personal and/or literary websites. And in many cases, we rank \r\nnumber one with Google in searches for our poets\' names, sans modifiers, as with \r\nEunice de Chazeau, Alfred Dorn, Rhina P. Espaillat, Roger Hecht, George Held, T. \r\nS. Kerrigan, Yala Korwin, Leslie Mellichamp, Robert Mezey, Joseph S. Salemi, and \r\nAgnes Wathall, just to drop a few names. These are men and women with serious \r\naccomplishments, so it\'s interesting to see THT ranking number one, even above \r\nWikipedia, as we sometimes do.\r\nWhere will THT go from here? Perhaps as high and far as Google can help us \r\nfly . . .\r\nMike Burch\r\nDecember 12, 2008\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
