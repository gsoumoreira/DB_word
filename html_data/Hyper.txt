We are grown,\nand time has thrown us free under the timeless moon.\n\nThis has long been one of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. When people \nbemoan the state of the art, I think of poems like this one and find small \ncause for concern. \n\n\n\nThe Ghost Ship\nby A. E. Stallings\n\nShe plies an inland sea. Dull\nWith rust, scarred by a jagged reef.\nIn Cyrillic, on her hull\nIs lettered, Grief.\n\nThe dim stars do not signify;\nNo sonar with its eerie ping\nSounds the depthsshe travels by\nDead reckoning.\n\nAt her heart is a stopped clock.\nIn her wake, the hours drag.\nThere is no port where she can dock,\nShe flies no flag,\n\nHas no allegiance to a state,\nNo registry, no harbor berth,\nNowhere to discharge her freight\nUpon the earth.\n\nA. E. Stallings is a contemporary poet who\'s leaving her mark on the world in \nthe form of memorable poems like this one. \n\n\n\nSea Fevers\nby Agnes Wathall\n\nNo ancient mariner I,\n Hawker of public crosses,\nSnaring the passersby\n With my necklace of albatrosses.\n\nI blink no glittering eye\n Between tufts of gray sea mosses\nNor in the high road ply\n My trade of guilts and glosses.\n\nBut a dark and inward sky\n Tracks the flotsam of my losses.\nNo more becalmed to lie,\n The skeleton ship tosses.\n\nWhile few readers today may have heard of Agnes Wathall, her "Sea Fevers" is a poem that \ndeserves, even demands, remembering.\n\n\r\nDispensing Keys\r\nby Hafiz\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\nThe imbecile\r\nconstructs cages \r\nfor everyone he knows,\r\nwhile the sage\r\n(who has to duck his head\r\nwhenever the moon glows)\r\nkeeps dispensing keys \r\nall night long\r\nto the beautiful, rowdy,\r\nprison gang.\r\n\r\nI just love the wisdom and spirit of Hafiz in this subversive (pardon the pun) \nlittle poem. I can see Trump putting refugees in cages, while Hafiz goes around \nletting them out for a moondance!\r\n\n\n\nSometimes Mysteriously\nby Luis Omar Salinas\n\nSometimes in the evening when love\ntunes its harp and the crickets\ncelebrate life, I am like a troubadour\nin search of friends, loved ones,\nanyone who will share with me\na bit of conversation. My loneliness\narrives ghostlike and pretentious,\nit seeks my soul, it is ravenous\nand hurting. I admire my father\nwho always has advice in these matters,\nbut a game of chess won\'t do, or\nthe frivolity of religion.\nI want to find a solution, so I\nwrite letters, poems, and sometimes\nI touch solitude on the shoulder\nand surrender to a great tranquility.\nI understand I need courage\nand sometimes, mysteriously,\nI feel whole.\n\nLuis Omar Salinas (1937-2008) was a leading American Chicano poet who called himself the \nAztec Angel and the Crazy Gypsy in two of his best-known poems. Salinas\nhas been called \none of the founding fathers of Chicano poetry in America and his poems have \nbeen canonized in U.S. Hispanic literature. I met this fine poet and \ngentleman through the artist Karen Harlow, and it was my honor and pleasure to \npublish his work.\n\n\n\n\nRelease\nby R. S. Sam Gwynn\n\nSlow for the sake of flowers as they turn\n Toward sunlight, graceful as a line of sail\n Coming into \nthe wind. Slow for the mill\nWheel\'s heft and plummet, for the chug and churn\n Of water as it gathers, for the frail\n Half-life of \nspraylets as they toss and spill.\n\nFor all that lags and eases, all that shows\n The winding-downward and diminished scale\n Of days \ndeclining to a twilit chill,\nBreathe quietly, release into repose:\n\n \nBe still.\n\nSam Gwynn is one of the better-known contemporary formalist poets.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResemblances\r\nby Gail White\n\nSomewhere along the primrose path\r\nThat led to my seventies,\r\nI lost the blithe agility\r\nOf the young springbok\'s knees,\r\n\r\nThe swift gait of the wildebeest\r\nRunning with its herd,\r\nAnd the keen eye of the crouching cat\r\nUnder the nesting bird,\r\n\r\nRetaining only the stoic love\r\nOf the elephant for its kin\r\nAnd the fierce desire of the salmon\r\nFor the stream it was nurtured in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Confession\nby X. J. \nKennedy\n\nBlood thudded in my ears. I scuffed,\nSteps stubborn, to the telltale booth\nBeyond whose curtained portal coughed\nThe robed repositor of truth.\nThe slat shot back. The universe\nBowed down his cratered dome to hear\nEnumerated my each curse,\nThe sip snitched from my old man\'s beer,\nMy sloth pride envy lechery,\nThe dime held back from Peter\'s Pence\nwith which I\'d bribed my girl to pee\nThat I might spy her instruments.\nHovering scale-pans when I\'d done\nSettled their balance slow as silt\nWhile in the restless dark I burned\nBright as a brimstone in my guilt\nUntil as one feeds birds he doled\nSeven our Fathers and a Hail\nWhich I to double-scrub my soul\nIntoned twice at the altar rail\nWhere Sunday in seraphic light\nI knelt, as full of grace as most,\nAnd stuck my tongue out at the priest:\nA fresh roost for the Holy Ghost.\n\nI have absolutely loved this poem by X. J. Kennedy since the day I first read \nit. It \ncaptures both the spirit and the sense of a boy\'s "First Confession," and his \ntruant tongue\'s triumphant revenge.\n\n\n\nI Have a Crush on the Devil\nby Rose Kelleher\n\n\nI have a crush on the devil, teehee!\nIts wrong, but those horns just do something to me,\nthat little mustache, the seductive goatee.\n\nIve got a crush on Beelzebub, dash it!\nThat arrow-tipped tail of his has such panache; it\nwould make a nice whip. I like watching him thrash it.\n\nIve got a longing for Lucifer, darn it!\nTheres something about all that Evil Incarnate,\nhis naked red skin like a shimmering garnet.\n\nIve got a school-girlish thing for Hells King,\ninfernal, eternally barbecuing!\nThe respectable angels just havent his zing.\n\nThis zany poem by a contemporary poet has long been one of my personal \nfavorites. \n\n\n\nAfter the Rain\nby Jared Carter\n\nAfter the rain, its time to walk the field\nagain, near where the river bends. Each year\nI come to look for what this place will yield\nlost things still rising here.\nThe farmers plow turns over, without fail,\na crop of arrowheads, but where or why\nthey fall is hard to say. They seem, like hail,\ndropped from an empty sky,\nyet for an hour or two, after the rain\nhas washed away the dusty afterbirth\nof their return, a few will show up plain\non the reopened earth.\nStill, even these are hard to see\nat first they look like any other stone.\nThe trick to finding them is not to be\ntoo sure about whats known;\nconvictions liable to say straight off\nthis ones a leaf, or that ones merely clay,\nand miss the point: after the rain, soft\nfurrows show one way\nacross the field, but what is hidden here\nrequires a different viewthe glance of one\nnot looking straight ahead, who in the clear\nlight of the morning sun\nsimply keeps wandering across the rows,\nletting his own perspective change.\nAfter the rain, perhaps, something will show,\nglittering and strange.\n\nI admire this poem by the contemporary poet Jared Carter, especially its closing lines. This poem capitalizes on the \npoet\'s capacity for wonder.\n\n\n\nI empty\n\nby Zyskandar A. Jaimot\n\nmyself\ninto\nyou\nAnd wonder\nafterwards\nlying spent\nat times\nstill twitching\nif recovery\nwill include\nthose same \nsmall dreams\nwhispered \nonce again.\n\n\n\nThe Deep Season\nby \nCatherine Chandler\n\nGood-bye to lavish mercies. Green and lush,\nthe harmless scam\nlies exposed by little deathsa blush,\na ssured dam,\nsome mild dismay. Diminishment. The hush\nof who I am.\n\nFirst snow has not yet fallen, and the sun\nis stinging bright,\ndemanding discipline, as one by one,\nmy once airtight\nbeloved arguments have come undone,\novernight.\n\nI see the forest. I can see each tree,\nthe blackened ground,\nthe eld behind, the space inside of me\nthat makes no sound,\nyet aches for what Im not, but need to be\nlost. Then found.\n\nCatherine Chandler won the 2016 Richard Wilbur award for her bookThe Frangible \nHour.\n\n\n\nIn The Dark Season\nby Richard Moore\n\nI\n\n I fall\nout of the foliage of my feelings.\n That is\nthe beginning, the ending,\n when\nthe orange peels appear\n from\nthe shrinking lips of the snow\n and\nbroken bottles, still clinging to their labels,\n in the\ngutter outside the church.\n A silk\nstocking coils in the mud.\n In the\ndark season, someone has sown\n the\nseed of confusion. The church will graze\n on the\nflowers, the fruits of love,\n the\nsoft nutritious pulp of remorse.\n Do\nthese events signify\nsummertime in another hemisphere?\n One\nstudied a new language in the darkness,\n looked\nfar down into the well,\n into\nthe hints of sunlight in its depths.\n\nII\n\n We are\ndead such a long time before\n and\nwill be dead such a long time after\n this\nleaping into light\n as a\ndolphin leaps from the sea\n and\ncarries the glare of that moment\n back\namong the curious creatures\n who\nhave not known the light.\n Don\'t\ntell me this is like Plato\'s cave;\n I know\nthat. But in death, our element,\n who\nswims with us? Do we even?\n If God\nis light...No, but there may be,\n as the\npoet says, a soft monster\n deeply\nsleeping among his thousand\n arms\nunder millennia\nunnumbered, and enormous polypi.\n I think\nwe have been frightened into life\n as fish\nleap from greater fish below.\n We cry angrily in our cradles,\n then\novercome, grow tranquil through the years,\nhopefully, ready ever for the depths\n ever\nready for us.\n\nIII\n\nYes, but of course, there is the need\nfor symmetry. Matter calls out\nfor antimatter, which forthwith\nsings in the shadows. Thus, tonight\nstreetlight fingers new foliage\nwith breezes making light of it,\nwhere unseen trunk divides itself\ninto a multitude of tips\nabove ground and below, as in\na mirror, strangers to each other,\ntwo lives, depending on each other,\ntherefore the same life: in dark depth\nand moisture one, in dry sunlight\nthe other: God and Satan, one,\nfemale and male in each one, one.\nDolphins from darkness visit light.\nWho from her glitter visits us?\nThese, lost inside you: look outside\nin the not-you: you find them there.\n\nRichard Moore was a poet, performer, novelist, essayist, teacher, philosopher \nand mathematiciana real renaissance man. \n\n\n\n\nDepths\nby Richard Moore\n\nOnce more home is a strange place: by the ocean a\nbig house now, and the small houses are memories,\n once live images, vacant\n thoughts here, sinking and vanishing.\n\nRough sea now on the shore thundering brokenly\ndraws back stones with a roar out into quiet and\n far depths, darkly to lie there\n years, yearsthere not a sound from them.\n\nNew waves out of the night\'s mist and obscurity\nlunge up high on the beach, spending their energy,\n each wave angrily dying,\n all shapes endlessly altering,\n\nyet out there in the depths nothing is modified.\nEarthquakes won\'t even moveno, nor the hurricane\n one stone there, nor a glance of\n sun\'s light stir its identity.\n\nThis is a wonderfully haunting poem by the contemporary poet Richard Moore, who \nlived in a dilapidated mansion close by the sea, until his death.\n\n\n\n\nMiscarried\nby Rhina P. \nEspaillat\n\n\n\nBlind little fish baffled but not quite\ncaught in the net of our need, what did you taste\nin us that compelled you to cheat the tide\nof our biography? Minutest beast\n\ncaged by our bloods unwisdom, what clever\nstratagem so undid you that, done out\nof you, we stand at the coast of Never\nto bid you this farewell? Least cosmonaut\n\nloosed from the look of us as from a suit\nof times weaving, in what pure alien form\ndid you slip home again across those mute\nlight years to nothing, missing and still warm?\n\nRhina P. Espaillat, in addition to being a fine poet and translator, is also a \nwonderful human being. \n\n\n\nFriday\nby Ann Drysdale\n\nThe print of a bare foot, the second toe\nA little longer than the one which is\nTraditionally designated "great".\nPraxiteles would have admired it.\n\nYou must have left in haste; your last wet step\nBefore boarding your suit and setting sail,\nOutlined in talcum on the bathroom floor\nMocks your habitual fastidiousness.\n\nThere is no tide here to obliterate\nYour oversight. Unless I wipe or sweep\nOr suck it up, it will not go away.\nThe thought delights me. I will keep the footprint.\n\nToo slight, too simply human to be called\nToken or promise; I am keeping it\nBecause it is a precious evidence\nThat on this island I am not alone.\n\nAnn Drysdale is one of the better contemporary poets that I\'ve had the honor and \npleasure of publishing. Her poem "Friday" evinces a keen eye, irony, humor and \nsomething of a child\'s sense of wonder.\n\n\n\nCome Lord and Lift\nby Tom Merrill\n\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\n Abandoned on the ground;\nThe soul bereft and longing so\n To have the lost be found.\n\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\n Its sweet love answering,\nOr out of ether one faint note\n Of living comfort wring.\n\nThis poem (the poet is an atheist) seems like both an earnest, heartfelt prayer \nand a condemnation of religion\'s dubious God to me. Why doesn\'t he have \ncompassion for fallen fledglings, one wonders? . . .\n\n\n\nCicada Cadence\nby\nHenry \nGeorge Fischer\n\nAgain the sounds of summer resonate\nAs chitinous cicadas, locusts, crickets\nSome stridently, some softly, stridulate\nIn hills and valleys, meadows, woods and thickets.\n\nThey\'re here, those ambient gambists, each astride\nA twig or leaf or swaying blade of grass,\nAnd mesmerize our dozing ears, misguide\nUs into thinking none of this will pass\n\nA notion the nocturnal croaking caucus\nOf katydids denies, whose farthest cry\nBy day\'s outdone in August by the raucous\nBuzzing of the dogday harvest fly,\n\nRipsawing inspissated heat, portending,\nIn its crescendo, an inevitable ending.\n\nIn addition to being an accomplished poet, Henry George Fischer \n[1923-2006] was the Metropolitan Museum of Art curator emeritus of Egyptology who helped the Temple of Dendur find a new life in New York.\n\n\n\nThe Lovemaker\n\nby Robert Mezey\n\nI see you in her bed,\nDark, rootless epicene,\nWhere a lone ghost is laid\nAnd other ghosts convene;\n\nAnd hear you moan at last\nYour pleasure in the deep\nHaven of her who kissed\nYour blind mouth into sleep.\n\nBut body, once enthralled,\nWakes in the chains it wore,\nDishevelled, stupid, cold,\nAnd famished as before,\n\nAnd hears its paragon\nBreathe in the ghostly air,\nAnonymous carrion\nRavished by despair.\n\nLovemaker, I have felt\nDesire take my part,\nBut lacked your constant fault\nAnd something of your art,\n\nAnd would not bend my knees\nTo the unmantled pride\nThat left you in that place,\nForever unsatisfied.\n\nThis is another of my favorite poems by a contemporary poet. Other poems by Robert Mezey appear elsewhere on this page.\n\n\n\nWulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous Ballad, circa 960 AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\t\n\tTo my people he\'s prey, a pariah.\n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \n\tUngelc is s! \n\t(We are so unalike, otherwise, different, unwelcome, alien to each other!)\n\n\tWulf fled to a faraway island:\n\this fen-fastened fortress.\n\tHere, slaughter-cruel curs howl for blood. \n\tThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \n\tUngelc is s!\n\nMy heart hounded Wulf\'s weary wanderings ...\n\tbut whenever I wailed with the storm-winds,\n\tbig battle-strong arms grabbed and embraced me:\n\tgood feelings for him, but for me loathsome!\n\tUngelc is s.\n\t\nWulf, my Wulf! These violent love-longings\n\thave left me useless; your seldom-comings\n\thave left me famished, deprived of real meat! \n\t\n\tHave you heard, Heaven-Watcher? \n\tA wolf has borne our wretched whelp to the woods!\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\n\tour song together.\n\n"Wulf and Eadwacer" is, perhaps, the first great English poem by a female poet, \nalthough it was written in a language closer to German than modern English. I \nwas never completely happy with the "updated" versions of the poem I was able to find, \nso I decided to translate it myself, borrowing from the work of previous translators. The closing metaphor of a loveless sexual relationship being \nlike a song in which two voices never harmonized is stunning: one \nof the first great metaphors in the English poetic tradition. "Wulf and \nEadwacer" appeared in the Exeter Book, which has been dated at around 960 AD, \nbut the poem itself may be much older. Is it possible that the first truly great English \npoem was written by a woman?\n\n\n\nThe Missionary\'s Position\nby Joseph S. Salemi\n\nI maintain it all was for the best\nWe hacked our way through jungle and sought out\nThese savage children, painted and half-dressed,\nTo set their minds at ease, and dispel doubt.\n\nConcerning what? Why, God\'s immense design,\nAnd how it governs all we do and see.\nBefore, they had no sense of the divine\nBeyond the sticks and bones of sorcery.\n\nGranted, they are more somber and subdued,\nKnowing that lives are watched, and judged, and weighed.\nSubject to fits of melancholy mood,\nThey look upon the cross, and are afraid.\n\nWhat would you have me say? We preached the Word\nBetter endured in grief than left unheard.\n\nThis is a poem that ought to cure "Christian" missionaries of their evangelistic \nzeal, if only they had hearts capable of compassion for the children they \nterrorize, and brains capable of reason. I have long admired this powerful poem, \nwhich was written by a contemporary Catholic poet.\n\n\n\n\nThou Art Weighed in the Balances...\nby Quincy R. \nLehr\n\nThis is the story of a bunny\nadd batteries and watch him go\nin every unforeseen direction.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nSomeone whispers on my shoulder.\nAngel? Devil? I dont know.\nSigns and wonders? Choices, choices!\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nDream of graphs that rise like mountains\nsettle for a slight plateau.\nIts all downhill; the lift is broken.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nFireworks and a beer-soaked picnic,\nAuld Lang Syne, hung mistletoe.\nSame old headache in the morning.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nThis bunnys not a mere digression,\na rude eruption of the flow\nleading to your shows resumption.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nPick a designated driver.\nUse protection. No means no.\nThis is the blood ofChrist, go figure.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nAnother loophole in the system.\nBombs explode. Volcanoes glow.\nMarkets plunge. There goes the weekend.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\n\n\nThat pink-furred prick is always drumming,\npushing onward, to-and-fro.\nMene mene tekel upharsin.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe. \n\nI have long admired this humorous poem by a contemporary poet known for having a \nbit of an edge.\n\n\n\r\n\r\nSmall Child\r\nby Vera \nIgnatowitsch\n\nSmall child\r\nwith my eyes\r\nreturn my heart before you wander.\r\n\r\nTake the jewels.\r\nI wish you plenty. \r\nPlace a flowers petals gently.\r\nBreak a toy but not intently.\r\n\r\nSing once\r\nthrough my eyes,\r\ncalmest cataclysm of passion;\r\nonly please return my heart\r\nbefore you wander,\r\nthough I could not bear to accept it,\r\n\r\nsmall child\r\nwith my eyes.\r\n\n\n\n\nAdvice for Winston\nby Tom Merrill\n\nWhy not just impose the old Zurich curfew,\ndrive everyone indoors early, arrest\nanyone caught in the street past eleven.\n\nSurely that would bring to an end\nall disapproved transactions\nconducted in the blind of night\n\nas well as providing a superabundance\nof quietude, a lullaby\nfor the fierce upholders of right.\n\nMaybe you\'ve never been approached\nby someone peddling forbidden fruit\nand felt glad the option was there,\n\nbut far better they, any day, I\'d say\nthan heaven\'s unleashed hounds\naccosting anyone they please\n\nwith gratuitous curiosities.\nDo you really want to live that way?\nAnd now with all the good people\n\nbeing asked to spy on everyone else\nand supplement the force, Winston,\nmake yourself thin, shrink\n\nout of the screen\'s wide eye,\nit\'s a quarter century ago,\nand so,\n\n1984, here we come.\n\nTom Merrill is equally adept at formal and free verse. The poem above has long \nbeen one of my favorites of his. Merrill has no patience with people who insist \non imposing their morals on other people who aren\'t hurting anyone, but just \nseeking pleasure in their own way. Prohibition didn\'t work and just made things \nworse. Ditto for the so-called war on drugs. Why not fire Big Brother? But \nheavens unleashed hounds have a way of imposing their will on the masses. \n\n\n\n\nSnow\nby Rhina \nP. Espaillat \n\nDeception underfoot,\ndeception on the bough:\nit covers bud and root\nto state the naked now\n\nas the full-flowered tree\nwould charm this out of mind.\nAll presence seems to be\ndeception of a kind.\n\n\n\nWilly Nilly\nby\nMichael R. Burch\n\nfor the Demiurge aka Yahweh/Jehovah\n\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the \ndark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days \nuphilly.\nThey ran till they dropped\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nThey say I should worship you!\nOh, really!\nThey say I should pray\nso youll not act illy.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\nWhile some aspiring intellectuals might turn up their noses at this poem of \nmine, sniffing and calling it doggerel, I think it makes a point similar to \nTom Merrill\'s, in a humorous way. If God is all-loving, all-wise and all-just, \nwhy do people have to pray so diligently to him not to act unlovingly, unwisely \nand unjustly?\n\n\n\nPart 6 from The Dark Side of the Deity: Interlude\nby\n\nJoe M. Ruggier\n\nWhen Satan hurled, before the Dawn,\ndefiance at the Lord of History;\nand Michael stood, and Glory shone,\nWhose hand controlled the timeless Mystery?\nWho but the Insult was the leveler;\nDeliverer and bedeviler?\n\nWhen Athens, sung in verse and prose,\ncaught all the World\'s imagination;\nwhen Ilion fell, and Rome arose,\nand Time went on like pagination:\n Who but the Insult was the leveler;\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\n\nWhen books, in numberless infinities,\ncross-fertilize the teeming brain,\nand warring, vex the Soul with Vanities,\n and Insults hurtle, Insults rain:\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\n\nAnd when we too shall cease to be,\n like all the Kingdoms of the Past,\nand groaning, gasping, wrenching free,\n we bite, at last, alone, the dust:\n Who but the Insult is the leveler;\n Deliverer and bedeviler?\n\nWhen churchbells fill the wandering fields\n  with Love and Fear,\nthe Flesh and Blood of Jesus yields\n  deliverance dear,\nto them who believe in the Compliment Sinsear.\n\nJoe Ruggier is quite a story, having sold over 20,000 books by going \ndoor-to-door. He is a Maltese poet who now lives in British Columbia.\n\n\n\nThe Poem of Poems\nby Greg Alan Brownderville\n\nA boy passes ghost-like through a curtain of weeping willow.\nIn rainbow-stained apparel, birds are singing a cappella.\nSuddenly I sense it, in the birds and in the child:\nThe world is a poem growing wild.\n\nA dewdrop on a blade of grass soon slips from where it clung\nLike a perfect word that gathers on the tip of a poet\'s tongue.\nAnd men are merely characters to love and be defiled.\nGod is a poem growing wild.\n\nThis is a fine contemporary poem in the mystic tradition of Blake and Whitman. \nJack Butler and Greg Brownderville are both "Arkansas" boys . . . there must be \nsomething in the water down there, or perhaps it\'s in the mayhaw jelly.\n\n\n\r\nThe Tally\r\nby Hafiz\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLovers\r\ndon\'t reveal\r\nall\r\ntheir Secrets;\r\nunder the covers\r\nthey\r\nmay\r\ncount each other\'s Moles\r\n(that reside\r\nand hide\r\nin the shy regions\r\nby forbidden holes),\r\nthen keep final tally\r\nstrictly\r\nfrom Aunt Sally!\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly a very \r\nloose translation of the original Hafiz poem!\r\n\r\n\n\n\nCompass Rose\nby Jennifer Reeser\n\nI\'d buy you a Babushka doll, my heart,\nand brush your ash-blonde hair until it gleams,\nwere Russia and our land not laid apart\nby ocean so much deeper than it seems.\n\nI have an oval pin, thoughglossy lacquer\nhand-made in Moscow, after glasnost came,\nwith fine, deft roses on a background blacker\nperhaps, than history\'s collective shame.\n\nI\'ve done my best to compass you with roses:\nthe tablecloth, the walls, the pillowcase,\nthe western side-yard only dusk discloses\nbriefly, in Climbing Blaze and Queen Anne\'s lace.\n\nMay they suffice for peace when you discover\nyour love is not enough to turn the earth.\nI dream I saw a handful of them hover\nagainst my pane the morning of your birth.\n\nJennifer Reeser is a contemporary poet with a romantic bent, which in our book \nis a very good thing when the poetry is well-executed, as her poem above so \nobviously is. Jennifer lives in Louisiana where she writes poetry, ghost stories, \nand sometimes even poetic ghost stories of the epic variety, such as her latest \nbook, an Amazon poetry bestseller, \n\nThe Lalaurie Horror.\n\n\n\nMadame LaBouche\nby Tom Merrill\n\nHer ears pricked up so much, Madame\nLaBouche, decrying all disturbance\nInsisted sounds around be less\nCity-like and more suburban.\n\nOne bistro gave Madame no rest\nUntil it was at last subdued,\nAnd vexed by yakky cabbies next,\nShe finally got their stand removed.\n\nYet still, some night-owl might abort\nThe dreamshift of LaBouche\'s week,\nAnd pop her prized unconsciousness\nBy passing with a piercing shriek,\n\nOr other nuisances emerge\nBut when, for my part, out a window\nI spot Madame surveying things,\nHard eye a-gleam, arms set akimbo\n\nAll poised to nail some passerby\nWith shrill bursts from her magic flute\nI see the sole noisemaker I\nHave lately dreamed of going mute.\n\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets. Like Ann Drysdale, he has \na keen eye for detail and a wonderful sense of irony. He also has something of a \nSwiftian loathing for fools and hypocrites (especially the "Christian" kind, \nwho often seem more concerned about other people\'s morals than their own).\n\n\n\nHow Long the Night (anonymous Old English Lyric, circa early 13th century AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIt is pleasant, indeed, while the summer lasts\nwith the mild pheasants\' song ...\nbut now I feel the northern wind\'s blast\nits severe weather strong.\nAlas! Alas! This night seems so long!\nAnd I, because of my momentous wrong\nnow grieve, mourn and fast.\n\nI did a bit of fine-tuning on the meter of this poem, and I\'m glad I did. It \nstrikes me as a strong poem: one of the very best short lyrics in the early \nEnglish stable.\n\n\n\nThe Skeleton\'s Defense of Carnality\nby Jack Foley\n\nTruly I have lost weight, I have lost weight,\ngrown lean in loves defense,\nin loves defense grown grave.\nIt was concupiscence that brought me to the state:\nall bone and a bit of skin\nto keep the bone within.\nFlesh is no heavy burden for one possessed of little\nand accustomed to its loss.\nI lean to love, which leaves me lean, till lean turn into lack.\nA wanton bone, I sing my song\nand travel where the bone is blown\nand extricate true love from lust\nas any man of wisdom must.\nThen wherefore should I rage\nagainst this pilgrimage\nfrom gravel unto gravel?\nCircuitous I travel\nfrom love to lack / and lack to lack,\nfrom lean to lack\nand back.\n\nI love this wicked little poem by the contemporary poet Jack Foley. The male \nskeleton is missing an important "member" required for lovemaking, so "lean" \nreally does "turn into lack" when the "bone is blown."\n\n\n\nN. W.\nby Robert Mezey\n\nOn a certain street there is a certain door,\nUnyielding, around which rockroses rise,\nCharged with the scent of a lost paradise,\nWhich in the evening sunlight opens no more,\nOr not to me. Once, in a better light,\nDearly awaited arms would wait for me\nAnd in the impatient fading of the day\nThe joy and peace of the embracing night.\nNo more of that. Now, a day breaks and dies,\nReleasing empty hours and impure\nFantasies, and the abuse of literature,\nThe lawless images and artful lies,\nAnd pointless tears, and the envy of other men.\nAnd then the longing for oblivion.\n after Borges\n\nThis is a wonderful poem about loss, by a contemporary poet.\n\n\n\nEvening Wind\nby Robert Mezey\n\nOne foot on the floor, one knee in bed,\nBent forward on both hands as if to leap\nInto a heaven of silken cloud, or keep\nAn old appointmenttryst, one almost said\nSome promise, some entanglement that led\nIn broad daylight to privacy and sleep,\nTo dreams of love, the rapture of the deep,\nOh, everything, that must be left unsaid\n\nWhy then does she suddenly look aside\nAt a white window full of empty space\nAnd curtains swaying inward? Does she sense\nIn darkening air the vast indifference\nThat enters in and will not be denied\nTo breathe unseen upon her nakedness?\n\nafter an etching by Edward Hopper\n\nAlthough I haven\'t seen the etching by Hopper, the poem is so wonderfully \ndescriptive it paints a picture that stands by itself.\n\n\n\nfrom  Word from the Hills\na sonnet sequence in four movements\nby Richard Moore\n\n11\nYou were so solid, father, cold and raw\nas these north winters, where your angry will\nfirst hardened, as the earth when the long chill\ndeepensas is this country\'s cruel law\nyet under trackless snow, without a flaw\ncovering meadow, road, and stubbled hill,\nthe springs and muffled streams were running still,\ndark until spring came, and the awful thaw.\nIn your decay a gentleness appears\nI hadn\'t guessedwhen, gray as rotting snow,\npropped in your chair, your face will run with tears,\ntrying to speak, and your hand, stiff and slow,\nwill touch my childwho, sensing the cold years\nin your eyes, cries until you let her go.\n\nThis poem by the contemporary poet Richard Moore about his father and daughter \nproves that real life can be darker and more frightening than any horror story.\n\n\n\nDu\nby Janet Kenny\n\nA wisp of old woman,\ncurved like a scythe,\ntottered to me as she\nfussed her shopping,\nher walking stick hooked\non her chopstick wrist.\n\nShe spoke to me then\nin a dried leaf voice.\nInaudible there\nin that busy street,\nswept by rude gales\nfrom passing trucks.\n\nI leaned closer to hear:\nMein eyes not gut.\ntime for bus, ven comes it?\nWhich bus do you want?\n\nShe smiled, shook her head\nthen sang to herself\nand somebody else,\ninnot German. Yiddish?\nWhich bus?\nShe leaned towards me,\nher tiny claw reached\nto stroke my face.\nDu she said.\n\nDu\n\nThis is a wonderful bit of storytelling by a contemporary poet. "Du" is the \nmore intimate German word for "you, so the elderly woman seems to be greeting \nthe poet more like a long-lost friend or family member than as a stranger.\n\n\nSay, Shantih\nby\nPhilip Quinlan\n\nfor Paul Christian Stevens\n\nThese latitudes are falsified;\nwrecked deadening has done for us.\n\nWe compass the meridian,\nbut who will stop the sun for us?\n\nOur sextant-blinded eyes bleed brine;\nno times or tides still stay for us.\n\nAll sheets, all shrouds are cut and dried;\nour cleats cannot belay for us.\n\nIn sympathy at distances:\nwe navigate by hunger, thirst.\n\nNoon shadows say our will be last.\nShall stern or bow go under first?\n\nWe cross the line with rituals:\ntraversal which will be reversed.\n\nWell Easter home at empty sail,\nour mark be missed. We fare the worst.\n\nGood Friday, 2013\n\nThis is a remarkable elegy by Philip Quinlan to his friend and fellow poet \nPaul Christian Stevens.\n\n\n\nThe Death of a Toad\nby Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep \nmonotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard \ndaylight steer.\n\nI cant remember where or when I first read "The Death of a Toad," but \nthe poem haunted me until I finally rediscovered it many years later, while flipping through \nthe pages of a poetry anthology in a Nashville bookstore. I had forgotten the poem\'s title \nand its poet\'s name, but I had never been able to forget its words\' magic. \nI believe Richard Wilbur made himself immortal with this one.\n\n\n\nBread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\n\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nIn his best poems\nConrad Aiken rivals W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane as \nmasters of modern English poetic meter. Aiken\'s "Bread and Music" is one of my \nfavorite poems, regardless of era.\n\n\n\nThe Forge\nby Seamus Heaney\n\nAll I know is a door into the dark.\nOutside, old axles and iron hoops rusting;\nInside, the hammered anvils short-pitched ring,\nThe unpredictable fantail of sparks\nOr hiss when a new shoe toughens in water.\nThe anvil must be somewhere in the centre,\nHorned as a unicorn, at one end and square,\nSet there immoveable: an altar\nWhere he expends himself in shape and music.\nSometimes, leather-aproned, hairs in his nose,\nHe leans out on the jamb, recalls a clatter\nOf hoofs where traffic is flashing in rows;\nThen grunts and goes in, with a slam and flick\nTo beat real iron out, to work the bellows.\n\nWhen I first created The HyperTexts, more than two decades ago, this \nwas one of the two poems that I chose for the frontispiece. \n\n\n\nSarabande on Attaining the Age of Seventy-Seven\nby Anthony Hecht\n\nThe harbingers are come. See, see their mark;\nWhite is their colour; and behold my head.\nGeorge Herbert \n\nLong gone the smoke-and-pepper childhood smell\nOf the smoldering immolation of the year,\nLeaf-strewn in scattered grandeur where it fell,\nGolden and poxed with frost, tarnished and sere.\n\nAnd I myself have whitened in the weathers\nOf heaped-up Januaries as they bequeath\nThe annual rings and wrongs that wring my withers,\nSober my thoughts, and undermine my teeth.\n\nThe dramatis personae of our lives\nDwindle and wizen; familiar boyhood shames,\nThe tribulations one somehow survives,\nRise smokily from propitiatory flames\n\nOf our forgetfulness until we find\nIt becomes strangely easy to forgive\nEven ourselves with this clouding of the mind,\nThis cinerous blur and smudge in which we live.\n\nA turn, a glide, a quarter turn and bow,\nThe stately dance advances; these are airs\nBone-deep and numbing as I should know by now,\nDiminishing the cast, like musical chairs.\n\nHecht\'s poem makes aging seem like sitting in a foxhole, waiting for the \ninevitable end, but with the somewhat hopeful note that "it becomes strangely easy to forgive \n/ even ourselves with this clouding of the mind, / this cinerous blur and smudge in which we live." \nShould we thank God, perhaps, for small favors, like eroding memories?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Freeze\n\n\nby Richard Moore\n\nThe deep cold comes, and even the great\npond is frozen, dusted with snow,\nluminous under Venus, the moon,\nsuburban lights on the dark hills.\n\nThe cold wind has blown over and over\nit, and now it is still, my mind,\nfrozen, determined, and still the wind\nshrieks. Let there be no end of it.\n\n\n\nMemory of My Father\nby Eunice de Chazeau\n\nStanding ankle deep in this black river\nsilted with death, I feel the rush of it\nlike chains and the cold of it like a collar\nof locked iron. I look to the mid-stream lit\nonly by the pallor of your face that flows\nmost terribly away; but no lament\nis uttered across the water that will close\nsecretly over you when you are spent.\n\nYou, who were always a strong swimmer, would dive,\nabhorring the gradual, and skim below\nthe ripple, while I gasped for fear you would never\ncome up. Then, like a seal, you would break above\nthe surface and I would breathe.Sinking now\nwill you be able to hold your breath forever?\n\nThis is the first of three poems by Eunice de Chazeau about her mother and \nfather. Sometimes reading a good poem is like reading a highly condensed novel. \nI believe this is one such poem.\n\n\n\nMemory of My Mother\nby Eunice de Chazeau\n\nShe saw him, knew, and waited for a year\nthat he should ask; then gave her perishable body\nwithout vanity. Leaving the rectangular\ntown and reassurance of deep sod, she\nfollowed him where crag and glacier\nstab the sun, and rivers plunging flay\ntheir stones.She lay beside him on sand, her\ndreams unsheltered from the Milky Way.\n\nHad she known how quickly days would spill\ntheir splendor, only dregs of time be left\nhad she known how at last, and by his will,\nher ashes and bones would be strewn to drift\nwith his in troughs of ocean, nevertheless,\neyes wide with fear, she would have answered yes.\n\nThere is an interesting interplay of horror and human courage in this poem. If \nwe knew that love would lead us to be bits of ashes and bones strewn in the \ntroughs of an ocean, would we be able to answer, "yes"? A possible consolation \nmight be producing a child able to write such poems.\n\n\n\nMan of Many Clocks\nby Eunice de Chazeau\n\nHe chose them for a chime\nor possibly a face.\nOnce a whispering chain\nwon him. He loved their gears\nand the intricate brass\nof their interiors.\n\nHe had a leaning toward\nthe elaborate, often\napproving one that wore\na porcelain festoon\nof fruitsand flowers or took\nan interest in the moon.\n\nHe never asked the hour,\nit being always there;\na syncopated shower\nof tickings, whirrs and tocks\nto be amonga small\neternity of clocks.\n\nFor some reason, this poem makes me think of Einstein, who worked on his \nequations about the relativity of time and other such peculiar things, even on his \ndeathbed.\n\n\n\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat would Santa Claus say,\nI wonder,\nabout Jesus returning\nto kill and plunder?\nFor Hell likely return\non Christmas day\nto blow the bad\nlittle boys away!\nWhen He flashes like lightning\nacross the skies\nand many a homosexual\ndies,\nwhen the harlots and heretics\nare ripped asunder,\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\nI wonder?\n\nI can\'t help liking my little anti-Christianity rant. Why do Christians \nendlessly praise a being who (according to them) is so petty he\'ll return to \nearth to destroy everyone who doesn\'t "believe" in him, then send them to an \n"eternal hell," even though he was either unable or unwilling to speak \nto them personally? Why should anyone "believe" in such a petty, cruel \nmonster? If we are going to believe in Invisible Friends, why not at least believe in \nbeings of grace, like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny?\n\n\n\nWord Made Flesh\nby Ann Drysdale\n\nOn the broad steps of the Basilica\nThe feckless hopefully hold out their hands,\nOften with some success; the privileged\nLighten their consciences by a few pence\nOn their way to receive the sacrament.\n\nOn the seventeenth step two beggars sit\nPaying no regard to the worshippers\nWho file past on their way to salvation.\nThey do not ask for alms. They are engrossed,\nSkillfully masturbating one another.\n\nMost who have noticed this pretend they havent;\nSome of the other beggars wish they wouldnt.\nPoor relief is incumbent on the rich\nAnd by taking things into their own hands\nThey spoil the scene for everybody else.\n\nOur Lord said, silver and gold have I none\nBut such as I have give I thee. The words\nAre here made flesh; with beatific sigh\nOne gives the other benison, slipping\nAll that he has into the waiting hand\nOf somebody who shares his human need.\n\nThe newly shriven filter down the steps\nAverting their eyes from the seventeenth,\nWhere the first beggar, in a state of grace,\nWorks selflessly towards the second coming.\n\nI absolutely love Ann Drysdale\'s poem. If only there was a God whose grace \nextended to beggars masturbating each other on the steps of a \nBasilica! But then what use would there be for the hellfire-and-brimstone \ncondemners of humankind?\n\n\n\n\nLeitmotif\n\nby Tom Merrill\n\nThe eye is turned inward these days,\naway from the gloom in the glass,\nthe window\'s vacancy,\n\nthe desolate picture left in the wake\nof the latest revanchist crusade\nto restore a compliant past.\n\nFacing the remains, an imposed deprivation,\nsaddled with a heftier load of time,\none begins to make adjustments,\n\nresorts to creating distractions\nlike this very problem I\'m solving now,\nwhose unyielding grip on the mind\n\nwon\'t be shaken until it\'s fully resolved.\nThe social regime of rural religion\nleaves one in a doctor\'s waiting room\n\nand makes absorption in such problems\nuseful in diverting\nconsciousness from the creeping clock.\n\nSo the eye is turned inward these days,\nturned inward because it has to be,\nthough a few staunch rebels\n\nstill lingering out there like sitting ducks\nensure that even now\nironically embellishing seats of wisdom\n\nwith inspired masterstrokes relieves,\na little at least, one\'s awareness the doctor\nis seeing countless other patients first,\n\nlike that always too-busy god for which they wait.\n\nTom Merrill in an atheist who isn\'t fond of loudly clanging church bells and \nbusybody moralizers. And really, if the biblical God were a physician, wouldn\'t \nwe have called him a quack and fired him by now? \n\n\n\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Boy Scout\n\nby Rob Griffith \n\n Gilwell Park, London\n\nA colleague mentioned it at lunch, was sure\nshe had it right. A cenotaph. Yes.\nOr maybe just a grave. She stirred her soup.\nA small brick plinth, about waist-high and topped\nwithsomething. A buffalo! In bronze, I think.\nShe waved her bread knife, its tip still smeared \nwith butter, and left me wondering why \ntheyd bury Boy Scouts in a London park.\nSome sort of sacrifice to Boy Scout gods?\n\nPerhaps, like Incas, they hollowed out a hill\nthen threw their victim in and walled him up.\nAnd in this barrow filled with midnight,\nthe boy would grip his knees and tremble,\ndisturbing piles of pinewood derby cars,\nsome books on tying knots, and merit badges\nstrewn about like wafers from the Eucharist.\n\nOr maybe its a shrine to all those boys \nwho bled for England. In fen-felled keeps,\nin drafty great halls packed now with tourists,\ntapestries shiver on the walls. And there, picked out\nin ochre, gold, and green, long-legged Crusaders\nmarch through wastes, their warhead helms pulled low,\ntheir leather armor creaking in the mind.\nBut if you look more closely, youll see him,\na lone Boy Scout in neckerchief and olive shorts.\nHe stands among those grim-eyed men-at-arms\nand smiles, his apple cheeks cross-stitched in red.\n\nBut maybe thats too early. There are other wars,\nof course. I hold a dog-eared black and white,\nand in the frame a group of doughboys cringe\nagainst their mud-gut trench. Their eyes are closed,\nso they dont see the flare, dont see the boy\nwho stands amid the sludge in kneesocks and stares\nat the eldritch light. His mouth a perfect O,\nhe might be singing campfire songs. He might.\n\n\n\nMeditation in the Woods\nby Don Thackrey\n\nHe walks into the woods to meditate\nOn Fall and what it presages for him\nAs Summer\'s candles flare and immolate\nThemselves, then sputter feebly as they dim.\n\nHe listens to the whispering of leaves\nRehearsing striking colors in surrender,\nThen notes a wheeling hawk that screams and grieves\nTo mock the season\'s bold deceits of splendor;\n\nFor soon enough the woods, the hawk, and he\nWill crowd together in the whited vault\nThat Fall constructs each year for life\'s debris.\nWith rue he ponders how Mankind\'s first fault\n\nBrought Death into the World, and all our woe . . .\nBut darkling thrush and dancing daffodil:\nAre they to be in thrall to debts we owe,\nMust everything that lives endure Fall\'s chill?\n\nHe asked forgiveness of the woods and bird . . .\nBut if they answered him, we haven\'t heard.\n\nDon Thackrey spent his formative years on farms and ranches of the Nebraska Sandhills before \nmodern conveniences, and much of his verse reflects that experience. He now \nlives in Dexter, Michigan, where he is retired from the University of Michigan. \nHis verse has appeared in a number of journals and anthologies. His prose \nincludes a book on Emily Dickinson.A volume of his verse is forthcoming from \nthe Dakota Institute Press. \n\n\n\nEpitaph for a Palestinian Child\nby\nMichael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nI suppose I shouldn\'t publish my own poems on such an auspicious page, but what \nthe hell: I think this one deserves to be read and considered. Christians and \nJews need to understand that when they do things that cause Muslim children to \nsuffer and die, the "golden rule" can come back to pursue them like an avenging \ndemon. What happens when we talk the talk, but don\'t walk the walk, and innocent \nwomen and children suffer and die as a result? Terrible things like 9-11 and \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Why? Because Muslim men love and want to protect \ntheir women and children, just as Christian and Jewish men love and want to \nprotect their women and children. Until we understand this elemental truth, and \nrespect and honor it, we are doomed to repeat the errors of the past, which \nalways begin with with "chosen few" practicing injustices against their \n"inferiors," who quite understandably never agree with the beliefs of their "superiors."\n\n\n\nSpring Fever\nby Tom Merrill\n\nThe current outlook has started me brooding,\nasking myself as I writhe in my box\nhow many long stretches more\n\nshould be left to chance, to whatever\ncommon treacheries still lie in store.\nOf course,\n\nbetween decidedly wishful\nenlistments of any chore or bore,\nthere\'s scenery galore,\n\njust oodles of riveting decoration\nto help expel the daily prospect\nof sluggish passage through a void\n\nand expand the rescue team of vital\nthings like this still left to be done.\nRight now it\'s springtime again,\n\nand a week or two ago while pacing\nthe space between uneasy escapes,\nI must\'ve paused to check the view,\n\na proscenium arch of chartreuse leaves\ndisclosing an anemic row\nof daffodils over across in the park,\n\nall which might\'ve seemed less deja vu\nhad the politicos ordered a headstone or two\nto cap off their visionary landscape art.\n\nIn the meantime, the scene\'s turned green,\nand I note the hanging half-wreath is capturing\na bloomless bed\'s gray edging of cobbles,\n\nso I guess that brand of granite instead\nmust serve to show how a dream of beauty\ncan produce so engrossing a land of the dead.\n\nWell, don\'t expect anything great.\nIt\'s just a way of knocking off\nanother block of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of Iran and Israel\nby \nZyskandar A.

maturity.\n\nAll these primary impulses,\nnot easily described in words,\nare the springboards\nof man\'s actionsbecause\nany man who can drive safely\nwhile kissing a pretty girl\nis simply not giving the kiss\nthe attention it deserves!\n\nOh, it should be possible\nto explain the laws of physics\nto a barmaid! . . .\nbut how could she ever explain,\nin a million years,\nlove\nto an Einstein?\n\nNow it gives me great pleasure, indeed,\nto see the stubbornness\nof an incorrigible nonconformist\nso warmly acclaimed . . .\nand yet\nit seems vastly strange\nto be known so universally\nand yet be so lonely.\n\nStill, as far as I\'m concerned,\nI prefer silent vice\nto ostentatious virtue:\nI don\'t know,\nI don\'t care,\nand it doesn\'t make any difference!\n\nBut heroism on command,\nsenseless violence,\nand all the loathsome nonsense\nthat goes by the name of patriotism:\nhow passionately I hate them!\nPerfection of means\nand confusion of ends\nseem to characterize our age\nand it has become appallingly obvious\nthat our technology\nhas exceeded our humanity,\nthat technological progress\nis like an axe \nin the hands of a pathological criminal,\nand that the attempt to combine wisdom \nand power\nhas only rarely been successful\nand then only for a short while.\n\nIt is my conviction\nthat killing under the cloak of war\nis nothing but an act of murder.\n(I do not know what weapons\nWorld War III will be fought with,\nbut World War IV will be fought\nwith sticks and stones.)\n\nOh, how I wish that \nsomewhere \nthere existed an island \n\nfor those who are wise \n\nand of goodwill! . . .\n\nIn such a place even I\nwould be an ardent patriot,\nfor I am not only a pacifist,\nbut a militant pacifist.\nI am willing to fight for peace,\nfor nothing will end war\nunless the people themselves\nrefuse to go to war.\n\nOur task must be to free ourselves\nby widening our circle of compassion\nto embrace all living creatures\nand the whole of nature and its beauty.\nAnd peace cannot be kept by force;\nit can only be achieved by understanding.\n\nI believe that a simple\nand unassuming\nmanner of life\nis best for

to mine, entrusting charms\nMy whole youth\'s starward longing could not win;\nWith still the murmur of your love in me,\nMiracle-tones of all my lifelong hope,\nI wished that there might start eternity\nAnd seal forever that sweet envelope;\nAnd as it did, my thoughts are now for you\nAs every star is blotted by the sun,\nAnd so the sun itself\nHas perished too,\nAnd with it, every dream of mine\nBut one.\n\nThis is a wonderfully tender poem about love, loss and loneliness.\n\n\n\nA Proof of Love\nby\n\nJoe M.

Usually we just stare at the rooks,\nand he sips my beer without asking, then looks\nderanged as if to say he\'s sorry. He knows enough\nabout me to know I like diamonds in the rough.\nAnd, strangely, he and I always notice the same things:\nhieroglyphs in the snow, tiny holes in our fillings.\nWhen he\'s not around, my wife says he\'s a blackguard\nand a parasite, a charlatan, and a drunkard;\nand I try to explain that he\'s just the village idiot,\nand that once in a while it\'s necessary to sit\nwith him and share a pint. Later, when she falls asleep,\nout of pity and out of love, I allow him to sneak\ninto her bed and fondle her thin white thighs,\nand, if she doesn\'t protest, to spend the night.\n\nMany of the best poems tell stories, and this poem tells a compelling story with nice touches of compassion and irony.\n\n\n\nForgive, O Lord\nby Robert Frost\n\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\n\nI believe Robert Frost harbored similar doubts, reservations, disillusionments, \netc., about God. His poem "Directive," which appears later on this page, \nvividly illustrates the horror of children growing up under the thumb of the \nhorribly unjust religion called "Christianity," whose God predestines the "chosen few" for "eternal glory" and the rest of suffering \nhumanity to be piss-pots ("vessels of destruction") and "chaff" fit only for an "eternal hell."\n\n\n\nIt takes courage to push yourself to places that you have never been before, to \ntest your limits, to break through barriers. And the day came when the risk it \ntook to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to \nblossom.\nAna\xefs Nin\n\n\n\nExcerpts from "More Poems," XXXVI\n\nby A. E. Housman\n\nHere dead lie we because we did not choose\nTo live and shame the land from which we sprung.\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;\nBut young men think it is, and we were young.\n\nThe poem above was the first ever to appear on the pages of The HyperTexts. \nI believe Housman\'s lines disprove many of the modern mantras that \nseem to accompany poetry the way dark clouds accompany lightning: "no ideas but in things," "make \nit new (because normal speech is \'unoriginal\' and the poetic tradition is toast)," "rhyme is pass\xe9," "meter is pass\xe9," \n"the perfect poem is silence," etc. But Housman\'s lines also disprove certain ancient dogmas about poetry as \nwell, such as the one about metaphor being the be-all and end-all of poetry. \nHousman, like Shakespeare, was a master of direct statement. The great soliloquies \nof Hamlet are not metaphors  but abstract examinations of the human condition, from the perspective of \nthe ego. Poetry is the realm of the abstract as well as the concrete, and of all \nforms of speech from plainspoken directness to surrealistic phantasmagoria. Great poets can pull off almost anything, and make readers \nglad they did. So as you read the poems on this page, please feel free to \nlean back, relax and escape the tedium of theories about poetry, for \nthe true joys of the most en-chant-ing of the Muses.\n\n\n\nThe births of all things are weak and tender,\ntherefore we should have our eyes intent on beginnings.\nMichel de Montaigne\n\n\n\nCradle Song\nby William Blake\n\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\nDreaming in the joys of night;\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\n\nSweet babe, in thy face\nSoft desires I can trace,\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\n\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\nSmiles as of the morning steal\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\n\nO the cunning wiles that creep\nIn thy little heart asleep!\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\n\nIf there\'s a single poet who influences me personally, it\'s William Blake. Years \nago I chose to join his "mental fight" against the Satanic Mills of organized \ntyranny: church and state, if you will. While Auden opined that poetry makes \nnothing happen, I disagree. Poets like Blake and Walt Whitman made all sorts of \ngood and interesting things happen, by appealing to the compassion and reason of \ntheir readers. Soon after Blake wrote his wonderfully moving poems about the \nmiseries suffered by child chimneysweeps, the Western nations began to enact child labor laws. \nToday most children in the West are protected from ruthless businessmen rather than enslaved, \nso there has been real progress. Much of that progress was instigated and propelled by reformer \nprophet-poets like Blake and Whitman and their heirs among singer-songwriters \nlike Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and John Lennon. Poetry, it seems to me, makes \neverything happen, in the realms of compassion and social justice.\n\n\n\nLullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermits carnal ecstacy.\n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\nAnd it seems to me that Auden\'s poetry also makes many good things happen. It\'s \ninteresting that poets as different as Blake and Auden wrote two of the most \nwonderfully tender lullabies in the English language: one for a baby, one for a \nlover.\n\n\n\nPiano\nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nWhile Modernism sometimes makes a fetish out of imagism, this \npoem shows how effectively images can be used in the hands of a genius who is \nalso a skilled craftsman. It\'s hard to imagine a more perfectly drawn or more \nmoving poem.\n\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To )\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\nAnd it\'s hard to imagine a poem in which the sounds could fit the sense any better. \nLike other of the great Romantics, Shelley died young. We can only imagine \nwhat he might have accomplished if he had lived longer, but then it\'s hard to \nimagine a more perfect poem than this one.\n\n\n\nThe Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nThe time of year has grown indifferent.\nMildew of summer and the deepening snow\nAre both alike in the routine I know:\nI am too dumbly in my being pent.\n\nThe wind attendant on the solstices\nBlows on the shutters of the metropoles,\nStirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls\nThe grand ideas of the villages.\n\nThe malady of the quotidian . . .\nPerhaps if summer ever came to rest\nAnd lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed\nThrough days like oceans in obsidian\n\nHorizons, full of night\'s midsummer blaze;\nPerhaps, if winter once could penetrate\nThrough all its purples to the final slate,\nPersisting bleakly in an icy haze;\n\nOne might in turn become less diffident,\nOut of such mildew plucking neater mould\nAnd spouting new orations of the cold.\nOne might. One might. But time will not relent.\n\nWallace Stevens is a wonder, and an enigma. It\'s hard to say what he believed, \nif he believed anything. Like another famous W. S., he seems somehow subsumed in \nhis work. But regardless of what he believed, or didn\'t, he wrote some of the \nmost gorgeous poems of the modern era.\n\n\n\nThe Old Lutheran Bells at Home\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nThese are the voices of the pastors calling\nIn the names of St. Paul and of the halo-John\nAnd of other holy and learned men, among them\n\nGreat choristers, propounders of hymns, trumpeters,\nJerome and the scrupulous Francis and Sunday women,\nThe nurses of the spirit\'s innocence.\n\nThese are the voices of the pastors calling\nMuch rough-end being to smooth Paradise,\nSpreading out fortress walls like fortress wings.\n\nDeep in their sound the stentor Martin sings.\nDark Juan looks outward through his mystic brow . . .\nEach sexton has his sect. The bells have none.\n\nThese are the voices of the pastors calling\nAnd calling like the long echoes in long sleep,\nGenerations of shepherds to generations of sheep.\n\nEach truth is a sect though no bells ring for it.\nAnd the bells belong to the sextons, after all,\nAs they jangle and dangle and kick their feet.\n\nI love the last stanza of this poem, which makes it sounds as if the sexton have \nlost control and are being swung about by the bells, having become human \nclappers.\n\n\n\nNon sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\nby Ernest Dowson\n\n"I am not as I was under the reign of the good Cynara"Horace\n\nLast night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine\n\nThere fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed\nUpon my soul between the kisses and the wine;\nAnd I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, I was desolate and bowed my head:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nAll night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,\nNight-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;\nSurely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nWhen I awoke and found the dawn was gray:\nI have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion.\n \n\nI have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,\nFlung roses, roses riotously with the throng,\nDancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;\nBut I was desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, all the time, because the dance was long;\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n \n\nI cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\nBut when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,\nThen falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;\nAnd I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\nYea, hungry for the lips of my desire:\nI have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.\n\nErnest Dowson wrote a small handful of poems that are among the strongest in the \nEnglish language. I consider him one of the very best "unknown" or \n"under-known" major poets, along with Louise Bogan. The poem above should make \nhim forever immortal, unless readers lose their ears and their senses.\n\n\n\nSong\nby John Donne\n\nGo and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,\nTell me where all past years are,\nOr who cleft the devils foot;\nTeach me to hear mermaids singing,\nOr to keep off envy\'s stinging,\nAnd find\nWhat wind\nServes to advance an honest mind.\n\nIf thou be\'st born to strange sights,\nThings invisible to see,\nRide ten thousand days and nights\nTill Age snow white hairs on thee;\nThou, when thou return\'st wilt tell me\nAll strange wonders that befell thee,\nAnd swear\nNo where\nLives a woman true and fair.\n\nIf thou find\'st one let me know;\nSuch a pilgrimage were sweet.\nYet do not; I would not go,\nThough at next door we might meet.\nThough she were true when you met her,\nAnd last, till you write your letter,\nYet she\nWill be\nFalse, ere I come, to two or three.\n\nJohn Donne was something of an enigma: perhaps the greatest sensualist since \nSolomon, yet perhaps the greatest preacher (also since Solomon). Paul Simon\'s lyric "I \nam a Rock, I am an Island" seems to have been written to refute Donne\'s \nfamous sermon "No Man is an Island." Was Donne the reincarnation of Solomon: a \nhedonistic non-believer making a living as a preacher? If there\'s a heaven \nperhaps one day such mysteries will be revealed.\n\n\n\nDulce Et Decorum Est\nby Wilfred Owen\n\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind;\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.\n\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling,\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime...\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin;\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\nPro patria mori.\n\n"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" appears in Horace\'s Odes. \nThe "old lie" means:  "It is sweet and fitting\nto die for one\'s country." Wilfred Owen stands at the vanguard of the great \nanti-war poets and singer-songwriters. "Dulce Et Decorum Est" may be the most \nimportant poem in the English language: one that eventually leads to the \nabolition of war. But in any case, Wilfred Owen was undoubtedly a major poet, \nand one of the first great truly modern English poets. He died just before the \narmistice that ended World War I. There\'s no telling what he might have \naccomplished if he had lived, but he left behind a good number of immortal \npoems: all of them penned within the short period of time between his enlistment \nand death.\n\n\n\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl)\nby T. S. Eliot\n\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \nLean on a garden urn \nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \nFling them to the ground and turn\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\n\nSo I would have had him leave,\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\nSo he would have left\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\nI should find\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\nSome way we both should understand,\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\n\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\nCompelled my imagination many days,\nMany days and many hours:\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\n\nWhen T. S. Eliot began to write, modern poetry began to change. Harold Bloom has \nsuggested that Shakespeare invented the modern human being. I would venture to say that T. S. Eliot \ninvented the modern poet (pale, introverted, fastidious, self-absorbed and \ntherefore endlessly dismayed) when he portrayed himself as Prufrock in "The Love \nSong of J. Alfred Prufrock." Why poets want to be, or feel obliged to be, like \nPrufrock, I have no idea. But that many of them are Prufrocks seems beyond question. \nPerhaps they misread the poem and believed Prufrock ended up with the girls, or \nthe mermaids . . .\n\n\n\nEvery saint has a past\nand every sinner has a future.\nOscar Wilde\n\n\n\nSong For The Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherds crook.\nBeyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for musics cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence. In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beats too swift. The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\nLouise Bogan is a major poet, in my opinion. Hopefully the rest of the reading \nworld will soon catch on. Please be sure to read her other poems on this page, \nespecially "After the Persian."\n\n\n\nBrevity is the soul of lingerie.\nDorothy Parker\n\n\n\nThe Snow Man\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\nWallace Stevens called the poet the "priest of the invisible." In this poem and \nin certain other poems of his, he seems to be the "priest of the nonexistent" \nwho takes "negative capability" to new heights (or would it be depths?). But his \nbest poems are wonders, whether or not one agrees with their conclusions, or understands \nthem.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to live your life:\none is as though nothing is a miracle,\nthe other is as though everything is a miracle.\nAlbert Einstein\n\n\n\n\nTo Earthward\nby Robert Frost\n\nLove at the lips was touch\nAs sweet as I could bear;\nAnd once that seemed too much;\nI lived on air\n\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\nThe flow of  was it musk\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\nDownhill at dusk?\n\nI had the swirl and ache\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\nThat when theyre gathered shake\nDew on the knuckle.\n\nI craved strong sweets, but those\nSeemed strong when I was young:\nThe petal of the rose\nIt was that stung.\n\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\nThat is not dashed with pain\nAnd weariness and fault;\nI crave the stain\n\nOf tears, the aftermark\nOf almost too much love,\nThe sweet of bitter bark\nAnd burning clove.\n\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\nI take away my hand\nFrom leaning on it hard\nIn grass or sand,\n\nThe hurt is not enough:\nI long for weight and strength\nTo feel the earth as rough\nTo all my length.\n\nRobert Frost was far more than just a pragmatic New England farmer-turned-poet. "To \nEarthward" is one of the best bittersweet love poems in the English language.\n\n\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nIn this stunning poem Dylan Thomas disproves nearly all the conventional \n"wisdom" of the workshops: always avoid adjectives or only use esoteric ones, avoid \n"predictable rhyme," don\'t repeat words in close proximity, etc. Thomas was yet \nanother great Romantic poet who died young; he may have been the best of them.\n\n\n\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\nby Ernest Dowson\n\n"The brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long duration" Horace\n\nThey are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\nLove and desire and hate:\nI think they have no portion in us after\nWe pass the gate.\n\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\nOut of a misty dream\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\nWithin a dream.\n\nDowson died at age 32 and is only known for a few poems today, but his best \npoems are highly memorable. He\'s one of my favorite lesser-known poets.\n\n\n\nA Last Word\nby Ernest Dowson\n\nLet us go hence: the night is now at hand;\nThe day is overworn, the birds all flown;\nAnd we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\nDespair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\nBroods like an owl; we cannot understand\nLaughter or tears, for we have only known\nSurpassing vanity: vain things alone\nHave driven our perverse and aimless band.\nLet us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\nTo Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\nFind end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\nFreedom to all from love and fear and lust.\nTwine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\nOur life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\n\nDowson\'s influence on the language and other writers can be seen in phrases like \n"gone with the wind" and "the days of wine and roses." His work certainly influenced T. S. \nEliot, who once said that certain lines of Dowson "have always run in my head."\n\n\n\nThey Flee from Me\nby\nThomas Wyatt\n\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\nThat now are wild and do not remember\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\n\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\n\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\n\nWyatt\'s poem seems remarkably fresh and stunningly original today, although it \nwas one of the earliest-written sonnets in the English language. Wyatt was a \nladies\' man who may have had an affair with Anne Boleyn. His other\nbest-known poem, "Whoso \nList to Hunt," may have been written with her in mind.\n\n\n\nFull Fathom Five\nby William Shakespeare\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n Of his bones are coral made;\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n Nothing of him that doth fade\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\n Ding-dong.\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\n\nI have always loved the songs of Shakespeare better than his sonnets. Other great poets \nalso wrote wonderful songs, including Robert Burns ("Auld Lang Syne") \nand Ben Jonson ("Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes"); even the famously difficult \nT. S. Eliot wrote the lyrics that later inspired the musical "Cats."\n\n\n\nIs there any reward?\nby Hillaire Belloc\n\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\nI am broken and bored,\nIs there any reward\nReassure me, Good Lord,\nAnd inform me about it.\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\n\nIt seems the only possible compassionate reactions to the "good news" of \nChristianity are despair and "foxhole humor." Belloc resorts to wry good humor.\n\n\n\nVIIIfrom Sunday Morning\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nShe hears, upon that water without sound,\nA voice that cries, The tomb in Palestine\nIs not the porch of spirits lingering.\nIt is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\nWe live in an old chaos of the sun,\nOr old despondency of day and night,\nOr island solitude, unsponsored, free,\nOf that wide water, inescapable.\nDeer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\nWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;\nSweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\nAnd, in the isolation of the sky,\nAt evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\nAmbiguous undulations as they sink,\nDownward to darkness, on extended wings.\n\nSunday Morning is one of the greatest poems in the English canon. The final \nstanza of Sunday Morning contrasts human faith and its revelations to nature \nand its ambiguities. As the pigeons sink downward to darkness, what can we make \nof the ambiguous undulations of their wings?\n\n\n\nThe Eagle and the Mole\nby Elinor Wylie\n\nAvoid the reeking herd,\nShun the polluted flock,\nLive like that stoic bird,\nThe eagle of the rock.\n\nThe huddled warmth of crowds\nBegets and fosters hate;\nHe keeps above the clouds\nHis cliff inviolate.\n\nWhen flocks are folded warm,\nAnd herds to shelter run,\nHe sails above the storm,\nHe stares into the sun.\n\nIf in the eagle\'s track\nYour sinews cannot leap,\nAvoid the lathered pack,\nTurn from the steaming sheep.\n\nIf you would keep your soul\nFrom spotted sight or sound,\nLive like the velvet mole:\nGo burrow underground.\n\nAnd there hold intercourse\nWith roots of trees and stones,\nWith rivers at their source,\nAnd disembodied bones.\n\nThis is wonderfully scary poem by a poet who is under-known and \nunder-appreciated today. One can seldom trust the "advice" of poets. If I \napprehend the wily Wylie correctly, it seems she offers us three options: (1) the dubious \nwarmth of the reeking herd, (2) the alien loneliness of the aloof eagle, or (3) \nthe blind burrowing of the velvet mole.\n\n\n\nNothing Gold Can Stayby Robert Frost\n\nNature\'s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.\n\nThis is a wonderfully simple poem, but hardly simplistic. Most poets raptly \npraise God and Nature, but Robert Frost seems too honest and wise for such \nshenanigans.\n\n\n\nThose Winter Sundaysby Robert Hayden\n\nSundays too my father got up early\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\nthen with cracked hands that ached\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\nwho had driven out the cold\nand polished my good shoes as well.\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\nI believe Robert Hayden became an immortal poet with this poem. I wonder how \nmany children will read it and suddenly realize how much of their lives \ntheir parents sacrificed to their upbringing.\n\n\n\nTea at the Palaz of Hoon\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nNot less because in purple I descended\nThe western day through what you called\nThe loneliest air, not less was I myself.\n\nWhat was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?\nWhat were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?\nWhat was the sea whose tide swept through me there?\n\nOut of my mind the golden ointment rained,\nAnd my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.\nI was myself the compass of that sea:\n\nI was the world in which I walked, and what I saw\nOr heard or felt came not but from myself;\nAnd there I found myself more truly and more strange.\n\nThis is an interesting poem because Wallace Stevens seems to have been an \natheist, and yet he wrote one of the most mystical poems in the English \nlanguage.\n\n\n\nAcquainted With The Night \nby Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\n\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\n\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\n\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\n\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\nThis is a deliciously scary poem about human alienation. It seems we can be not \nonly alienated from each other, but even from ourselves. Madness ran in Frost\'s \nfamily, along with a dark Calvinism. Ah, the sweet joys of fundamentalism!\n\n\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\nby Walt Whitman\n\n\nA noiseless patient spider,\nI mark\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\nMark\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch\'d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,\nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,\nTill the bridge you will need be form\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\nWalt Whitman is the most mystical of American poets: the American Blake and \nRumi. This is one of my favorite poems of all time. I never get tired of reading \nit.\n\n\n\nDover Beachby Matthew Arnold\n\nThe sea is calm to-night,\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\nOnly, from the long line of spray\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\nListen! you hear the grating roar\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\nAt their return, up the high strand,\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\n\nSophocles long ago\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\nOf human misery; we\nFind also in the sound a thought,\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\n\nThe sea of faith\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\nBut now I only hear\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\nRetreating, to the breath\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\n\nAh, love, let us be true\nTo one another! for the world which seems\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\n\nThis may be the first truly great modern poem, along with "The Love Song of J. \nAlfred Prufrock" by T. S. Eliot. Matthew Arnold stopped writing poetry when he \ncould no longer "create joy," but this magnificent poem will \nundoubtedly remain a joy forever.\n\n\n\n\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art\nby Dylan Thomas\n\nIn my craft or sullen art\nExercised in the still night\nWhen only the moon rages\nAnd the lovers lie abed\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\nI labour by singing light\nNot for ambition or bread\nOr the strut and trade of charms\nOn the ivory stages\nBut for the common wages\nOf their most secret heart.\nNot for the proud man apart\nFrom the raging moon I write\nOn these spindrift pages\nNor for the towering dead\nWith their nightingales and psalms\nBut for the lovers, their arms\nRound the griefs of the ages,\nWho pay no praise or wages\nNor heed my craft or art.\n\nI believe this poem is a wonderful validation of the art and craft of the \nRomantic Poet, who writes for the sake of love, even if lovers misapprehend or \nignore him.\n\n\n\n\nThe Garden\nby Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\n\nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth.\n\nIn her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\nThis poem is a wonderful bit of commentary on the utter strangeness of human \nsocieties and their castes. How many of us long for companionship, but are \nreluctant to seek it below our station? Is it worse to be alone, or to associate \nwith our "inferiors"?\n\n\n\nLuke Havergal\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\n\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nIn eastern skies.\n\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\nTo tell you this.\n\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\n"Luke Havergal" is like a ghost story in which the reader becomes one with the \nghost. When we recognize our affinity with the poem\'s protagonist, the poem \nbecomes all the more terrifying.\n\n\n\nI  Easter Hymn\nby A. E. Housman\n\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\n\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\n\nHousman is among the most direct and plainspoken of poets, and therefore among the \nvery strongest. He is also one of our best critics of human societies and \nreligion, along with Blake, Wilde, Whitman and a few others. Housman didn\'t \ncreate art for art\'s sake, but art for humanity\'s sake.\n\n\n\nThe Darkling Thrush\nby Thomas Hardy\n\nI leant upon a coppice gate\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\n The weakening eye of day.\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\n Like strings of broken lyres,\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\n Had sought their household fires.\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\n The wind his death-lament.\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\nAnd every spirit upon earth\n Seemed fervourless as I.\nAt once a voice arose among\n The bleak twigs overhead\nIn a full-hearted evensong\n Of joy illimited;\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\n In blast-beruffled plume,\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\n Upon the growing gloom.\nSo little cause for carolings\n Of such ecstatic sound\nWas written on terrestrial things\n Afar or nigh around,\nThat I could think there trembled through\n His happy good-night air\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\n And I was unaware.\n\nIf I remember things correctly, this poem was written at the close of the \nnineteenth century, perhaps to usher in the twentieth. If so, at least \nit closes on a somewhat hopeful note. Perhaps there is a Hope of which humanity \nis unaware, and which Religion (hopefully) misapprehends.\n\n\n\n\nOzymandias\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nI met a traveller from an antique land\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\n"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\nMany of the best poems are stories. This poem tells a compelling story in a \nmeter that seems both natural and effortless. Later poets like Wallace Stevens \nand Hart Crane would also manage to write poems that remained metrical without \ndescending into "sing-songy-ness."\n\n\n\n\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\nThis is a near-perfect loose translation of a poem by the French poet Ronsard. \nYeats no doubt wrote it with the love of his life, Maude Gonne, in mind.\n\n\n\nThe Convergence Of The Twain\nby Thomas Hardy\n\nLines on the loss of the "Titanic"\n\nIn a solitude of the sea\nDeep from human vanity,\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\nOf her salamandrine fires,\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\nOver the mirrors meant\nTo glass the opulent\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\nJewels in joy designed\n To ravish the sensuous mind\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\n Gaze at the gilded gear\nAnd query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?"...\nWell: while was fashioning\n This creature of cleaving wing,\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\n Prepared a sinister mate\n For herso gaily great\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\n And as the smart ship grew\n In stature, grace, and hue,\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\n Alien they seemed to be;\n No mortal eye could see\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\n Or sign that they were bent\n By paths coincident\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\n Till the Spinner of the Years\n Said "Now!" And each one hears,\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.\n\nThis is a near-perfect poem by one of the first modern masters. Hardy didn\'t \nseem to believe in a benevolent God, but in some sort of inexorable process of Fate.\n\n\n\nThe Turtle\nby Ogden Nash\n\nThe turtle lives \'twixt plated decks\nWhich practically conceal its sex.\nI think it clever of the turtle\nIn such a fix to be so fertile.\n\nOgden Nash was a wonderfully clever poet; this is my favorite poem of his, but \nhe wrote any number of poems that are comparable in quality.\n\n\n\nThe Hippopotamus\nby Hillaire Belloc\n\nI shoot the Hippopotamus\nWith bullets made of platinum,\nBecause if I use leaden ones\nHis hide is sure to flatten \'em.\n\nI once watched a nature show in which a whole pride of lions was unable to bring \ndown a single hippopotamus, because its hide was so thick their fangs seemed \nunable to penetrate it. (Being a poet, I can appreciate the advantages of \nhaving Thick Skin.)\n\n\n\nSong\nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\nChristina Rossetti, in her strongest poems, is one of the best of the Romantics, \nand a stronger poet than her more famous brother, the poet/painter Dante Gabriel \nRossetti.\n\n\n\nBagpipe Music\nby Louis MacNeice\n\nIt\'s no go the merrygoround, it\'s no go the rickshaw,\nAll we want is a limousine and a ticket for the peepshow.\nTheir knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes are made of python,\nTheir halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls with head of bison.\n\nJohn MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,\nWaited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,\nSold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,\nKept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.\n\nIt\'s no go the Yogi-man, it\'s no go Blavatsky,\nAll we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a taxi.\n\nAnnie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the heather,\nWoke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.\nIt\'s no go your maidenheads, it\'s no go your culture,\nAll we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the puncture.\n\nThe Laird o\' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was sober,\nCounted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one foot over.\nMrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with repulsion,\nSaid to the midwife "Take it away; I\'m through with overproduction."\n\nIt\'s no go the gossip column, it\'s no go the Ceilidh,\nAll we want is a mother\'s help and a sugar-stick for the baby.\n\nWillie Murray cut his thumb, couldn\'t count the damage,\nTook the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a bandage.\nHis brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,\nThrew the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the parish.\n\nIt\'s no go the Herring Board, it\'s no go the Bible,\nAll we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.\n\nIt\'s no go the picture palace, it\'s no go the stadium,\nIt\'s no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,\nIt\'s no go the Government grants, it\'s no go the elections,\nSit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a pension.\n\nIt\'s no go my honey love, it\'s no go my poppet;\nWork your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the profit.\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall forever,\nBut if you break the bloody glass you won\'t hold up the weather.\n\nLouis MacNeice seems like the modern Irish heir of Solomon (wisdom-wise) and \nKipling (meter-wise). In any case, this is a wonderfully entertaining poem with \na devilish sense of humor.\n\n\n\nCold-Blooded Creatures\nby Elinor Morton Wylie\n\nMan, the egregious egoist\n(In mystery the twig is bent)\nImagines, by some mental twist,\nThat he alone is sentient\n\nOf the intolerable load\nThat on all living creatures lies,\nNor stoops to pity in the toad\nThe speechless sorrow of his eyes.\n\nHe asks no questions of the snake,\nNor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom\nWhere lidless fishes, broad awake,\nSwim staring at a nightmare doom.\n\nThis is another scary poem by the wily Wylie. If the bent twig refers to the \ngarden of Eden myth, as I suspect, Wylie may be making the point that since \ncold-blooded creatures understand evil (death), man was taken to the cleaners by \nhis "god" or his religion, or both, since he got nothing of value from the \n"forbidden fruit."\n\n\n\nTo Brooklyn Bridge\nby Hart Crane\n\nHow many dawns, chill from his rippling rest\nThe seagull\'s wings shall dip and pivot him,\nShedding white rings of tumult, building high\nOver the chained bay waters Liberty\n\nThen, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes\nAs apparitional as sails that cross\nSome page of figures to be filed away;\nTill elevators drop us from our day ...\n\nI think of cinemas, panoramic sleights\nWith multitudes bent toward some flashing scene\nNever disclosed, but hastened to again,\nForetold to other eyes on the same screen;\n\nAnd Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced\nAs though the sun took step of thee, yet left\nSome motion ever unspent in thy stride,\nImplicitly thy freedom staying thee!\n\nOut of some subway scuttle, cell or loft\nA bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,\nTilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,\nA jest falls from the speechless caravan.\n\nDown Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,\nA rip-tooth of the sky\'s acetylene;\nAll afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...\nThy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.\n\nAnd obscure as that heaven of the Jews,\nThy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow\nOf anonymity time cannot raise:\nVibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.\n\nO harp and altar, of the fury fused,\n(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)\nTerrific threshold of the prophet\'s pledge,\nPrayer of pariah, and the lover\'s cry,\n\nAgain the traffic lights that skim thy swift\nUnfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,\nBeading thy pathcondense eternity:\nAnd we have seen night lifted in thine arms.\n\nUnder thy shadow by the piers I waited;\nOnly in darkness is thy shadow clear.\nThe City\'s fiery parcels all undone,\nAlready snow submerges an iron year ...\n\nO Sleepless as the river under thee,\nVaulting the sea, the prairies\' dreaming sod,\nUnto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend\nAnd of the curveship lend a myth to God.\n\nHart Crane has long been one of my favorite poets. Few poets can rival his \nstrongest poems. He and Wallace Stevens wrote some of the most fluid rhythms to \nbe found in modern English poetry.\n\n\n\nThe Most of It\nby Robert Frost\n\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\nBut counterlove, original response.\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\nInstead of proving human when it neared\nAnd someone else additional to him,\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\n\nI imagine this poem to be about a poet seeking "original response" rather than \n"copy speech," only to be confronted by a force of nature beyond speech and \nunderstanding. And yet Frost managed to turn the experience into a damn good \npoem!\n\n\n\nResume\nby Dorothy Parker\n\nRazors pain you;\nRivers are damp;\nAcids stain you;\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\nNooses give;\nGas smells awful;\nYou might as well live.\n\nIt seems that for all man\'s inventiveness, particularly in matters of mayhem, he \nstill hasn\'t figured out a really good way to end his own existence.\n\n\n\nAthenian Epitaphs\n\nNow that I am dead sea-enclosed Cyzicus shrouds my bones.\nFaretheewell, O my adoptive land that nurtured me, that held me;\nI take rest at your breast.\nMichael R. Burch, \nafter Erycius\n\nMariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be,\nbut go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.\nMichael R. Burch, \nafter Plato\n\nDoes my soul abide in heaven, or hell?\nOnly the sea gulls in their high, lonely circuits may tell.\nMichael R. Burch, \nafter Glaucus\n\nPasserby,\ntell the Spartans we lie\nhere, dead at their word,\nobedient to their command.\nHave they heard?\nDo they understand?\nMichael R. Burch, \nafter Simonides\n\nThe epitaphs the ancient Greeks left engraved on their tombstones are the \nliterary ancestors of our modern epigrams. The four epitaphs above are from a \ncollection of loose translations of mine called Athenian Epitaphs.\n\n\n\nIncidental Effects of the Revival of Fascism on a Provincial French Island\nby Tom Merrill\n\nAnd now they begin\nto get uppity, par exemple\nas when Alex, a freewheeling\n\nhandsome young local\nschizophrenic and militant\ntippler (I mean, it\'s\n\nhis right. . .it\'s\n. . .his destiny!) on his way\nto my door the other day (de\n\nrigueur  bottle in hand)\nwas accosted by some smart\nsuperior new neighbor and advised\n\nto scram, take a hike\nexit the area, or\nMr. Class would stick forth a grand\n\ndigit, regally\npoke off a trio of beeps, blow\nhis personal horn, order\n\na special unscheduled pickup, and\nin short, summon\nsome troops to sweep\n\nout the trash. Now, Alex, who was born\njust a few houses down,\nhas lived in and around\n\nthe neighborhood all his life,\nwhile the arriviste\nprick, whoever it was\n\nbut likely equipped\nwith a custom-crafted\nbathroom throne in the shape of\n\nan ice cream cone (that thick,\nsquat waffle-wafer model, say)\nto sit on and be moved,\n\nas prompted by his muse,\nsublimely to extrude\nand duly\n\nt\n h\n e\n r\n i\n n\n\n drop\n\nimpeccably, his\nmost richly inspired passages\nin softly\n\nspiraling swirls (each maybe with\na maraschino cherry on top)\nis only an imported gift,\n\none tip of an insidious\nviral transmigration from\na very correct, catechistic world. But,\n\nlike Alexander, Julius and a lot\nof bugs, he has conquered, can afford\nthe rent (perhaps not\n\nalone) in the adjacent\nnewly refurbished Victorian\nflat-front apartment house adorned\n\nwith sooty brick, \nstained and leaded\nwindows, doors,\niron-railed balconies and a few\n\ntransitional art deco\narchitectural frills,\nso of course\n\nsupposes he\'s the boss,\njust like the tall\nbald guy with the little\n\ndog the other evening as I\nwas putting out my\nweekly donation of well-drained\n\nbottles and stale news:\nContravention! he yells\n(me thinking: Mon Dieu!\n\nnot another\nFudge Sundae on the block?) Well,\nbut what should one do?\n\nI\'m asleep when the new\nlaw says to\nput it out, I protest. It\'s true,\n\nhe admits, but it\'s not\nvery pretty, after all, and you\'ll\nbe fined if they find\n\nyour name in it. Recalling\na sticker on The Gazette,\nI took my cue,\n\nhauled it back in,\nconcerned lest Mr. Park Avenue\nshould have a trigger\n\nfinger\ntoo. It even occurred\nto me from his arresting yammer he\n\nmight be an official\nBloomenbroom Party member,\nor maybe\n\na quaintly \ncamouflaged cop. It anyway\nseems my turn had come\nto learn the price \nof Eden, see\n\nhow it feels to be out of grace\nwith the lord of the manor, welcome\nas a turd on the kitchen floor, invasively\n\nchecked, challenged, monitored,\nsaddled with the fate of being\na foreigner\n\nin your own backyard.  It\'s hard\nfacing an alien infiltration,\nenduring the callous axioms\n\nof a purifying regime,\na circumambient animus,\na purging, pestilent atmosphere\n\naggressively seeded with threats\nby slime-leaking snots. For\nthe window boxes this year,\n\nI wanted black flowers,\ndraping down from mon balcon, yes\nto mark a funereal mood, but more\n\nby way of displaying dissent\nfrom the clean, pretty, homogenous,\nuniform, ceaselessly\n\npatrolled and guarded\nstifling prison culture where\nblossoms are rife but somehow merde\n\nis still the only\nscent in the air (though,\nno doubt, they\'d\n\njust be smelling gardenias there)\nbut had to settle instead for the cheery\nstandard party-colored rainbow\n\nof saumons, purples, yellows, reds,\nas if the daily promenade\nstill featured la resistance francaise\n\nand not Bloomenbroomers on parade,\nas if there were cause\nto celebrate,\n\nanything more ahead than that\nwhen someday Alex and I are vagrantly\nsipping a vintage Armagnac\n\nfrom my popular crystal snifters,\nsome sitting local resident bard\nwill plosively half-evacuate\n\nboth nether and nasal\noutlets, sniff his\nheady art, decide to apply\n\nfor a patent on that nifty\npoetic device of mine for royal\nasses (in white or tan\n\nshiny gold-crested porcelain) and\nthereby\nmake such a splashy killing off my\n\ncone-thrones he can scoop up every\npiece of the Skippy\nPeanut Butter pie, take\n\nGray Poupon to the cleaner\'s, become\nThe Emperor of Ice Cream, rake\nin shitloads of cash by\n\nproviding a fitting place,\na due\nrepository for the race\'s\n\nripest, most eloquent,\nmost reliable product:\n... waste.\n\n\nIn the poem above, Tom Merrill has turned potty talk into an art form. His \ndisgust with polite society is apparent, and his disdain is well-deserved.\n\n\n\n\nOther outstanding poems that have been published by The HyperTexts \ninclude:\n\nVoyages by Hart Crane\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song, an \nanonymous ballad, circa 1620\nDirective\nby Robert Frost\nHis Confession by the Archpoet\nWhen I Heard The Learn\'d Astronomer by Walt Whitman\nThe Light of Other Days by Tom Moore\nJerusalem by William Blake\n\nAfter the Persian by Louise Bogan\nThe Armadillo by Elizabeth Bishop\nThe Fish by Elizabeth Bishop\n\nMorning Song of Senlin by Conrad Aiken\nThe Highwayman by Alfred Noyes (a song my mother recited to her \nchildren from memory)\nFirst Fig by Edna St. Vincent Millay\nThe Sick Rose by William Blake\nMethought I Saw\nby John Milton\nSonnet 147 by William Shakespeare\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be by John Keats\nSo We\'ll Go No More A-Roving by George Gordon, Lord Byron\nThe Unreturning by Wilfred Owen\nTo Celia by Ben Jonson\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday by Walter Savage Landor\n\nTo Daffodils by Robert Herrick\nGo, Lovely Rose\nby Edmund Waller\nCirque d\'Hiver by Elizabeth Bishop\nRequiem by Robert L.
