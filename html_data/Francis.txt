b'\n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n  Pope Francis Poems\n  \n  \n\nThe HyperTexts\n\nPope Francis Poems\n\nThese are poems written about Pope Francis, who took his name from Saint Francis \nof Assisi. He was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio. \nI have also included poems written by or about other popes. \n\nSimple Simon\nfor Pope Francis \n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBe fruitful and multiply?\nGreat advice .. for a fruitfly!\nBut for women and men,\nSimple Simon, say When!\n\nIn my poem, Simon is a pun, as the name of the first Pope was Simon Peter. But Simon Peter was married, so this begs the \nquestion: why are Roman Catholic priests required to remain celibate, if the \nfirst and greatest Pope was married? This question seems especially pertinent \ntoday because many children have been molested and raped by \nCatholic priests. Is priestly celibacy the wisdom \nof God or the folly of an error-prone human religion?\n\nAre the Popes wise men, really? They claim to represent an \nall-powerful God, but they ride around in bulletproof Popemobiles, so they don\'t \nreally trust Him. They say God \nis loving, wise and just, but they also say that innocent babies who die \nunbaptized are in danger of places called Hell and Limbo, \neven though such infernal regions were never mentioned by the God of the Bible or \nthe Hebrew prophets. Here is a poem of mine about the strange, dark vision of \nGod created by his alleged representatives, the Popes and Evangelists:\n\nIn His Kingdom of Corpses\nfor Pope Francis\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to speak\nin many enraged discourses,\nhigh from some mountain peak\nwhere Hes lectured man on compassion\nwhile the sparrows around Him fell,\nand babes, for His meager ration\nof rain, died and went to hell,\nunbaptized, for thats His fashion.\n\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to vent\nin many obscure discourses\non the need for man to repent,\nto admit that hes a sinner;\ngive up sex, and riches, and fame;\nbe disciplined at his dinner\nthough always he dies the same,\nwhether fatter or thinner.\n\nIn his kingdom of corpses,\nGod has been heard to speak\nin many absurd discourses\nof mans Ego, precipitous Peak!,\nwhile demanding praise and worship,\nand the bending of every knee.\nAnd though He sounds like the Devil,\nall religious men now agree\nHe loves them indubitably.\n\nPlease keep in mind that my poem is not about God, per se, but the strange, dark \nvision of an unjust God created by Christian theologians. If God is able to save \nhuman beings by grace, as Christian theologians avow, and if no human being is \nable to save himself, as they also avow, why would God save one human being at \nthe expense of another? If God is the only Savior, as the Bible repeatedly \nclaims, why doesn\'t God just save everyone? Human doctors and lifeguards don\'t \ncherry-pick one person to save, then throw away next one away as unworthy. Are \nhuman doctors and lifeguards more gracious than God? Lifeguards and doctors save \neveryone they are able to save ... shouldn\'t the Savior of the World actually \nsave everyone, if that is his mission? \n\nThe problems with Christian theology are legion. For example, the Bible suggests \nthat man is responsible for suffering and death entering the world, due to the \noriginal sin and fall of Adam and Eve. But this makes no sense, because we \nnow know that trillions of animals suffered and died long before man ever walked \nthe planet, and even if the Bible\'s creation account was true, it makes no \nsense, because the animals didn\'t disobey God or obtain the knowledge of good \nand evil, and yet they still suffer and die. Here\'s a poem of mine on the \nsubject:\n\nWilly Nilly\nfor Pope Francis\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the Demiurge, aka Jehovah\n\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days uphilly.\nThey ran till they dropped\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\nThey say I should worship you!\nOh, really!\nThey say I should pray\nso youll not act illy.\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\n\nAnother problem for Popes and Christian theologians is the evil, absurd idea \nthat Jesus Christ will return to earth to become the greatest mass murderer in \nthe history of the planet:\n\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\nfor Pope Francis\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat would Santa Claus say,\nI wonder,\nabout Jesus returning\nto Kill and Plunder?\nFor hell likely return\non Christmas Day\nto blow the bad\nlittle boys away!\nWhen He flashes like lightning\nacross the skies\nand many a homosexual\ndies,\nwhen the harlots and heretics\nare ripped asunder,\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\nI wonder?\n\nOne thing that galls me about Christian theology is the bizarre idea that \nmiserly Popes and Christian theologians can be saved by grace, while \nhomosexuals can\'t. The following poem is from a collection of mine entitled Why \nI Left the Religious Right:\n\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insert\nfor Pope Francis\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insertand Hell is for Queers on the back of my shirt.\n And I uphold the Law,\n for Grace has a Flaw:\nthe Church must have someone to drag through the dirt.\nIve got ten thousand reasons why Hell must exist,\nand youre at the top of my fast-swelling list!\n Youre nothing like me,\n so God must agree\nand slam down the Hammer with His Loving Fist!\nFor what are the chances that God has a plan\nto save everyone: even Boy George and Wham!?\n Eternal fell torture\n in Hells pressure scorcher\nwill separate homo from Man.\nIm glad Im redeemed, ecstatic youre not.\nDid Christ die for sinners? Perish the thought!\n The good news is this:\n soon my Vengeance is His!,\nfor youre not the lost sheep He sought.\n\nAre the Popes wise men, really? To me, the poets seem wiser. Here\'s a wonderfully ironic poem by one of the \nbest American \npoets. Should men beg God for forgiveness, or vice versa?\n\n\nForgive, O Lord\nby Robert Frost\n\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nKarol Jozef Wojtyla was an unknown Polish poet before he became world-famous as Pope John Paul II. Some of his \nearly poems appeared in Polish\njournals under the pseudonym Andrzej Jawien. His poetry was later collected and\npublished in The Place WithinThe Poetry of Pope John Paul II, with\ntranslations and notes by Jerzy Peterkiewicz.\n\nLines from Meditations on the Book of Genesis: at the Threshold of the\nSistine Chapel\nby Karol Jozef Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II)\ntranslation by Jerzy Peterkiewicz\nFrom dust you came, and to dust you shall return;\nWhat had shape is now shapeless.\nWhat was alive is now dead.\nWhat was beautiful is now the ugliness of decay.\nAnd yet I do not altogether\ndie,\nwhat is indestructible in me remains!\nWhat is imperishable in me\nnow stands face to face before Him Who Is!\n\nThese are nice lines, but on the other hand, how can a man who claims to be the \nVicar of Christ be so profoundly lacking in wisdom that he tells human beings \nit\'s a sin to use condoms and other contraceptives? To command teenagers not \nto use condoms is to condemn many of them to harrowing deaths. Who are the \nPopes, to consign children to dust, before their time? And the ones who don\'t \ndie prematurely may unwisely contribute to the overpopulation of the planet, \nwith all the suffering that entails. \n\nPope Benedict XVI\n\nHere\'s my translation of a poem written in German by Joseph Ratzinger, better \nknown to the world as Pope Benedict XVI:\n\nGott Allein Gen\xfcgt\nby Joseph Alois Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI)\n\nGott allein gen\xfcgt:\nWas das Herz auch sonst noch liebt,\nWas es sehnend will umfangen,\nWas es dr\xe4nget zu erlangen,\nIst von ihm ein Schimmer nur,\nDer uns weist auf seine Spur\nEr ist\xb4s, der Dies alles gibt:\nGott allein gen\xfcgt.\n\n\nGod Alone Is Sufficient\ntranslation by Michael R. Burch\n\nGod alone is sufficient:\nWhat else the heart would also love,\nWhat it yearns to embrace,\nWhat it is driven to achieve,\nThese are merely intimations of Him,\nAre merely the spoor that point us toward Him \nHe is the One who gives everything:\nGod alone is sufficient.\n\nBut what sort of loving God refuses to speak to human beings personally, then \ndamns them to an eternal hell for not believing in Him? How is it possible \nfor human beings to love a God who is so petty, cruel and unjust? I find it \nimpossible to reconcile a God of love, wisdom, justice and compassion with a \npetty being who has eternal hissy fits if people don\'t believe in him, when he \nis either unable or unwilling to communicate with them personally. If God loves \nhuman beings and wants them to believe in him, why doesn\'t he just say Hello? \nIf he doesn\'t speak to people, how can he fault them for not believing in \nhim? Is God irrational, or is it the religion that\'s nuttier than a fruitcake? \nAnd while the Popes claim there are rewards for pursuing God, poets like \nHillaire Belloc are not so sure:\n\nIs there any reward?\nby Hillaire Belloc\n\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\nI am broken and bored,\nIs there any reward\nReassure me, Good Lord,\nAnd inform me about it.\nIs there any reward?\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\n\nPerhaps the only possible reasonable, compassionate reactions to the good news of \nChristianity are despair and foxhole humor. In the poem above, Belloc resorts to wry good humor.\n\n\nMy main complaint against Ratzinger/Benedict (very interesting names, for a man \nwho claims to be the Vicar of Christ) is that he has yet to excommunicate a \nsingle pedophile from the ranks of Catholic priests, and yet he continues to \nexcommunicate Catholics who are trying to do good things in the world, such as \nwomen who offer the sacraments. Which is worse, a woman who offers the \nsacraments, or a man who rapes innocent children? How can anyone believe that \nRatzinger/Benedict is capable of speaking infallibly, when he doesn\'t know the \nfirst thing about compassion or justice?\n\nAlexander Pope\n\nThe most famous Pope to write poetry was not a Roman Pontiff, but an English \nlayman: Alexander Pope. Alexander Pope was a major poet and \na wonderful epigrammatist:\n\nI am his Highness\' dog at Kew;\nPray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\n Alexander Pope\n\nKings and Popes strive to make other human beings their obedient lapdogs. But are \nChristian parents wise to allow their children to be trained to jump through \nthe hoops of an unjust religion, like poodles? Alexander Pope\'s ironic lines question the \ndivine right of Kings and the self-appointed tyrants of organized religion: \nPopes, Cardinals, Bishops and evangelists like Billy Graham. What right do these \ntyrants \nhave to tell children that if they don\'t believe as they\'re commanded, they\'ll \ngo to Hell and suffer for all eternity? Could a loving, wise, just God have \nconcocted such a hateful, irrational, unjust religion?\n\nAn honest man\'s the noblest work of God.\n Alexander Pope\n\nAlexander Pope\'s epigram begs the question: are the Popes honest men, or do they \nplay loose, dangerous \ngames with the truth? The dogma of Hell is the perfect (or, more \ncorrectly, perfectly evil) example. According to the \nOld Testament a place called Hell and the possibility of suffering after death \nwere never even mentioned by God or his prophets. \nAnyone who has studied the Old Testament knows that hell was never mentioned to \nAdam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, \nJoshua, King David, Solomon, et al. Therefore Hell clearly did not pre-exist. \nBut there is no verse in the entire Bible in which the creation and \npurpose of hell were ever announced. (Hell just pops up in \nsome of the later-written \nbooks of the Bible like the weasel in the silly song.) But if the Bible is the \nrevelation of a loving, wise, just God, then surely he would have \nannounced the creation and purpose of Hell if he created it, along \nwith detailed instructions about how to avoid it. But he didn\'t. Obviously \nHell was invented by Christian theologians because it was very,\nvery good for \nchurch business. Later, long after the New Testament books had been canonized, the \nCatholic Church and its theologians would also invent Limbo out of thin air, \nsaying innocent babies unlucky enough to die without being splashed with magical \nwater by even-more-magical priests would be denied the grace of God, and thus \nentrance to heaven. But of course Jesus, Peter, Paul and the other apostles \nnever once mentioned the urgent need for newborn babies to be splashed \nwith water, in order to avoid eternal suffering. If Jesus was the Son of God, \nwhy didn\'t he know anything about Limbo, the need for infant baptism, or the \nmysterious age of accountability, which Protestants invented when they decided \nthey didnt\' need magical priests to keep babies from going to hell? And how can anyone believe in the \ninfallibility of Popes who invent places like Hell, Limbo \nand Purgatory, then use \nthem to cause Christian mothers two millennia of terrible emotional anguish, \nby making them believe such evil nonsense? What sort of \nGod punishes babies for dying before they\'re old enough to believe \nsuch sickening crap? (By the way, Pope Benedict now seems to be saying that Limbo doesn\'t \nreally exist, but then how can he explain 1,500 years of Catholic waffling on the \nissue, if hundreds of other Catholic Popes were able to speak infallibly and \nspare Christian parents so much anguish? Oh, what a tangled web we weave / when \nfirst we practice to deceive!)\n\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread.\n Alexander Pope\n\nPopes claim that God causes or allows unbaptized babies to suffer for all \neternity, in Hell or Limbo. Would any angel dare make such a terrible claim?\n\nThe Archpoet\n\nMy favorite poet on religious matters is the Archpoet, a medieval Latin poet. He wrote on the cusp of \nthe first Inquisition and was no fan of highly dubious Christian theology. His \nwonderfully heretical Confession should cause the Popes to reconsider their \nblasphemies, which turn God into the Devil:\n\nHis Confession\nby the Archpoet\n\n\ncirca 1165; translated from\nthe original Medieval Latin\nby Helen Waddell\n\n\nSeething over inwardly\nWith fierce indignation,\nIn my bitterness of soul,\nHear my declaration.\nI am of one element,\nLevity my matter,\nLike enough a withered leaf\nFor the winds to scatter.\n\nSince it is the property\nOf the sapient\nTo sit firm upon a rock,\nit is evident\nThat I am a fool, since I\nAm a flowing river,\nNever under the same sky,\nTransient for ever.\n\nHither, thither, masterless\nShip upon the sea,\nWandering through the ways of air,\nGo the birds like me.\nBound am I by ne\'er a bond,\nPrisoner to no key,\nQuesting go I for my kind,\nFind depravity.\n\nNever yet could I endure\nSoberness and sadness,\nJests I love and sweeter than\nHoney find I gladness.\nWhatsoever Venus bids\nIs a joy excelling,\nNever in an evil heart\nDid she make her dwelling.\n\nDown the broad way do I go,\nYoung and unregretting,\nWrap me in my vices up,\nVirtue all forgetting,\nGreedier for all delight\nThan heaven to enter in:\nSince the soul is in me dead,\nBetter save the skin.\n\nPardon, pray you, good my lord,\nMaster of discretion,\nBut this death I die is sweet,\nMost delicious poison.\nWounded to the quick am I\nBy a young girl\'s beauty:\nShe\'s beyond my touching? Well,\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\n\nHard beyond all hardness, this\nMastering of Nature:\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\nNear so fair a creature?\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\nHow should we obey it?\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\nShall they have no say int?\n\nSit you down amid the fire,\nWill the fire not burn you?\nTo Pavia come, will you\nJust as chaste return you?\nPavia, where Beauty draws\nYouth with finger-tips,\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\nRavished with her lips.\n\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\nIn Pavia dine him,\nNever more Hippolytus\nWill the morning find him.\nIn Pavia not a road\nBut leads to venery\nNor among its crowding towers\nOne to chastity.\n\nYet a second charge they bring:\nI\'m forever gaming.\nYea, the dice hath many a time\nStripped me to my shaming\nWhen an if the body\'s cold,\nIf the mind is burning,\nOn the anvil hammering,\nRhymes and verses turning?\n\nLook again upon your list.\nIs the tavern on it?\nYea, and never have I scorned,\nNever shall I scorn it,\nTill the holy angels come,\nAnd my eyes discern them,\nSinging for the dying soul,\nRequiem aeternam.\n\nFor on this my heart is set:\nWhen the hour is nigh me,\nLet me in the tavern die,\nWith a tankard by me,\nWhile the angels looking down\nJoyously sing o\'er me,\nDeus sit propitius\nHuic potatori.\n\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\nIn a tavern tankard\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\nBishop has decanted.\n\nLet them fast and water drink,\nAll the poets\' chorus,\nFly the market and the crowd\nRacketing uproarious.\nSit in quiet spots and think,\nShun the tavern\'s portal\nWrite, and never having lived,\nDie to be immortal.\n\nNever hath the spirit of\nPoetry descended,\nTill with food and drink my lean\nBelly was distended,\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\nMy cerebral story,\nComes Apollo with a rush,\nFills me with his glory.\n\nUnto every man his gift.\nMine was not for fasting.\nNever could I find a rhyme\nWith my stomach wasting.\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\n\'Tis a better chorus\nWhen the landlord hath a good\nVintage set before us.\n\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\nI myself betray me,\nAnd affirm myself to be\nAll my fellows say me.\nSee, they in thy presence are:\nLet whoeer hath known\nHis own heart and found it clean,\nCast at me the stone.\n\nRelated Pages: \nMarilyn Monroe Poems,\nMuhammad Ali Poems,\nAlbert Einstein Poems\nAbraham Lincoln Poems,\nMark Twain Poems,\nNelson Mandela Poems, \nPope Francis Poems,\nRonald Reagan Poems\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
