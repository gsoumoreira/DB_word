Burch\n\n\nHiroshima shadows ... mother and child ...\nOh, when will our hearts ever be beguiled\nto end mindless war ... to seek peace,\n reconciled\nto our common mortality?\n\n\n\n\nThe following is one of the best poems about Hiroshima that I have found to \ndate. It takes an unflinching look at the horror, but also recognizes the \ncourage, humanity and compassion of the victims.\n\nLet Us Be Midwives!\nby Hiroshima survivor Sadako Kurihara\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\n\n\n\n\nHere\'s a poem of mine that asks us to consider the terrible costs of war for ourselves, as well as for innocent children. I have dedicated this\npoem to the children of Hiroshima, and to all children who face suffering and death because of the madness of adults:\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\nMichael R. Burch, "Epitaph for a Child of Hiroshima"\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Christian, or have an interest in such things, you may want to read\nDid a \nMisinterpretation of the Bible lead to the Trail of Tears, American Slavery, \nHiroshima and the Holocaust? \n\nIf you would like to live in a safer, happier world, please consider reading\n\nHow Can We Prevent another Hiroshima, another Holocaust, another Trail of Tears, \nanother Civil War?\n\nThis rest of this page contains poetry, prose and art by Hiroshima survivors and other poets, writers and artists. Now, for a moment, let us turn to the words \nof the man perhaps most responsible for the creation of the atomic bomb:\n\nI am become Death [Shiva],\nthe Destroyer of Worlds.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer, the Supervising Scientist of the Manhattan Project who has been called "the father of the atomic bomb," quoted these words \nfrom the poetry of the Bhagavad-Gita, after watching the first detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\nIf the radiance of a thousand suns\nWere to burst at once into the sky\nThat would be like the splendor of the Mighty One ...\nI am become Death,\nThe Destroyer of Worlds.\nBhagavad-Gita\n\nSeeing your great form\nwith many faces, many eyes, many arms, many thighs and feet,\nand many terrible tusks and stomachs,\nO Mighty Armed,\nthe worlds are terrified and so am I.\nBhagavad-Gita\n\n\n\n\nThe haiku below by a Japanese master reminds us of the transience of life:\n\nGrasses wilt:\nthe braking locomotive\ngrinds to a halt\n\nYamaguchi Seishi, \nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\n\n\n\nThe best poets are truth-tellers. While the witchdoctors and priests of religion call for divine intervention by the gods, the \npoets know the gods have never halted wars that men chose to wage. (This is not just a "Japanese thing" or an "Orienteal thing."\nWhy didn\'t Jesus Christ tell his followers not to make Native Americans walk the Trail of Tears, not to take Africans as slaves, and not to\nburn "witches" and "heretics" at the stake?) The Japanese master Matsuo Basho, perhaps the greatest Oriental poet and certainly one of the \nbest poets to write in any language, illustrates the folly of looking to the gods rather than to ourselves for answers:\n\nGraven images of long-departed gods,\ndry spiritless leaves:\ncompanions of the temple porch\n Matsuo Basho, \nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNow the remaining Hiroshima survivors are aging, and they must wonder if the world has learned anything from their harrowing ordeal. Basho \nagain draws us a compelling picture:\n\nSee: whose surviving sons\nvisit the ancestral graves\nwhite-bearded, with trembling canes?\n Matsuo Basho, \nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIn addition to this page, we have also published two related pages: The Best Haiku of All Time and Japan \nEarthquake/Tsunami Poetry, a collection of poems dedicated to the people of Japan after they were hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and \ntsunami.

It has led me to finding peace in my heart, and becoming a man of \n  peace.\n\n  Long ago I was lifted from the ashes of Hiroshima to find my way in the \n  world. Before then my Father, a descendent of a proud Samurai family, dressed \n  in a kimono emblazoned with the family crest, "Maru ni Tachi Aoi," of the \n  "hollyhock" [Tokugawa Shogunate lineage], taught me patiently to livethe \n  ancient code of Samurai. How important it was to him to make sure that he \n  had correctly passed on to me the "Seven Codes of the Samurai", as he insisted \n  that we must repay our debts to our ancestorspassing on to our children \n  what we have received. On September 3, 1945 I bade farewell to my Father.\n\n  I became a "hibakusha" (a survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing) leaving \n  the charred cradle of childhood with a heart twistedhatred, for a harsh \n  journey toward manhood.  As a teenager, I immigrated to America, my youthful \n  mind thinking it my duty to seek revenge for the destruction of my family.\n \n  Now a naturalized American citizen, my Father\'s teaching has become the \n  touchstone of my life, enabling me to survive and setting me on the "Path of \n  Peace" to the wisdom of manhood with an open heart of love and forgiveness.  I \n  am now a product of two culturestraditional Japan, the nation of my \n  birthand America, my adopted nation.\n \n  Looking back on the last 60 years of my life, my life-journey has not been \n  what I expected; my final destination not exactly as I had charted it. But I \n  am neither dismayed nor disappointed. The conflicts of my past shaped and \n  redirected me. I now honor both the past and the present while expressing my \n  love for two countries that both wounded and nurtured me. My life is like \n  embroidery, many different lengths of threads, crisscrossing in many colors, \n  adding to an iridescent tapestry of human dignity.\n\n  Although I was young and filled with anger, after many turbulent years both \n  in postwar Japan and America, I had to search into the deepest chamber \n  of my soul in my deepest anguishing hour. I realized that I had not only  \n  survived the bombing of Hiroshima, but that my Fathers teaching of the Seven Codes \n  of the Samurai had kept my heart and soul intact, preserved the essence of who I \n  am, and saved me from self-destruction!\n \n  On August 5, 1985 I had a personal epiphany that changed my lifes direction. \n  In a moment of anger, I suddenly \n  remembered the dream about a white Crane and Butterfly I had the night before \n  the bombing in Hiroshima. \n \n  I would like to share the story of the crane and the butterfly, and my journey \n  from revenge to forgiveness and peace, symbolizedfolding an origami paper \n  crane and transforming it into a butterfly. This story begins the night before \n  the bombing, as I sat in a community bomb shelter with my family. I had a \n  transcendent vision of the crane and the butterfly. In my vision, I was taken \n  to see the white crane, Senba-zuru, as mighty as a thousand cranes, who talked \n  to me of loss, survival and transformation. I was shown many of the horrors to \n  come and also told that the keys to survival were to remember who I am and to \n  follow the light within. At the end of the vision, I was horrified to see \n  Senba-zuru perish in a giant fireball. But then, as I lay desolate, sobbing on \n  the ground, I saw him return as a white butterfly.\n \n  In the aftermath of the bombing, I forgot this vision for \n  forty years until August 5, 1985, while driving to a remembrance rally in San \n  Franciscoa mushroom-shaped cloud formation in the distance brought \n  the memory flooding back. A white butterfly flew into my car, gracefully \n  landing on the dashboard. It stayed there momentarily, a fluttering pair of \n  iridescent wings, recreating the symphonic melodies that I had heard on that \n  night of the visionthen it flew out, soaring freely into the blue \n  sky. At that moment, the weight of the past was lifted from my heart. Looking \n  back, I realize that the crane and the butterfly had been guiding me like an \n  unseen rudder through stormy seas of hatred and revenge to forgiveness to \n  peace.\n \n  My spiritual journey, reconnecting with and reconciling my past with the \n  events of history and applying this experience to the present, for the benefit \n  of future generations, is my life goal. The message is clear and simple. At \n  last, I come home to my real promise to my Father, a place called "PEACE \n  through forgiveness"letting go of my painful past. I can say at last I \n  am now a man of "PEACE".\n \n  I was finally able to embrace my Fathers teaching, the Seven Codes of \nSamurai, which has allowed me, having gone through the darkest clouds of raging \nstorms, to enter into the eye of the storm, where I am now able to see the \nworld from a different perspective. I set a lifetime goal of helping future \ngenerations live in Heiwa: peace, with harmony and equality. At \n  the Silkworm Peace Institute, a nonprofit organization I founded, we foster \n  the message of hope, healing, cultural understanding, attempting to transform \n  revenge and anger into peace and forgiveness to others.\n\nRelated pages: \nSandy Hook Poems, Aurora Poetry,\nColumbine Poems,\nCourtni Webb\'s Sandy Hook Poem and Possible Expulsion,\nDarfur Poems,\nGaza Poems,\nHaiti Poems, \nHiroshima Poems, Holocaust Poems,\nNakba Poems,\n911 Poems,\nTrail of Tears\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
