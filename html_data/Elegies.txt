In one man\'s opinion, for whatever it\'s worth, the poems on this page are among the best \r\nsad, dark and mournful poems of all time. Some of these poems are justifiably famous; others are probably unknown to most readers. Please look especially for two poems, Tom O\'Bedlam \r\nand Wulf and Eadwacer, both by one of my favorite poets, Anonymous. Other poems of special interest are the lovely and touching Requiescat by Oscar Wilde (immediately below); \r\ntwo translations of epigrams by the ancient Greek poet Sappho of Lesbos; and masterpieces of the genre by William Blake, Louise Bogan, John Clare, Hart Crane, Emily Dickinson, John Donne, \r\nRobert Frost, John Keats, Robert Hayden, Gerard Manley Hopkins, A. E. Housman, Langston Hughes, Robert Lowell, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sylvia Plath, Christina Rossetti, William \r\nShakespeare, Wallace Stevens, Sir Thomas Wyatt and William Butler Yeats.\r\n\r\nMy personal top ten writers of elegies and laments are: (#10) Ben Jonson On My First Son and On My First Daughter (#9) \r\nJohn Crowe Ransom Bells for John Whiteside\'s Daughter (#8) Conrad Aiken Bread and Music (#7) Dylan Thomas Do \r\nNot Go Gently Into That Good Night (#6) John Milton Lycidias, On \r\nShakespeare and Methought I Saw (#5) William Dunbar Lament for the Makaris \r\n(#4) Percy Bysshe Shelley Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats (#3) \r\nAlfred Tennyson In Memoriam A.H.H. (#2) W.H. Auden Funeral Blues and In \r\nMemory of W.B. Yeats (#1) Walt Whitman\'s wonderful elegies for Abraham \r\nLincoln: O Captain! My Captain! and When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\'d\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most mysterious poet on this page is Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. To our knowledge, she had never written a poem before Do not stand at my \r\ngrave and weep came to her in a sudden flash of compassion for the daughter of \r\na Holocaust victim. The poem and its rather miraculous story appear a few poems \r\ndown on this page. \r\n\r\nI think it worth special mention that two of the best elegies in the English \r\nlanguage were written by the poet Thomas Gray for his friend and fellow poet \r\nRichard West. They were born the same year, 1716, went to Eton together, and \r\nobviously cared very much for one another. Gray\'s Elegy Written in a Country \r\nChurch-Yard has been called the most loved poem in the English language. It may \r\nbe, at once, both the most touching and the most perfect longer poem in the \r\nEnglish canon. You can find both poems at the bottom of this page. \r\n\r\ncompiled by\r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe Oscar Wilde\'s wonderful elegy above, written for his beloved sister Isola \r\nwho died at age ten, may have been inspired or influenced by an \r\nancient poet:\r\n\r\nLie lightly on her, turf and dew ...\r\nShe put so little weight on you.\r\nMarcus Valerius Martial\r\n\r\nThe lines above appear in a poem Martial wrote for a slave girl, Erotion, who died six days short of her sixth birthday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 137\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nFacing Death, that inescapable journey,\r\nwho can be wiser than he\r\nwho reflects, while breath yet remains,\r\non whether his life brought others happiness, or pains,\r\nsince his soul may yet win delight\'s  \r\nor night\'s way\r\nafter his death-day.\r\n\r\nBede, also known as the Good Bede and the Venerable Bede, was an ancient scholar \r\nwho has been called the Father of English History. Bede\'s Death Song is one of \r\nthe oldest elegies in the English language. Old English is also known as \r\nAnglo-Saxon English; the Angles and Saxons were Germanic tribes. England takes \r\nits name from the Angles. Here is the original Anglo-Saxon text:\r\n\r\nFore \xf0\xe6m nedfere n\xe6nig wior\xf0e\r\n\xf0onc snottora \xf0on him \xf0earf si\xe6\r\nto ymbhycgenne \xe6r his hinionge\r\nhw\xe6t his gast\xe6 godes o\xf0\xf0e yfles\r\n\xe6fter dea\xf0 d\xe6ge doemed wior\xf0e.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Swift\'s Epitaph\r\nby Jonathan Swift\r\n\r\nSwift has sailed into his rest; \r\nSavage indignation there \r\nCannot lacerate his Breast. \r\nImitate him if you dare, \r\nWorld-Besotted Traveler; he \r\nServed human liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nSwift\'s Epitaph has an interesting genesis and history. Jonathan Swift wrote \r\nhis own epitaph, in Latin. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats translated it, rather freely, into English. \r\nA friend of Swift\'s, the poet and playwright John Gay, also wrote his own \r\nepitaph, which follows ...\r\n\r\nMy Own Epitaph \r\nby John Gay\r\n\r\nLife\'s a jest, and all things show it. \r\nI thought so once, and now I know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Excerpt from The Last Song of Sappho\r\nby Felicia Hemans Browne\r\n\r\nSOUND on, thou dark unslumbering sea!\r\nMy dirge is in thy moan;\r\n My spirit finds response in thee,\r\nTo its own ceaseless cry\'Alone, alone!\'\r\n\r\nFelicia Hemans and Percy Bysshe Shelley were born a year apart, looked enough \r\nalike to be brother and sister, and were both child prodigies: she was published \r\nat age fourteen; he entered Eton College at age twelve and was said to have only \r\nattended one lecture, preferring to read sixteen hours per day and perform \r\nscientific experiments that earned him the nickname Mad Shelley. Another thing \r\nthey had in common was a taste and appreciation for Sappho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\r\nby Randall Jarrell \r\n\r\nFrom my mother\'s sleep I fell into the State, \r\nAnd I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. \r\nSix miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, \r\nI woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. \r\nWhen I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.\r\n\r\nRandall Jarrell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1914, the year World War I \r\nbegan. He earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees from Vanderbilt University, \r\nwhere he studied under Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate. In \r\n1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and worked as a control tower operator \r\nduring World War II, an experience which influenced and provided material for \r\nhis poetry. Jarrells reputation as a poet was established in 1945 with the \r\npublication of his second book,Little Friend, Little Friend, which \r\nbitterly and dramatically documents the intense fears and moral struggles of \r\nyoung soldiers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \r\ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Living Hand\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\r\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\r\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\r\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\r\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\r\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\r\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\r\nI hold it towards you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong \r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Winter Sundays\r\nby Robert Hayden\r\n\r\nSundays too my father got up early\r\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\r\nthen with cracked hands that ached\r\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\r\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\r\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\r\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\r\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\r\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\r\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\r\nwho had driven out the cold\r\nand polished my good shoes as well.\r\nWhat did I know, what did I know\r\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn My First Son\r\nby Ben Jonson\r\n\r\n      Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\r\n    My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\r\n    Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\r\n    Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\r\n    O, could I lose all father now! For why\r\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\r\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\r\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\r\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\r\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\r\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\r\n    As what he loves may never like too much.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirge Without Music\r\nby Edna St. Vincent \r\nMillay\r\n\r\nI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.\r\nSo it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:\r\nInto the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned\r\nWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.\r\nLovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.\r\nBe one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.\r\nA fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,\r\nA formula, a phrase remains,but the best is lost.\r\nThe answers quick  keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\r\nThey are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled\r\nIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.\r\nMore precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.\r\nDown, down, down into the darkness of the grave\r\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;\r\nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.\r\nI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation by \r\nMichael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzymandias \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nI met a traveller from an antique land\r\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\r\nStand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,\r\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\r\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\r\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\r\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\r\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\r\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\r\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\r\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\r\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShiloh\r\n(a RequiemApril, 1862)\r\nby Herman Melville\r\n\r\nSkimming lightly, wheeling still,\r\nThe swallows fly low\r\nOver the field in clouded days,\r\nThe forest-field of Shiloh\r\nOver the field where April rain\r\nSolaced the parched ones stretched in pain\r\nThrough the pause of night\r\nThat followed the Sunday fight\r\nAround the church of Shiloh\r\nThe church so lone, the log-built one,\r\nThat echoed to many a parting groan\r\nAnd natural prayer\r\nOf dying foemen mingled there\r\nFoemen at morn, but friends at eve\r\nFame or country least their care:\r\n(What like a bullet can undeceive!)\r\nBut now they lie low,\r\nWhile over them the swallows skim,\r\nAnd all is hushed at Shiloh.\r\n\r\nHerman Melville is, of course, best known today as the author of novels like \r\nMoby-Dick, Typee, Omoo and Billy Budd. But he was also an \r\naccomplished poet, as this lovely, somber elegy attests. The sounds of the poem, \r\nparticularly the repetition of oh sounds in Shiloh and its rhyme words, \r\nmatch its theme and meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpts from More Poems\r\n by A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nThe world goes none the lamer\r\n  For ought that I can see,\r\nBecause this cursed trouble\r\n  Has struck my days and me.\r\n\r\nThe stars of heaven are steady,\r\n  The founded hills remain,\r\nThough I to earth and darkness\r\n  Return in blood and pain.\r\n\r\nFarewell to all belongings\r\n  I won or bought or stole;\r\nFarewell, my lusty carcase,\r\n  Farewell, my aery soul.\r\n\r\nOh worse remains for others\r\n  And worse to fear had I\r\nThan here at four-and-twenty\r\n  To lay me down and die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nI know that I shall meet my fate\r\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\r\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\r\nThose that I guard I do not love;\r\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\r\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\r\nNo likely end could bring them loss\r\nOr leave them happier than before.\r\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\r\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\r\nA lonely impulse of delight\r\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\r\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\r\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\r\nA waste of breath the years behind\r\nIn balance with this life, this death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLost\r\n\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nLost on a fogbound spit of sand\r\nin shoes that pinch me, close at hand\r\nI hear the splash of Charon\'s oar\r\nthat ferries no one to a happy shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuneral Blues\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\r\nPrevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\r\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum\r\nBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\r\n\r\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\r\nScribbling on the sky the message He is Dead.\r\nPut crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\r\nLet the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\r\n\r\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West,\r\nMy working week and my Sunday rest,\r\nMy noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\r\nI thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\r\nPack up the moon and dismantle the sun,\r\nPour away the ocean and sweep up the woods;\r\nFor nothing now can ever come to any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Memory of W. B. Yeats\r\nby W. H. Auden\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in the dead of winter:\r\nThe brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,\r\nAnd snow disfigured the public statues;\r\nThe mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nFar from his illness\r\nThe wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,\r\nThe peasant river was untempted by the fashionable \r\nquays;\r\nBy mourning tongues\r\nThe death of the poet was kept from his poems.\r\n\r\nBut for him it was his last afternoon as himself,\r\nAn afternoon of nurses and rumours;\r\nThe provinces of his body revolted,\r\nThe squares of his mind were empty,\r\nSilence invaded the suburbs,\r\nThe current of his feeling failed; he became his \r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nNow he is scattered among a hundred cities\r\nAnd wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,\r\nTo find his happiness in another kind of wood\r\nAnd be punished under a foreign code of conscience.\r\nThe words of a dead man\r\nAre modified in the guts of the living.\r\n\r\nBut in the importance and noise of to-morrow\r\nWhen the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of \r\nthe Bourse,\r\nAnd the poor have the sufferings to which they are \r\nfairly accustomed,\r\nAnd each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of \r\nhis freedom,\r\nA few thousand will think of this day\r\nAs one thinks of a day when one did something slightly \r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nWhat instruments we have agree\r\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nYou were silly like us; your gift survived it all:\r\nThe parish of rich women, physical decay,\r\nYourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.\r\nNow Ireland has her madness and her weather still,\r\nFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives\r\nIn the valley of its making where executives\r\nWould never want to tamper, flows on south\r\nFrom ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,\r\nRaw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,\r\nA way of happening, a mouth.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEarth, receive an honoured guest:\r\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest.\r\nLet the Irish vessel lie\r\nEmptied of its poetry.\r\n\r\nIn the nightmare of the dark\r\nAll the dogs of Europe bark,\r\nAnd the living nations wait,\r\nEach sequestered in its hate;\r\n\r\nIntellectual disgrace\r\nStares from every human face,\r\nAnd the seas of pity lie\r\nLocked and frozen in each eye.\r\n\r\nFollow, poet, follow right\r\nTo the bottom of the night,\r\nWith your unconstraining voice\r\nStill persuade us to rejoice;\r\n\r\nWith the farming of a verse\r\nMake a vineyard of the curse,\r\nSing of human unsuccess\r\nIn a rapture of distress;\r\n\r\nIn the deserts of the heart\r\nLet the healing fountain start,\r\nIn the prison of his days\r\nTeach the free man how to praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano\r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong For The Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Snow Man\r\nby Wallace Stevens\r\n\r\nOne must have a mind of winter\r\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\r\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\r\n\r\nAnd have been cold a long time\r\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\r\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\r\n\r\nOf the January sun; and not to think\r\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\r\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\r\n\r\nWhich is the sound of the land\r\nFull of the same wind\r\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\r\n\r\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\r\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\r\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquainted With The Night\r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\r\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\r\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\r\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\r\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\r\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\r\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\r\nCame over houses from another street,\r\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\r\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\r\nOne luminary clock against the sky\r\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\r\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Rose of Summer \r\nby Tom Moore\r\n\r\nTis the last rose of summer \r\nLeft blooming alone; \r\nAll her lovely companions \r\nAre faded and gone; \r\nNo flower of her kindred, \r\nNo rosebud is nigh, \r\nTo reflect back her blushes, \r\nTo give sigh for sigh.\r\n\r\nIll not leave thee, thou lone one! \r\nTo pine on the stem; \r\nSince the lovely are sleeping, \r\nGo, sleep thou with them. \r\nThus kindly I scatter \r\nThy leaves oer the bed, \r\nWhere thy mates of the garden \r\nLie scentless and dead.\r\n\r\nSo soon may I follow, \r\nWhen friendships decay, \r\nAnd from Loves shining circle \r\nThe gems drop away. \r\nWhen true hearts lie withered \r\nAnd fond ones are flown, \r\nOh! who would inhabit \r\nThis bleak world alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nTo what purpose, April, do you return again?\r\nBeauty is not enough.\r\nYou can no longer quiet me with the redness\r\nOf little leaves opening stickily.\r\nI know what I know.\r\nThe sun is hot on my neck as I observe\r\nThe spikes of the crocus.\r\nThe smell of the earth is good.\r\nIt is apparent that there is no death.\r\nBut what does that signify?\r\nNot only under ground are the brains of men \r\n\r\nEaten by maggots.\r\nLife in itself\r\nIs nothing,\r\nAn empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.\r\nIt is not enough that yearly, down this hill,\r\nApril\r\nComes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of a Second April\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nApril this year, not otherwise\r\nThan April of a year ago,\r\nIs full of whispers, full of sighs,\r\nOf dazzling mud and dingy snow;\r\nHepaticas that pleased you so\r\nAre here again, and butterflies.\r\n\r\nThere rings a hammering all day,\r\nAnd shingles lie about the doors;\r\nIn orchards near and far away\r\nThe grey wood-pecker taps and bores;\r\nThe men are merry at their chores\r\nAnd children earnest at their play.\r\n\r\nThe larger streams run still and deep,\r\nNoisy and swift the small brooks run.\r\nAmong the mullein stalks the sheep\r\nGo up the hillside in the sun,\r\nPensively,  only you are gone,\r\nYou that alone I cared to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Is Lost\r\nby Noel Coward\r\n\r\nDeep in our sub-conscious, we are told\r\nLie all our memories, lie all the notes\r\nOf all the music we have ever heard\r\nAnd all the phrases those we loved have spoken,\r\nSorrows and losses time has since consoled,\r\nFamily jokes, out-moded anecdotes\r\nEach sentimental souvenir and token\r\nEverything seen, experienced, each word\r\nAddressed to us in infancy, before\r\nBefore we could even know or understand\r\nThe implications of our wonderland.\r\nThere they all are, the legendary lies\r\nThe birthday treats, the sights, the sounds, the tears\r\nForgotten debris of forgotten years\r\nWaiting to be recalled, waiting to rise\r\nBefore our world dissolves before our eyes\r\nWaiting for some small, intimate reminder,\r\nA word, a tune, a known familiar scent\r\nAn echo from the past when, innocent\r\nWe looked upon the present with delight\r\nAnd doubted not the future would be kinder\r\nAnd never knew the loneliness of night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdge\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nThe woman is perfected.\r\nHer dead\r\nBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\r\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\r\nFlows in the scrolls of her toga,\r\nHer bare\r\nFeet seem to be saying:\r\nWe have come so far, it is over.\r\nEach dead child coiled, a white serpent,\r\nOne at each little\r\nPitcher of milk, now empty.\r\nShe has folded\r\nThem back into her body as petals\r\nOf a rose close when the garden\r\nStiffens and odors bleed\r\nFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.\r\nThe moon has nothing to be sad about,\r\nStaring from her hood of bone.\r\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\r\nHer blacks crackle and drag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarren Woman\r\nby Sylvia Plath\r\n\r\nEmpty, I echo to the least footfall,\r\nMuseum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.\r\nIn my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,\r\nNun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies\r\nExhale their pallor like scent.\r\n\r\nI imagine myself with a great public,\r\nMother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.\r\nInstead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.\r\nThe moon lays a hand on my forehead,\r\nBlank-faced and mum as a nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShine, Perishing Republic\r\nby Robinson Jeffers\r\n\r\nWhile this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening \r\nto empire,\r\nAnd protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the \r\nmass hardens,\r\n\r\nI sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots \r\nto make earth.\r\nOut of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence; \r\nand home to the mother.\r\n\r\nYou making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it \r\nstubbornly long or suddenly\r\nA mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains: shine, \r\nperishing republic.\r\n\r\nBut for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the \r\nthickening center; corruption\r\nNever has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monsters feet there \r\nare left the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant, \r\ninsufferable master.\r\nThere is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caughtthey sayGod, \r\nwhen he walked on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of a Toad\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\n A toad the power mower caught,\r\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\r\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\r\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\r\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\r\n Low, and a final glade.\r\n\r\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\r\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\r\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\r\n As still as if he would return to stone,\r\n And soundlessly attending, dies\r\n Toward some deep monotone,\r\n\r\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\r\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\r\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\r\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\r\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\r\n The haggard daylight steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWulf and Eadwacer (an anonymous Anglo-Saxon or Old \r\nEnglish ballad, circa 960 AD)\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy clan\'s curs pursue him like crippled game. \r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\nWe are so different! \r\n\r\nWulf\'s on one island; I\'m on another.\r\nHis island is safe, secured by fens.\r\nThere are fierce men on this island.\r\nThey\'ll rip him apart if he approaches their pack. \r\nWe are so different! \r\n\r\nMy thoughts pursued Wulf like panting hounds. \r\nWhenever it rained and I sobbed, disconsolate,\r\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\r\nFor me, that was pleasant, but its end was loathsome. \r\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\r\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\r\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat. \r\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A wolf has borne\r\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\r\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\r\nour song together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Light of Other Days\r\nby Tom Moore \r\n\r\nOft, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nFond Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me:\r\nThe smiles, the tears\r\nOf boyhood\'s years,\r\nThe words of love then spoken;\r\nThe eyes that shone,\r\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\r\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember all\r\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\r\nI\'ve seen around me fall\r\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\r\nI feel like one\r\nWho treads alone\r\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\r\nWhose lights are fled,\r\nWhose garlands dead,\r\nAnd all but he departed!\r\nThus, in the stilly night,\r\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\r\nSad Memory brings the light\r\nOf other days around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nNature\'s first green is gold,\r\nHer hardest hue to hold.\r\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\r\nBut only so an hour.\r\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\r\nSo Eden sank to grief,\r\nSo dawn goes down to day.\r\nNothing gold can stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nIn my craft or sullen art\r\nExercised in the still night\r\nWhen only the moon rages\r\nAnd the lovers lie abed\r\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\r\nI labour by singing light\r\nNot for ambition or bread\r\nOr the strut and trade of charms\r\nOn the ivory stages\r\nBut for the common wages\r\nOf their most secret heart.\r\nNot for the proud man apart\r\nFrom the raging moon I write\r\nOn these spindrift pages\r\nNor for the towering dead\r\nWith their nightingales and psalms\r\nBut for the lovers, their arms\r\nRound the griefs of the ages,\r\nWho pay no praise or wages\r\nNor heed my craft or art.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song \r\nanonymous ballad, circa 1620\r\n\r\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\r\nThat into rags would rend ye,\r\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\r\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\r\nThat of your five sound senses\r\nYou never be forsaken,\r\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\r\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nOf thirty bare years have I\r\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\r\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\r\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\r\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\r\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\r\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\r\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\r\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\r\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\r\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\r\nI befell into this dotage.\r\nI slept not since the Conquest,\r\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\r\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\r\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\r\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\r\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\r\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\r\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\r\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\r\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\r\nMe music to my sorrow.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\r\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\r\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\r\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\r\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\r\nI sup, and when benighted,\r\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\r\nYet never am affrighted.\r\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nI know more than Apollo,\r\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\r\nI see the stars at mortal wars\r\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\r\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\r\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\r\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\r\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\r\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\r\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\r\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\r\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\r\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\r\nMe handle not nor spare not;\r\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\r\nDo what the panther dare not.\r\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\nWith an host of furious fancies,\r\nWhereof I am commander,\r\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\r\nTo the wilderness I wander.\r\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\r\nI summoned am to tourney\r\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\r\nMethinks it is no journey.\r\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\r\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\r\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\r\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nForgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive the great big one on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n

but no ghost woke.\r\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\r\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\r\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\r\n\r\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\r\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\r\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\r\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\r\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\r\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\r\nby Walter Savage Landor\r\n\r\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\r\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\r\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Fig\r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\n\r\nMy candle burns at both ends;\r\nIt will not last the night;\r\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\r\nIt gives a lovely light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Rose \r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nO Rose, thou art sick.\r\nThe invisible worm\r\nThat flies in the night\r\nIn the howling storm\r\n\r\n\r\nHas found out thy bed\r\nOf crimson joy,\r\nAnd his dark secret love\r\nDoes thy life destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMethought I Saw\r\nby John Milton\r\n\r\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\r\n Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\r\n\r\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\r\n\r\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\r\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\r\n\r\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\r\n\r\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\r\n\r\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\r\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\r\n Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\r\n\r\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\r\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\r\n\r\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\r\n I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Emily Dickinson\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\nYou who desired so muchin vain to ask\r\nYet fed your hunger like an endless task,\r\nDared dignify the labor, bless the quest\r\nAchieved that stillness ultimately best,\r\n\r\nBeing, of all, least sought for:  Emily, hear!\r\nO sweet, dead Silencer, most suddenly clear\r\nWhen singing that Eternity possessed\r\nAnd plundered momently in every breast;\r\n\r\nTruly no flower yet withers in your hand,\r\nThe harvest you descried and understand\r\nNeeds more than wit to gather, love to bind.\r\nSome reconcilement of remotest mind\r\n\r\nLeaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.\r\nElse tears heap all within one clay-cold hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\r\n Old Time is still a-flying:\r\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\r\n Tomorrow will be dying.\r\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\r\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\r\nThe sooner will his race be run,\r\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\r\nThat age is best which is the first,\r\n When youth and blood are warmer;\r\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\r\n Times still succeed the former.\r\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\r\n And while ye may, go marry:\r\nFor having lost but once your prime,\r\n You may for ever tarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtue\r\nby George Herbert\r\n\r\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\r\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\r\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\nFor thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\nThy root is ever in its grave,\r\nAnd thou must die.\r\n\r\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\r\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\r\nAnd all must die.\r\n\r\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\r\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\r\nThen chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Steal by William Wordsworth\r\n\r\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\r\n I had no human fears:\r\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\r\n The touch of earthly years.\r\n\r\nNo motion has she now, no force;\r\n She neither hears nor sees;\r\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\r\n With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Art \r\nby Elizabeth Bishop\r\n\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\r\nso many things seem filled with the intent\r\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\r\n\r\nLose something every day.  Accept the fluster\r\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\r\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant \r\nto travel.  None of these will bring disaster.\r\n\r\nI lost my mother\'s watch.  And look! my last, or\r\nnext-to-last, of three loved houses went.\r\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master.\r\n\r\nI lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,\r\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\r\nI miss them, but it wasn\'t a disaster.\r\n\r\nEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\r\nI love) I shan\'t have lied.  It\'s evident\r\nthe art of losing\'s not too hard to master\r\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nI leant upon a coppice gate\r\n When Frost was spectre-gray,\r\nAnd Winter\'s dregs made desolate\r\n The weakening eye of day.\r\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\r\n Like strings of broken lyres,\r\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\r\n Had sought their household fires.\r\nThe land\'s sharp features seemed to be\r\n The Century\'s corpse outleant,\r\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\r\n The wind his death-lament.\r\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\r\n Was shrunken hard and dry,\r\nAnd every spirit upon earth\r\n Seemed fervourless as I.\r\nAt once a voice arose among\r\n The bleak twigs overhead\r\nIn a full-hearted evensong\r\n Of joy illimited;\r\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\r\n In blast-beruffled plume,\r\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\r\n Upon the growing gloom.\r\nSo little cause for carolings\r\n Of such ecstatic sound\r\nWas written on terrestrial things\r\n Afar or nigh around,\r\nThat I could think there trembled through\r\n His happy good-night air\r\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\r\n And I was unaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convergence Of The Twain by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nLines on the loss of the Titanic\r\n\r\nIn a solitude of the sea\r\nDeep from human vanity,\r\nAnd the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.\r\n Steel chambers, late the pyres\r\nOf her salamandrine fires,\r\nCold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\r\nOver the mirrors meant\r\nTo glass the opulent\r\nThe sea-worm crawlsgrotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\r\nJewels in joy designed\r\n To ravish the sensuous mind\r\nLie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.\r\nDim moon-eyed fishes near\r\n Gaze at the gilded gear\r\nAnd query: What does this vaingloriousness down here?...\r\nWell: while was fashioning\r\n This creature of cleaving wing,\r\nThe Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything\r\n Prepared a sinister mate\r\n For herso gaily great\r\nA Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.\r\n And as the smart ship grew\r\n In stature, grace, and hue,\r\nIn shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.\r\n Alien they seemed to be;\r\n No mortal eye could see\r\nThe intimate welding of their later history,\r\n Or sign that they were bent\r\n By paths coincident\r\nOn being anon twin halves of one august event,\r\n Till the Spinner of the Years\r\n Said Now! And each one hears,\r\nAnd consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Richard Moore for suggesting the inclusion of this poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover Beach\r\nby Matthew Arnold\r\n\r\nThe sea is calm to-night,\r\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\r\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\r\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\r\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\r\nOnly, from the long line of spray\r\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\r\nListen! you hear the grating roar\r\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\r\nAt their return, up the high strand,\r\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\r\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\r\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\r\n\r\nSophocles long ago\r\nHeard it on the Aegean, and it brought\r\nInto his mind the turbid ebb and flow\r\nOf human misery; we\r\nFind also in the sound a thought,\r\nHearing it by this distant northern sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea of faith\r\nWas once, too, at the full, and round earth\'s shore\r\nLay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\r\nBut now I only hear\r\nIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\r\nRetreating, to the breath\r\nOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\r\nAnd naked shingles of the world.\r\n\r\nAh, love, let us be true\r\nTo one another! for the world which seems\r\nTo lie before us like a land of dreams,\r\nSo various, so beautiful, so new,\r\nHath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\r\nNor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\r\nAnd we are here as on a darkling plain\r\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\r\nWhere ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulce Et Decorum Est\r\nby Wilfred Owen\r\n\r\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks \r\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, \r\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs \r\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge. \r\nMen marched asleep.  Many had lost their boots \r\nBut limped on, blood-shod.  All went lame; all blind; \r\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \r\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. \r\n\r\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!An ecstasy of fumbling, \r\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time; \r\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \r\nAnd flound\'ring like a man in fire or lime... \r\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light, \r\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \r\n\r\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight, \r\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \r\n\r\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace \r\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \r\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \r\nHis hanging face, like a devil\'s sick of sin; \r\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \r\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \r\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \r\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,\r\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \r\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \r\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \r\nPro patria mori.\r\n    \r\n    Editor\'s Note:  Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is\r\n    from Horace\'s Odes and means:  It is sweet and fitting\r\n    to die for one\'s country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchohare longam\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life forbids us to entertain hopes of long\r\n    duration Horace\r\n    \r\n    They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\r\n    Love and desire and hate:\r\n    I think they have no portion in us after\r\n    We pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThey are not long, the days of wine and roses:\r\n    Out of a misty dream\r\n    Our path emerges for a while, then closes\r\n    Within a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\nA Last Word\r\nby Ernest Dowson\r\n\r\n      Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;\r\n    The day is overworn, the birds all flown;\r\n    And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;\r\n    Despair and death; deep darkness o\'er the land,\r\n    Broods like an owl; we cannot understand\r\n    Laughter or tears, for we have only known\r\n    Surpassing vanity: vain things alone\r\n    Have driven our perverse and aimless band.\r\n    Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,\r\n    To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust\r\n    Find end of labour, where\'s rest for the old,\r\n    Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.\r\n    Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold\r\n    Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s wife had waited long,\r\nThe tea was cold, the fire was dead;\r\nAnd there might yet be nothing wrong\r\nIn how he went and what he said:\r\nThere are no millers any more,\r\nWas all that she had heard him say;\r\nAnd he had lingered at the door\r\nSo long it seemed like yesterday.\r\nSick with a fear that had no form\r\nShe knew that she was there at last;\r\nAnd in the mill there was a warm\r\nAnd mealy fragrance of the past.\r\nWhat else there was would only seem\r\nTo say again what he had meant;\r\nAnd what was hanging from a beam\r\nWould not have heeded where she went.\r\nAnd if she thought it followed her,\r\nShe may have reasoned in the dark\r\nThat one way of the few there were\r\nWould hide her and would leave no mark:\r\nBlack water, smooth above the weir\r\nLike starry velvet in the night,\r\nThough ruffled once, would soon appear\r\nThe same as ever to the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bustle In A House \r\nby Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nThe bustle in a house\r\nThe morning after death\r\nIs solemnest of industries\r\nEnacted upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping up the heart\r\nAnd putting love away\r\nWe shall not want to use again\r\nUntil eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgetfulness \r\n\r\nby Hart Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForgetfulness is like a song\r\nThat, freed from beat and measure, wanders.\r\nForgetfulness is like a bird whose wings are reconciled,\r\nOutspread and motionless,\r\nA bird that coasts the wind unwearyingly.\r\n\r\nForgetfulness is rain at night,\r\nOr an old house in a forest,or a child.\r\nForgetfulness is white,white as a blasted tree,\r\nAnd it may stun the sybil into prophecy,\r\nOr bury the Gods.\r\n\r\nI can remember much forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died by Emily Dickinson\r\n\r\nI heard a fly buzz when I died;\r\nThe stillness round my form\r\nWas like the stillness in the air\r\nBetween the heaves of storm.\r\n\r\nThe eyes beside had wrung them dry,\r\nAnd breaths were gathering sure\r\nFor that last onset, when the King\r\nBe witnessed in his power.\r\n\r\nI willed my keepsakes, signed away\r\nWhat portion of me I\r\nCould make assignable  and then\r\nThere interposed a fly,\r\n\r\nWith blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz\r\nBetween the light and me;\r\nAnd then the windows failed  and then\r\nI could not see to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Earthward by Robert Frost\r\n\r\nLove at the lips was touch\r\nAs sweet as I could bear;\r\nAnd once that seemed too much;\r\nI lived on air\r\n\r\nThat crossed me from sweet things,\r\nThe flow of  was it musk\r\nFrom hidden grapevine springs\r\nDownhill at dusk?\r\n\r\nI had the swirl and ache\r\nFrom sprays of honeysuckle\r\nThat when theyre gathered shake\r\nDew on the knuckle.\r\n\r\nI craved strong sweets, but those\r\nSeemed strong when I was young:\r\nThe petal of the rose\r\nIt was that stung.\r\n\r\nNow no joy but lacks salt,\r\nThat is not dashed with pain\r\nAnd weariness and fault;\r\nI crave the stain\r\n\r\nOf tears, the aftermark\r\nOf almost too much love,\r\nThe sweet of bitter bark\r\nAnd burning clove.\r\n\r\nWhen stiff and sore and scarred\r\nI take away my hand\r\nFrom leaning on it hard\r\nIn grass or sand,\r\n\r\nThe hurt is not enough:\r\nI long for weight and strength\r\nTo feel the earth as rough\r\nTo all my length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Shall Not Care \r\nby Sara Teasdale\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead and over me bright April \r\n Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, \r\nThough you shall lean above me broken-hearted, \r\n I shall not care. \r\n\r\nI shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful \r\n When rain bends down the bough; \r\nAnd I shall be more silent and cold-hearted \r\n Than you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Daffodils\r\nby Robert Herrick\r\n\r\nFair daffodils, we weep to see\r\n You haste away so soon.\r\nAs yet the early-rising sun\r\n Hath not attained his noon.\r\n Stay, stay,\r\n Until the hasting day\r\n Has run\r\n But to the even-song;\r\nAnd, having prayed together, we\r\n Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe have short time to stay, as you;\r\n We have as short a spring;\r\nAs quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n As you, or any thing.\r\n We die.\r\n As your hours do, and dry\r\n Away\r\n Like to the summer\'s rain;\r\nOr as the pearls of morning\'s dew\r\n Ne\'er to be found again.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Gail White for suggesting the inclusion of the poem\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo, Lovely Rose by Edmund Waller\r\n\r\n\r\n Go, lovely Rose,\r\nTell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n That now she knows,\r\nWhen I resemble her to thee,\r\nHow sweet and fair she seems to be.\r\n\r\n Tell her that\'s young,\r\nAnd shuns to have her graces spied,\r\n That hadst thou sprung\r\nIn deserts where no men abide,\r\nThou must have uncommended died.\r\n\r\n Small is the worth\r\nOf beauty from the light retir\'d:\r\n Bid her come forth,\r\nSuffer herself to be desir\'d,\r\nAnd not blush so to be admir\'d.\r\n\r\n Then die, that she\r\nThe common fate of all things rare\r\n May read in thee;\r\nHow small a part of time they share,\r\nThat are so wondrous sweet and fair.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Gail White for suggesting the inclusion of this\r\npoem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Ruin Falls \r\nby C. S. Lewis\r\n\r\nAll this is flashy rhetoric about loving you \r\nI never had a selfless thought since I was born.\r\nI am mercenary and self-seeking through and through;\r\nI want God, you, all friends merely to serve my turn.\r\n\r\nPeace, re-assurance, pleasure are the goals I seek;\r\nI cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin;\r\nI talk of love  a scholar\'s parrot may talk Greek,\r\nBut self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.\r\n\r\nOnly that you now have taught me (but how late!) my lack,\r\nI see the chasm; and everything you are was making\r\nMy heart into a bridge by which I might get back\r\nFrom exile and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.\r\nFor this I bless you as the ruin falls. The pains\r\nYou give me are more precious than all other gains.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to Tony Marco for suggesting the inclusion of the\r\npoem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any reward? \r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\nI am broken and bored,\r\nIs there any reward\r\nReassure me, Good Lord,\r\nAnd inform me about it.\r\nIs there any reward?\r\nI\'m beginning to doubt it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResume\r\nby Dorothy Parker\r\n\r\nRazors pain you;\r\nRivers are damp;\r\nAcids stain you;\r\nAnd drugs cause cramp.\r\nGuns aren\'t lawful;\r\nNooses give;\r\nGas smells awful;\r\nYou might as well live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBase Details \r\nby Seigfreid Sassoon\r\n\r\nIf I were fierce, and bald, and short of breath,\r\n  I\'d live with scarlet Majors at the Base,\r\nAnd speed glum heroes up the line to death.\r\n  You\'d see me with my puffy, petulant face,\r\nGuzzling and gulping in the best hotel,\r\n  Reading the Roll of Honour. \'Poor young chap,\'\r\nI\'d say  \'I used to know his father well;\r\n  Yes, we\'ve lost heavily in this last scrap.\'\r\nAnd when the war is done and youth stone dead,\r\nI\'d toddle safely home and die  in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequiem \r\nby Robert L.

There heaved a quaking\r\nOf the aborted life within him leaping,\r\nThen chest and sleepy arms once more fell slack.\r\n\r\nAnd soon the slow, stray blood came creeping\r\nFrom the intruding lead, like ants on track.\r\n\r\nWhether his deeper sleep lie shaded by the shaking\r\nOf great wings, and the thoughts that hung the stars,\r\nHigh-pillowed on calm pillows of God\'s making,\r\nAbove these clouds, these rains, these sleets of lead,\r\nAnd these winds\' scimitars,\r\n-Or whether yet his thin and sodden head\r\nConfuses more and more with the low mould,\r\nHis hair being one with the grey grass\r\nOf finished fields, and wire-scrags rusty-old,\r\nWho knows? Who hopes? Who troubles? Let it pass!\r\nHe sleeps. He sleeps less tremulous, less cold,\r\nThan we who wake, and waking say Alas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs My Team Plowing\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIs my team ploughing,\r\nThat I was used to drive\r\nAnd hear the harness jingle\r\nWhen I was man alive?\r\n\r\nAy, the horses trample,\r\nThe harness jingles now;\r\nNo change though you lie under\r\nThe land you used to plough.\r\n\r\nIs football playing\r\nAlong the river shore,\r\nWith lads to chase the leather,\r\nNow I stand up no more?\r\n\r\nAy, the ball is flying,\r\nThe lads play heart and soul;\r\nThe goal stands up, the keeper\r\nStands up to keep the goal.\r\n\r\nIs my girl happy,\r\nThat I thought hard to leave,\r\nAnd has she tired of weeping\r\nAs she lies down at eve?\r\n\r\nAy, she lies down lightly,\r\nShe lies not down to weep,\r\nYour girl is well contented.\r\nBe still, my lad, and sleep.\r\n\r\nIs my friend hearty,\r\nNow I am thin and pine,\r\nAnd has he found to sleep in\r\nA better bed than mine?\r\n\r\nYes, lad, I lie easy,\r\nI lie as lads would choose;\r\nI cheer a dead man\'s sweetheart,\r\nNever ask me whose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silent Slain \r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\nWe too, we too, descending once again \r\nThe hills of our own land, we too have heard \r\nFar off  Ah, que ce cor a longue haleine  \r\nThe horn of Roland in the passages of Spain, \r\nThe first, the second blast, the failing third, \r\nAnd with the third turned back and climbed once more \r\nThe steep road southward, and heard faint the sound \r\nOf swords, of horses, the disastrous war, \r\nAnd crossed the dark defile at last, and found \r\nAt Roncevaux upon the darkening plain \r\nThe dead against the dead and on the silent ground \r\nThe silent slain  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII  For My Funeral \r\nby A. E. Housman\r\nO thou that from thy mansion\r\n Through time and place to roam,\r\nDost send abroad thy children,\r\n And then dost call them home,\r\nThat men and tribes and nations\r\n And all thy hand hath made\r\nMay shelter them from sunshine\r\n In thine eternal shade:\r\n\r\nWe now to peace and darkness\r\n And earth and thee restore\r\nThy creature that thou madest\r\n And wilt cast forth no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring and Fall, to a Young Child \r\nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret, are you grieving \r\nOver Goldengrove unleaving? \r\nLeaves, like the things of man, you \r\nWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you? \r\nAh! as the heart grows older \r\nIt will come to such sights colder \r\nBy and by, nor spare a sigh \r\nThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie; \r\nAnd yet you will weep and know why. \r\nNow no matter, child, the name: \r\nSorrow\'s springs are the same. \r\nNor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed \r\nWhat h\xe9art h\xe9ard of, gh\xf3st gu\xe9ssed: \r\nIt is the blight man was born for, \r\nIt is Margaret you mourn for. \r\n\r\nOur thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Mole\r\nby Elinor Wylie\r\n\r\nAvoid the reeking herd, \r\nShun the polluted flock, \r\nLive like that stoic bird, \r\nThe eagle of the rock. \r\n\r\nThe huddled warmth of crowds \r\nBegets and fosters hate; \r\nHe keeps above the clouds \r\nHis cliff inviolate. \r\n\r\nWhen flocks are folded warm, \r\nAnd herds to shelter run, \r\nHe sails above the storm, \r\nHe stares into the sun. \r\n\r\nIf in the eagle\'s track \r\nYour sinews cannot leap, \r\nAvoid the lathered pack, \r\nTurn from the steaming sheep. \r\n\r\nIf you would keep your soul \r\nFrom spotted sight or sound, \r\nLive like the velvet mole: \r\nGo burrow underground. \r\n\r\nAnd there hold intercourse \r\nWith roots of trees and stones, \r\nWith rivers at their source, \r\nAnd disembodied bones.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to T. Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \r\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\r\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\r\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\r\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\r\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\r\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\r\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\r\nFor unremembered lads that not again\r\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\r\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\r\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\r\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\r\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\r\nI only know that summer sang in me\r\nA little while, that in me sings no more.Our thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \r\nby T. S. Eliot\r\n\r\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \r\nLean on a garden urn \r\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \r\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \r\nFling them to the ground and turn\r\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\nSo I would have had him leave,\r\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\nSo he would have left\r\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\nI should find\r\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\r\nSome way we both should understand,\r\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\nCompelled my imagination many days,\r\nMany days and many hours:\r\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\r\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poet\'s Testament \r\nby George Santayana\r\n\r\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\r\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\r\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\r\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\r\n\r\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\r\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\r\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\r\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\r\n\r\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\r\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\r\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\r\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\r\n\r\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\r\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\r\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\r\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\r\n\r\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\r\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\r\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\r\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of His Execution \r\naka Tichborne\'s Elegy\r\nby Chidiock Tichborne\r\n\r\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\r\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\r\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\r\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\r\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\r\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\r\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\r\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\r\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\r\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\r\n\r\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\r\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\r\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\r\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\r\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\r\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \r\nby E.

One might. But time will not relent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGathering Leaves \r\nby Robert Frost\r\n\r\nSpades take up leaves \r\nNo better than spoons, \r\nAnd bags full of leaves \r\nAre light \r\nas balloons.\r\n\r\nI make a great noise \r\nOf rustling all day \r\nLike rabbit and deer \r\nRunning away.\r\n\r\nBut the mountains I raise \r\nElude my embrace, \r\nFlowing over my arms \r\nAnd into my \r\nface.\r\n\r\nI may load and unload \r\nAgain and again \r\nTill I fill the whole shed, \r\nAnd what have \r\nI then?\r\n\r\nNext to nothing for weight, \r\nAnd since they grew duller \r\nFrom contact with earth, \r\n\r\nNext to nothing for color.\r\n\r\nNext to nothing for use. \r\nBut a crop is a crop, \r\nAnd who\'s to say where \r\nThe \r\nharvest shall stop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be \r\n\r\nby John Keats\r\n\r\nWhen I have fears that I may cease to be\r\nBefore my pen has glean\'d my teeming brain,\r\nBefore high piled books, in charact\'ry,\r\nHold like rich garners the full-ripen\'d grain;\r\nWhen I behold, upon the night\'s starr\'d face,\r\nHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\r\nAnd think that I may never live to trace\r\nTheir shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\r\nAnd when I feel, fair creature of an hour!\r\nThat I shall never look upon thee more,\r\nNever have relish in the faery power\r\nOf unreflecting love!then on the shore\r\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think\r\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dead Man Walking by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\nThey hail me as one living, \r\nBut don\'t they know \r\nThat I have died of late years, \r\nUntombed although? \r\n\r\nI am but a shape that stands here, \r\nA pulseless mould, \r\nA pale past picture, screening \r\nAshes gone cold. \r\n\r\nNot at a minute\'s warning, \r\nNot in a loud hour, \r\nFor me ceased Time\'s enchantments \r\nIn hall and bower. \r\n\r\nThere was no tragic transit, \r\nNo catch of breath, \r\nWhen silent seasons inched me \r\nOn to this death .... \r\n\r\n A Troubadour-youth I rambled \r\nWith Life for lyre, \r\nThe beats of being raging \r\nIn me like fire. \r\n\r\nBut when I practised eyeing \r\nThe goal of men, \r\nIt iced me, and I perished \r\nA little then. \r\n\r\nWhen passed my friend, my kinsfolk, \r\nThrough the Last Door, \r\nAnd left me standing bleakly, \r\nI died yet more; \r\n\r\nAnd when my Love\'s heart kindled \r\nIn hate of me, \r\nWherefore I knew not, died I \r\nOne more degree. \r\n\r\nAnd if when I died fully \r\nI cannot say, \r\nAnd changed into the corpse-thing \r\nI am to-day, \r\n\r\nYet is it that, though whiling \r\nThe time somehow \r\nIn walking, talking, smiling, \r\nI live not now. \r\n\r\nOur thanks to Tom Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorial Rain\r\nby Archibald MacLeish\r\n\r\nfor Kenneth MacLeish, 1894-1918\r\n\r\nAmbassador Puser the ambassador\r\nReminds himself in French, felicitous tongue,\r\nWhat these (young men no longer) lie here for\r\nIn rows that once, and somewhere else, were young\r\n\r\nAll night in Brussels the wind had tugged at my door:\r\nI had heard the wind at my door and the trees strung\r\nTaut, and to me who had never been before\r\nIn that country it was a strange wind, blowing\r\nSteadily, stiffening the walls, the floor,\r\nThe roof of my room. I had not slept for knowing\r\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\r\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the winds flowing\r\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\r\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\r\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\r\nListening.\r\n\r\nReflects that these enjoy\r\nTheir countrys gratitude, that deep repose,\r\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\r\nThat rest, that sleep\r\n\r\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\r\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\r\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\r\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\r\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\r\nI felt him waiting.\r\n\r\nIndicates the flag\r\nWhich (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain\r\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\r\nHave made America\r\n\r\nIn the ripe grain\r\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\r\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\r\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\r\nWaitinglistening\r\n\r\nDedicates to them\r\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\r\nA Grateful country\r\n\r\nUnder the dry grass stem\r\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\r\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\r\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\r\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\r\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\r\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\r\n\r\nThe living scatter, they run into houses, the wind\r\nIs trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again\r\nTrampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned\r\nSpurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,\r\nSeeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping\r\nBetween cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:\r\nThe earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,\r\nHe rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\r\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\r\n\r\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\'s shade,\r\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,\r\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\r\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\r\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\r\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\r\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\r\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\r\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share,\r\n\r\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\r\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\r\nHow bow\'d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\r\n\r\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\r\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\r\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\r\nThe short and simple annals of the Poor.\r\n\r\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\r\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\r\nAwaits alike th\' inevitable hour:\r\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\r\n\r\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault\r\nIf Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise,\r\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\r\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\r\n\r\nCan storied urn or animated bust\r\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\nCan Honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\nOr Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\r\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\r\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\'d,\r\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\r\n\r\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\r\nRich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\r\nChill Penury repress\'d their noble rage,\r\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\r\n\r\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene\r\nThe dark unfathom\'d caves of ocean bear:\r\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\r\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,\r\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\r\nSome Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\r\n\r\nTh\' applause of list\'ning senates to command,\r\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\r\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\r\nAnd read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\r\n\r\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone\r\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\r\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\r\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\r\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\r\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\r\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\r\n\r\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\r\nTheir sober wishes never learn\'d to stray;\r\nAlong the cool sequester\'d vale of life\r\nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.\r\n\r\nYet e\'en these bones from insult to protect\r\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\r\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck\'d,\r\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\r\n\r\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th\' unletter\'d Muse,\r\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\r\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\r\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\r\n\r\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\r\nThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resign\'d,\r\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\r\nNor cast one longing lingering look behind?\r\n\r\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\r\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\r\nE\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\r\n\r\nFor thee, who, mindful of th\' unhonour\'d dead,\r\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\r\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\r\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\r\n\r\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\r\nOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\r\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,\r\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn;\r\n\r\n\'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\r\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.\r\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\r\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\r\n\r\n\'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\r\nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;\r\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\r\nOr crazed with care, or cross\'d in hopeless love.\r\n\r\n\'One morn I miss\'d him on the custom\'d hill,\r\nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;\r\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\r\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\r\n\r\n\'The next with dirges due in sad array\r\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\r\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\r\nGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\'\r\n\r\nThe Epitaph\r\n\r\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\r\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\r\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\r\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own.\r\n\r\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\r\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\r\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\r\nHe gained from Heaven (\'twas all he wish\'d) a friend.\r\n\r\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\r\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode\r\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\r\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Death of Richard West\r\nby Thomas Gray\r\n\r\nIn vain to me the smiling Mornings shine, \r\nAnd reddening Phbus lifts his golden fire; \r\nThe birds in vain their amorous descant join; \r\nOr cheerful fields resume their green attire; \r\nThese ears, alas! for other notes repine, \r\nA different object do these eyes require; \r\nMy lonely anguish melts no heart but mine; \r\nAnd in my breast the imperfect joys expire. \r\nYet Morning smiles the busy race to cheer, \r\nAnd new-born pleasure brings to happier men; \r\nThe fields to all their wonted tribute bear; \r\nTo warm their little loves the birds complain; \r\nI fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear, \r\nAnd weep the more because I weep in
