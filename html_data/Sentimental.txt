Definitions, Examples, Characteristics, Life, Death, Bereavement and Emotion.\r\n  \r\n.style3 {\r\n\tfont-family: "Times New Roman";\r\n}\r\n.style1 {\r\n\tbackground-color: #F2EBF7;\r\n}\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n           \r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\nThe Best Sentimental Poetry of All Time:\r\nDefinitions, Characteristics and Examples\r\n\r\nIs sentimental poetry invariably bad? \r\n\r\nSentimental poetry has become the red-headed stepchild of the literary world. This is how the Wikipedia page on sentimental poetry describes the genre:\r\n\r\nSentimental poetry is a melodramatic poetic form. It is aimed primarily at \r\nstimulating the emotions rather than at communicating experience truthfully. \r\nBereavement is a common theme of sentimental poetry.\r\n\r\nThus sentimental poetry is overwrought and untruthful, and bereavement is \r\nbest avoided by serious poets! But are we hearing the whole story, the whole \r\ntruth? No, \r\nI don\'t think so. Some of the very best poets wrote intensely sentimental poems, including William Blake, \r\nLouise Bogan, Robert \r\nBurns, e. e. cummings, Emily Dickinson, John Donne, Thomas Hardy, A. E. Housman, Langston Hughes, John Keats, \r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Milton, Pablo Neruda, Sylvia Plath, Rainer \r\nMaria Rilke, Sappho, William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Alfred Tennyson, \r\nWalt Whitman, William Wordsworth, Sir Thomas Wyatt and William Butler Yeats. \r\n\r\nI agree with Nelson Algren, who said: [Sentimentality] is an indulgence in \r\nemotion. You want men and women to be good to each other and you\'re very \r\nstubborn in thinking that they want to be. Sentimentality is a kind of \r\nindulgence in this hope. I\'m not against sentimentality. I think you need it. I \r\nmean, I don\'t think you get a true picture of people without it in writing. ... \r\nIt\'s a kind of poetry, it\'s an emotional poetry, and, to bring it back to the \r\nliterary scene, I don\'t think anything is true that doesn\'t have it. \r\n\r\nI will, however, go beyond Algren and say that sentimentality is not just about \r\nwanting people to be better. It\'s often about wanting the world \r\nto be better. For instance, we look back with nostalgia at childhood days and \r\npleasures that have been lost, wishing they could be regained. And there\'s \r\nnothing wrong with that. I have long loved the song House at Pooh Corner. Yes, \r\nit\'s an unabashedly sentimental song, but it captures my own very human feelings \r\nabout my own very lost childhood. Contrary to the Wikipedia definition, it\'s a \r\nvery truthful song. And the poems on this page are \r\nvery truthful also. The first poem is about bereavement and it\'s stunningly \r\ntruthful, shatteringly truthful. Thus, I could not disagree more with the \r\nWikipedia BS.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been brainwashed to believe that sentimental poetry is invariably \r\nbad, I think there is a simple way to prove this is not true to ourselves, \r\nand that is to read the best poets. Along the way, in addition to examples, I \r\nwill provide definitions and characteristics of sentimental poetry. Now here is proof positive that some of the \r\nvery best poems in the English language are sentimental poems ...\r\n\r\n\r\ncompiled by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde wrote this poem for his sister Isola, who died at age \r\nten. \r\n\r\nRequiescat\r\nby Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nTread lightly, she is near\r\nUnder the snow,\r\nSpeak gently, she can hear\r\nThe daisies grow.\r\n\r\nAll her bright golden hair\r\nTarnished with rust,\r\nShe that was young and fair\r\nFallen to dust.\r\n\r\nLily-like, white as snow,\r\nShe hardly knew\r\nShe was a woman, so\r\nSweetly she grew.\r\n\r\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\r\nLie on her breast,\r\nI vex my heart alone,\r\nShe is at rest.\r\n\r\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\r\nLyre or sonnet,\r\nAll my life\'s buried here,\r\nHeap earth upon it.\r\n\r\nDefinitions and Characteristics\r\n\r\nDictionary definition of sentiment: One Merriam-Webster definition of \r\nsentiment is refined feeling; delicate sensibility especially as expressed in a \r\nwork of art. Thus sentiment in art can be a very good thing, in the right \r\nhands. This will be my working definition for the poems on this page. And the \r\npoems are my evidence. \r\n\r\nMy personal definition of sentimental poetry: Sentimental poetry appeals to \r\nthe emotions. One might say that it tugs at the heart strings. (This is not \r\nnecessarily bad and depends on the skill of the poet and \r\nthe likes and dislikes of individual readers.) A sentimental poem may \r\ncause readers to feel affection, sorrow, melancholy, nostalgia, tenderness, \r\napprehension, etc. \r\n\r\nMy personal definition of sentimentalism: Sentimentalism occurs in poetry when \r\npoets attempt to summon unwarranted emotion from readers. This can be due to \r\ninappropriate or unconvincing subjects, gushiness or excessive language, \r\ninsincerity, over-sincerity, whining, pleading, etc. If we call a poet a \r\nsentimentalist, we are suggesting that he/she is trying too hard to summon \r\nemotion from readers (and is probably failing). \r\n\r\nCharacteristics of sentimental poetry: A sentimental poem may have a softer \r\nfeel with softer-sounding words. For example, Music When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) by Percy Bysshe Shelley, which appears shortly on this page. A good \r\nsentimental poem will touch and/or move many readers, while a bad sentimental \r\npoem will leave many readers unmoved, nonplussed and perhaps irritated. The \r\nextent to which readers are touched and moved by what I consider to be good \r\nsentimental poems probably depends on several factors. These include, but are \r\nnot necessarily limited to: (1) the inner nature of the reader; (2) the \r\nreader\'s affinity for the subject; (3) the reader\'s personal experiences; and \r\n(4) the reader\'s personal prejudices either for or against sentiment in poetry \r\n(someone who has been convinced that sentimental poetry is automatically bad \r\nmay reject it on sight). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats\'s \r\npoems of unrequited love for the beautiful and dangerous revolutionary Maud Gonne \r\nare among the best in that genre. The first poem below is \r\na \r\nloose translation of a Ronsard poem, in which Yeats imagines the love of his \r\nlife in her later years, tending a fire. The second poem, The Wild Swans \r\nat Coole, is surely one of the most beautiful poems ever written, in any \r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen You Are Oldby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\r\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\r\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\r\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\r\n\r\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\r\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\r\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\r\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\r\n\r\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\r\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\r\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\r\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Swans at Coole\r\nby William Butler Yeats\r\n\r\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\r\nThe woodland paths are dry,\r\nUnder the October twilight the water\r\nMirrors a still sky;\r\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\r\nAre nine and fifty swans.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\r\nSince I first made my count;\r\nI saw, before I had well finished,\r\nAll suddenly mount\r\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\r\nUpon their clamorous wings.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\r\nAnd now my heart is sore.\r\nAlls changed since I, hearing at twilight,\r\nThe first time on this shore,\r\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\r\nTrod with a lighter tread.\r\n\r\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\r\nThey paddle in the cold,\r\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\r\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\r\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\r\nAttend upon them still.\r\n\r\nBut now they drift on the still water\r\nMysterious, beautiful;\r\nAmong what rushes will they build,\r\nBy what lakes edge or pool\r\nDelight mens eyes, when I awake some day\r\nTo find they have flown away?\r\n\r\n\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley may have been the most \r\nnotorious married couple of their era. He was a dashing romantic poet and \r\nheretic who wrote a tract, The Necessity of Atheism, that got him expelled \r\nfrom Oxford. She was the daughter of one of the earliest feminist \r\nwriters of note, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the liberal philosopher William \r\nGodwin. The couple spent the summer of 1816 with Lord \r\nByron. It was at this time that Mary conceived the story that became her famous \r\ngothic novel Frankenstein. Six years later, her husband drowned at sea at age thirty. \r\nAlthough he died young, Percy Bysshe Shelley is still considered to be one \r\nof the greatest English poets. Here is one especially lovely example of his \r\nwonderful touch with rhythm and rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \r\n) \r\nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\r\n\r\nMusic, when soft voices die,\r\nVibrates in the memory\r\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\r\nLive within the sense they quicken.\r\n\r\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\r\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\r\nLove itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\nLouise Bogan is not as well known today as she should be. For me she is a major \r\npoet, because of poems like After the Persian, Song for the Last Act, Roman \r\nFountain and Juan\'s Song. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong for the Last Act\r\nby Louise Bogan\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\r\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\r\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\r\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\r\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\r\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\r\nOf yet another summer loath to go\r\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\r\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\r\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\r\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\r\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\r\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\r\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\r\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\r\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\r\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\r\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\r\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\r\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\r\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\r\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\r\n\r\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\r\n\r\nIt\'s amusing to consider what the big name literary journals would do with \r\nthis lovely, touching lullaby by William Blake. I\'m sure they would reject it, \r\nbut what does that say about their understanding of poetry? I could have chosen \r\na number of other sentimental poems by Blake: The Little Black Boy, The Sick \r\nRose, or his poems about tygers, lambs and child chimneysweeps. But I\'m a fan \r\nof lullabies, and I wonder how many of the poets published by the name \r\njournals could match this one of Blake\'s. \r\n\r\nCradle Song\r\nby William Blake\r\n\r\nSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\r\nDreaming in the joys of night;\r\nSleep, sleep; in thy sleep\r\nLittle sorrows sit and weep.\r\n\r\nSweet babe, in thy face\r\nSoft desires I can trace,\r\nSecret joys and secret smiles,\r\nLittle pretty infant wiles.\r\n\r\nAs thy softest limbs I feel\r\nSmiles as of the morning steal\r\nO\'er thy cheek, and o\'er thy breast\r\nWhere thy little heart doth rest.\r\n\r\nO the cunning wiles that creep\r\nIn thy little heart asleep!\r\nWhen thy little heart doth wake,\r\nThen the dreadful night shall break.\r\n\r\nTom Merrill is one of my favorite contemporary poets, and this is one of my \r\nfavorite poems written by a living poet. \r\n\r\nCome Lord and Lift\r\nby T. Merrill\r\n\r\nCome Lord, and lift the fallen bird\r\n Abandoned on the ground;\r\nThe soul bereft and longing so\r\n To have the lost be found.\r\n\r\nThe heart that crieslet it but hear\r\n Its sweet love answering,\r\nOr out of ether one faint note\r\n Of living comfort wring.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was an early advocate of women\'s rights, and a \r\nstaunch opponent of slavery. When she married Robert Browning, theirs became the \r\nmost famous coupling in the annals of English poetry. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Love Thee?\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\n\r\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\nI love thee to the level of every day\'s\r\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\nI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\r\nI love with a passion put to use\r\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood\'s faith.\r\nI love thee with a loveIseemed to lose\r\nWithmylostsaints,I love thee with the breath,\r\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,\r\nI shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\nDylan Thomas\'s elegy to his dying father is one of the best villanelles in the English \r\nlanguage, and it remains one of the most powerful, haunting poems ever \r\nwritten in any language. \r\n\r\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\r\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\r\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\r\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\r\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\n\r\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\r\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\r\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\r\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\r\n\r\nDylan Marlais Thomas (1914-1953) despite being born in South Wales was the \r\narchetypal Romantic poet of the popular American imaginationhe was flamboyantly \r\ntheatrical, a heavy drinker, engaged in roaring disputes in public, and read his \r\nwork aloud with tremendous depth of feeling and a singing Welsh lilt.\r\n\r\nFern Hill\r\nby Dylan Thomas\r\n\r\nNow as I was young and easy under the apple boughs\r\nAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,\r\n The night above the dingle starry,\r\n Time let me hail and \r\nclimb\r\n Golden in the heydays of his eyes,\r\nAnd honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns\r\nAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves\r\n Trail with daisies and \r\nbarley\r\n Down the rivers of the windfall light.\r\n\r\nAnd as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns\r\nAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,\r\n In the sun that is young once only,\r\n Time let me play and be\r\n\r\n Golden in the mercy of his means,\r\nAnd green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves\r\nSang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,\r\n And the sabbath rang \r\nslowly\r\n In the pebbles of the holy streams.\r\n\r\nAll the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay\r\nFields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air\r\n And playing, lovely and watery\r\n And fire green as grass.\r\n And nightly under the simple stars\r\nAs I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,\r\nAll the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars\r\n Flying with the ricks, and the horses\r\n Flashing into the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white\r\nWith the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all\r\n Shining, it was Adam and maiden,\r\n The sky gathered again\r\n And the sun grew round that very day.\r\nSo it must have been after the birth of the simple light\r\nIn the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm\r\n Out of the whinnying green stable\r\n On to the fields of \r\npraise.\r\n\r\nAnd honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house\r\nUnder the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,\r\n In the sun born over and over,\r\n I ran my heedless ways,\r\n My wishes raced through the house high hay\r\nAnd nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows\r\nIn all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs\r\n Before the children green and golden\r\n Follow him out of grace,\r\n\r\nNothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me\r\nUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,\r\n In the moon that is always rising,\r\n Nor that riding to sleep\r\n I should hear him fly with the high fields\r\nAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.\r\nOh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,\r\n Time held me green and \r\ndying\r\n Though I sang in my chains like the sea.\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti\'s sister Christina was also a poet, and perhaps the \r\nbetter of the two. \r\n\r\n\r\nSong\r\nby Christina Rossetti\r\n\r\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\r\n Sing no sad songs for me;\r\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\r\n Nor shady cypress tree:\r\nBe the green grass above me\r\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\r\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\r\n And if thou wilt, forget.\r\n\r\nI shall not see the shadows,\r\n I shall not feel the rain;\r\nI shall not hear the nightingale\r\n Sing on, as if in pain:\r\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\r\n That doth not rise nor set,\r\nHaply I may remember,\r\n And haply may forget.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunbar was one of the first great Scottish poets, and is also known for \r\nhis poem Lament for the Makiris (Lament for the Makers, or Poets). \r\n\r\nSweet Rose of Virtue\r\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\r\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue. \r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been. \r\n\r\nConrad Aiken was one of the sweetest singers among American poets. \r\n\r\nBread and Music\r\nby Conrad Aiken\r\n\r\nMusic I heard with you was more than music,\r\nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread;\r\nNow that I am without you, all is desolate;\r\nAll that was once so beautiful is dead.\r\n\r\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver,\r\nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass.\r\nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d,\r\nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass.\r\n\r\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them,\r\nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes;\r\nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\r\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\r\n\r\nD. H. Lawrence is better known today for his novels, which include the \r\nthen-infamous Lady Chatterley\'s Lover, but he was also one of the better \r\nearly modernist poets. \r\n\r\nPiano \r\nby D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\r\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\r\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\r\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\r\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\r\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\r\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\r\n\r\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\r\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\r\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\r\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote his share of sentimental poetry. This has long been \r\none of my favorite poems of his. \r\n\r\n\r\nFull Fathom Five\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\r\n Of his bones are coral made;\r\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n Nothing of him that doth fade\r\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\r\nInto something rich and strange.\r\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\r\n Ding-dong.\r\nHark! now I hear them  ding-dong, bell.\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson was the most famous of the British Poet Laureates. He is \r\nremembered for short lyric poems like The Eagle and Crossing the Bar, for \r\noccasional poems like The Charge of the Light Brigade, and for longer works \r\nlike Ulysses and In Memoriam A.H.H. \r\n\r\nTears, Idle Tears\r\nby Lord Alfred Tennyson\r\n\r\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\r\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\nSad as the last which reddens over one\r\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nAh, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\r\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nDear as remembered kisses after death,\r\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\r\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was one of the best writers of sentimental poems and songs. He is \r\nmost famous today for one of the most sentimental songs of all time, Auld Lang \r\nSyne. \r\n\r\n\r\nA Red, Red Rose\r\n\r\nby Robert Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nOh my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\nThat\'s newly sprung in June:\r\nOh my luve is like the melodie,\r\nThat\'s sweetly play\'d in tune.\r\n\r\nAs fair art thou, my bonie lass,\r\nSo deep in luve am I;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\nTill a\' the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\nAnd the rocks melt wi\' the sun;\r\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\nWhile the sands o\' life shall run.\r\n\r\nAnd fare thee weel, my only luve!\r\nAnd fare thee weel a while!\r\nAnd I will come again, my luve,\r\nTho\' it were ten thousand mile!\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth Frye is, perhaps, the most mysterious poet who appears on this \r\npage, and perhaps in the annals of poetry. Rather than spoiling the mystery, I \r\nwill present her poem first, then provide the details ...\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\r\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\r\n\r\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\r\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\r\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\r\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\r\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\r\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\r\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\r\nI am the swift uplifting rush\r\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\r\nI am the soft starshine at night.\r\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\r\nI am not there; I did not die.\r\n\r\nThis consoling elegy had a \r\nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by a \r\nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \r\nthree. As far as we know, she had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \r\nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \r\nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \r\nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave. When the poem was named Britain\'s \r\nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \r\ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \r\nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \r\nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \r\norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \r\nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \r\nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \r\nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \r\nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \r\nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \r\nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself.\r\n\r\nRelated pages:\r\nPerfect Poems,\r\nThe Best Sonnets,\r\nThe Best Villanelles,\r\n\r\nThe Best Ballads,\r\nThe Best Sestinas,\r\nThe Best Rondels and Roundels,\r\n\r\nThe Best Kyrielles,\r\nThe Best Couplets,\r\nThe Best Haiku,\r\n\r\nThe Best Poem of All Time,\r\n\r\nThe Best Limericks,\r\n\r\nThe Best Nonsense Verse,\r\n\r\nThe Best \r\nLight Verse,\r\nThe Best Poems Ever Written, \r\nThe Best Poets,\r\nThe Best of the Masters,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Poems in the English Language,\r\nThe Most Popular Poems of All Time,\r\nThe Best American Poetry,\r\nThe Best Poetry Translations,\r\nThe Best Ancient Greek Epigrams and Epitaphs,\r\nThe Best Anglo-Saxon Riddles and Kennings,\r\nThe Best Old English Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Lyric Poetry,\r\nThe Best Free Verse, \r\nThe Best Story Poems,\r\nThe Best Narrative Poems,\r\nThe Best Epic Poems,\r\nThe Best Epigrams,\r\nThe Best Poems for Kids,\r\n\r\nThe Most Beautiful Lines in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Quatrains Ever,\r\nThe Most Beautiful Sonnets in the English Language,\r\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments,\r\nThe Best Holocaust Poetry,\r\nThe Best Hiroshima Poetry,\r\nThe Best Anti-War Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Religious Poetry,\r\nThe Best Spiritual Poetry, \r\nThe Best Heretical Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Thanksgiving Poems,\r\nThe Best Autumnal Poems,\r\nThe Best Fall/Autumn Poetry, \r\n\r\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\r\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\r\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\r\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\r\nThe Best Vampire Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Love Poems,\r\nThe Best Urdu Love Poetry, \r\nThe Best Erotic Poems,\r\nThe Best Romantic Poetry,\r\nThe Best Love Songs,\r\n\r\nThe Ten Greatest Poems Ever Written,\r\nThe Greatest Movies of All Time,\r\nVisions of Beauty,\r\nThe Best Poems about Death and Loss,\r\nWhat is Poetry?,\r\nThe Best Abstract Poetry,\r\n\r\nThe Best Antinatalist Poems and Prose,\r\nEngland\'s Greatest Artists,\r\nThe Best Book Titles of All Time,\r\nEarly Poems: The Best Juvenilia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HyperTexts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
