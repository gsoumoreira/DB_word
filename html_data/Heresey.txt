Candidates include Al-Ma\'arri (an \r\nantinatalist Arab poet who rejected Islam and all other religions), the Archpoet (a \r\nmedieval Latin poet who may have been the first rogue scholar), William Blake \r\n(the English mystic who had visions of angels and saints, but called Jehovah, \r\nthe biblical god, \r\nNobodaddy), Robert Burns, Lord Byron, Thomas Chatterton, Samuel Taylor \r\nColeridge, e. e. cummings, W. H. Davies, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Hafiz, \r\nA. E. Housman, Samuel Johnson, John Keats, Philip Larkin, Tom Merrill, Edna St. Vincent Millay, \r\nRichard Moore, Edgar Allan Poe, Rumi, \r\nWilliam Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, King Solomon (a hedonist, fatalist, \r\nantinatalist \r\nand apparent nonbeliever according to the Bible), Wallace Stevens, Lord Alfred \r\nTennyson, Walt Whitman, William Wordsworth and William Butler Yeats. \r\n\r\nWe dedicate this page to the memory of Paul Christian Stevens, who published \r\nheresies by contemporary poets as the editor of The Flea, The \r\nChimaera and Shit Creek Review. \r\n\r\nIf you quail to hear God\'s name used in vain, or to see his allegedly sterling \r\nreputation tarnished, it\'s best not to enter, for here there be Dragons. On \r\nthe other hand, please don\'t be too quick to draw the obvious conclusions. \r\nSome of the poets published here have also written devotional poetry. Also, \r\nplease allow me to submit that any heresy uttered here pales in comparison to \r\nwhat most Christians believe and say about God.\r\nWho, we ask, are the real blasphemers?  poets who satirize the ludicrous images of God perpetrated on the world by religion, or \r\nChristian priests and pastors who preach and teach that Einstein, Gandhi, the Dalai Lama, gays, a billion Hindus, a billion Muslims, and millions of \r\nsuffering souls in places like Darfur, Haiti and Bangladesh will all go to an eternal hell \r\nfor not believing Christian dogma, when a close examination of the Bible proves hell to be an \r\nancient fraud? I can offer strong evidence that the Bible does not teach the dogma of an eternal hell, which was \r\nnever mentioned by the God of the Bible or any of \r\nthe Hebrew prophets. If you care to read my logical proof that there is \r\nno hell, according to the Bible itself, you can do \r\nso by clicking here. If \r\nyou prefer poetry to theology, have at it!  Michael R.

In the book of Ecclesiastes, the wisest of men said: A \r\nman hath no preeminence above a beast, for all is vanity. The NIV translates \r\nVanity, vanity, all is vanity! as Utterly meaningless! Everything is \r\nmeaningless! Thus the wisest of men did not agree with your local priests \r\nand pastors. One side or the other may be correct, but they can\'t both be \r\ncorrect, and thus the Bible cannot be the inerrant word of an all-wise God, \r\nwho would know the real score and man\'s ultimate end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilly Nilly\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor the Demiurge, aka Yahweh/Jehovah \r\n \r\n\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nYou made the stallion,you made the filly,and now they sleepin the dark earth, stilly.Isnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?You forced them to runall their days uphilly.\r\nThey ran till they dropped\r\nlifes a pickle, dilly.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\nThey say I should worship you!\r\nOh, really!\r\nThey say I should pray\r\nso youll not act illy.\r\nIsnt it silly, Willy Nilly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived according to the Bible, was an \r\nantinatalist who said it is better for human beings not to be born: So I returned, and \r\nconsidered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears \r\nof such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their \r\noppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. Wherefore I praised the \r\ndead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, \r\nbetter is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil \r\nwork that is done under the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Be The Verse \r\nby Philip Larkin\r\n\r\nThey fuck you up, your mum and dad. \r\nThey may not mean to, but they do. \r\nThey fill you with the faults they had \r\nAnd add some extra, just for you. \r\n\r\nBut they were fucked up in their turn \r\nBy fools in old-style hats and coats, \r\nWho half the time were soppy-stern \r\nAnd half at one another\'s throats. \r\n\r\nMan hands on misery to man. \r\nIt deepens like a coastal shelf. \r\nGet out as early as you can, \r\nAnd don\'t have any kids yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. \r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarouse, ye sovereign lords! The wheel will roll\r\nForever to confound and to console:\r\nWho sips to-day the golden cup will drink\r\nMayhap to-morrow in a wooden bowl \r\n\r\nAnd silent drink. The tumult of our mirth\r\nIs worse than our mad welcoming of birth: \r\nThe thunder hath a grandeur, but the rains,\r\nWithout the thunder, quench the thirst of Earth.\r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn God We Trust\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nAbsolve yourselves, believe them saved,\r\nWhom hungrily you brought to fare\r\nAs chance decrees, and leave to them\r\nThe fortune to which you rose heir.\r\nNow theirs shall be the kingdom too,\r\nThis one and that, and all they hold,\r\nAll marvels present, and as well\r\nFresh wonders when the flesh turns cold.\r\n\r\nAll you who by blind pulse renew\r\nThe primal blessing cast in heat,\r\nAnd to a season\'s course entrust\r\nFrail issue weather can defeat,\r\nWho from flung seed grew anxious too\r\nDeny earth feeds on them and you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bible\'s wisest man, King Solomon, denied that there was anything to look \r\nforward to after death: Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy \r\nmight; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the \r\ngrave, whither thou goest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO fools, awake! The rites ye sacred hold\r\nAre but a cheat contrived by men of old\r\nWho lusted after wealth and gained their lust\r\nAnd died in basenessand their law is dust.\r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Brief Alarm\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nLike everything, this too will soon be lost,\r\nForever out of sight and out of mind,\r\nA brief alarm resorbed into the sum\r\nOf passing things that leave no trace behind.\r\nFor its duration, it would summon all\r\nTo a restraint heroicto be brave\r\nBeyond all generations gone before,\r\nAnd make a sacrifice more sure to save:\r\n\r\nTo starve the ground, and lay no further feast\r\nFor bloated Earth\'s unflagging appetite,\r\nBut be content to plow redemptively\r\nA barren field in which no seed seeks light\r\nAnd make your plots the last wherein to toss\r\nA harvest raised for neverending loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf making many books [such as the Bible]thereis no end; and much studyisa \r\nweariness of the flesh.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Would Santa Claus Say\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhat would Santa Claus say, \r\nI wonder,\r\nabout Jesus returning \r\nto Kill and Plunder?\r\nFor hell likely return\r\non Christmas Day\r\nto blow the bad\r\nlittle boys away!\r\nWhen He flashes like lightning\r\nacross the skies\r\nand many a homosexual\r\ndies,\r\nwhen the harlots and heretics\r\nare ripped asunder,\r\nwhat will the Easter Bunny think,\r\nI wonder?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance \r\nof things that are to come with those that shall come after.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI - Easter Hymn\r\nby A. E. Housman\r\n\r\nIf in that Syrian garden, ages slain,\r\nYou sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,\r\nNor even in dreams behold how dark and bright\r\nAscends in smoke and fire by day and night\r\nThe hate you died to quench and could but fan,\r\nSleep well and see no morning, son of man.\r\n\r\nBut if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,\r\nAt the right hand of majesty on high\r\nYou sit, and sitting so remember yet\r\nYour tears, your agony and bloody sweat,\r\nYour cross and passion and the life you gave,\r\nBow hither out of heaven and see and save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled \r\nwith hearing. \r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npretty pickle\r\nby Michael R.

H. Davies\r\n\r\nWhat do we earn for all our gentle grace?\r\nA body stiff and cold from foot to face.\r\n\r\nIf you have beauty, what is beauty worth?\r\nA mask to hide it, made of common earth.\r\n\r\nWhat do we get for all our song and prattle?\r\nA gasp for longer breath, and then a rattle.\r\n\r\nWhat do we earn for dreams, and our high teaching?\r\nThe worms\' contempt, that have no time for preaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the labor of Man is for his mouth, and yet his appetite is not filled.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls \r\nby e. e. cummings\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls\r\nare unbeautiful and have comfortable minds\r\n(also, with the church\'s protestant blessings\r\ndaughters, unscented shapeless spirited)\r\nthey believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,\r\nare invariably interested in so many things\r\nat the present writing one still finds\r\ndelighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?\r\nperhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy\r\nscandal of Mrs. N and Professor D\r\n.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above\r\nCambridge if sometimes in its box of\r\nsky lavender and cornerless, the\r\nmoon rattles like a fragment of angry candy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to \r\nthe wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; \r\nbut time and chance happeneth to them all.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Supermarket in California\r\nby Allen Ginsberg\r\n\r\nWhat thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, \r\nfor I walked down the\r\nstreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious \r\nlooking at the full moon.\r\nIn my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I \r\nwent into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!\r\nWhat peaches and what penumbras! Whole families \r\nshopping at night! Aisles\r\nfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the \r\ntomatoes!  and you,\r\nGarcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the \r\nwatermelons?\r\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old \r\ngrubber, poking among the\r\nmeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\r\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the \r\npork chops? What price\r\nbananas? Are you my Angel?\r\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of \r\ncans following you, and\r\nfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.\r\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our \r\nsolitary fancy tasting\r\nartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never \r\npassing the cashier.\r\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in \r\nan hour. Which way does\r\nyour beard point tonight?\r\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the \r\nsupermarket and feel\r\nabsurd.)\r\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The \r\ntrees add shade to\r\nshade, lights out in the houses, we\'ll both be lonely.\r\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love \r\npast blue automobiles in\r\ndriveways, home to our silent cottage?\r\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old \r\ncourage-teacher, what America did you\r\nhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out \r\non a smoking bank and\r\nstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of \r\nLethe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that \r\nwhich now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise \r\nman?As the fool.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Missionary\'s Position\r\nby Joseph S. Salemi\r\n\r\nI maintain it all was for the best\r\nWe hacked our way through jungle and sought out\r\nThese savage children, painted and half-dressed,\r\nTo set their minds at ease, and dispel doubt.\r\n\r\nConcerning what? Why, God\'s immense design,\r\nAnd how it governs all we do and see.\r\nBefore, they had no sense of the divine\r\nBeyond the sticks and bones of sorcery.\r\n\r\nGranted, they are more somber and subdued,\r\nKnowing that lives are watched, and judged, and weighed.\r\nSubject to fits of melancholy mood,\r\nThey look upon the cross, and are afraid.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have me say? We preached the Word\r\nBetter endured in grief than left unheard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth \r\nthem: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so \r\nthat a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf God\r\nis good,\r\nhalf the Bible\r\nis libel.\r\nMichael R.

Who\r\nlays claim to know the name of You?\r\nYour armies vie to shout your name,\r\nreplete with certainty and bile.\r\nThe women hide their heads in shame.\r\nIts you I blame. Your work is vile.\r\nWhatever caused young love to glow,\r\nand buttercups in dewy grass,\r\nand trees to rustle, streams to flow,\r\nit wasnt you, you horses arse.\r\nYou are the baby in the lab\r\nwith test tubes strewn across the floor.\r\nWith random goofiness, you grab\r\nthe nearest toy and roar for more.\r\nLarger forces have no time\r\nto notice our catastrophe.\r\nThe mathematics is sublime.\r\nWe are your past apostasy.\r\nThe broken eggs you cracked and used\r\nto make an omelette, and we grow\r\nwith you, ambitious and confused,\r\nperformers in your cooking show.\r\nYet every morning hearts expand,\r\nthough heads can never understand.\r\n\r\nOriginally Published in The Flea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. \r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn His Kingdom of Corpses\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\r\nGod has been heard to speak\r\nin many enraged discourses,\r\nhigh, high from some mountain peak\r\nwhere Hes lectured man on compassion\r\nwhile the sparrows around Him fell,\r\nand babes, for His meager ration\r\nof rain, died and went to hell,\r\nunbaptized, for thats His fashion.\r\n\r\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\r\nGod has been heard to vent\r\nin many obscure discourses\r\non the need for man to repent,\r\nto admit that hes a sinner;\r\ngive up sex, and riches, and fame;\r\nbe disciplined at his dinner\r\nthough always he dies the same,\r\nwhether fatter or thinner.\r\n\r\nIn his kingdom of corpses,\r\nGod has been heard to speak\r\nin many absurd discourses\r\nof mans Ego, precipitous Peak!,\r\nwhile demanding praise and worship,\r\nand the bending of every knee.\r\nAnd though He sounds like the Devil,\r\nall religious men now agree\r\nHe loves them indubitably.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by The Chimaera and Lucid Rhythms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMan must return to his long home (the earth, when he lies in the grave) ...\r\n\r\nIn the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and \r\nthe strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are \r\nfew, and those that look out of the windows be darkened. And the doors shall be \r\nshut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up \r\nat the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; \r\nAlsowhenthey shall be afraid ofthat which ishigh, and fearsshall bein the \r\nway, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, \r\nand desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go \r\nabout the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be \r\nbroken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the \r\ncistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall \r\nreturn unto God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is \r\nvanity.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\nDeaths and losses are the calamities by which Providence gradually disengages \r\nus from the love of life.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grump\'s Apology\r\nby Richard Moore\r\n\r\nMy tongue is rough, you find.\r\nMy tongue replies:\r\nThe truth is, though unkind,\r\nkinder than lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn much wisdom there is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth \r\nsorrow.\r\nKing Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIve got Jesuss face on a wallet insert\r\nby Michael R.

Well,\r\nCan\'t the mind do duty?\r\n\r\nHard beyond all hardness, this\r\nMastering of Nature:\r\nWho shall say his heart is clean,\r\nNear so fair a creature?\r\nYoung are we, so hard a law,\r\nHow should we obey it?\r\nAnd our bodies, they are young,\r\nShall they have no say int?\r\n\r\nSit you down amid the fire,\r\nWill the fire not burn you?\r\nTo Pavia come, will you\r\nJust as chaste return you?\r\nPavia, where Beauty draws\r\nYouth with finger-tips,\r\nYouth entangled in her eyes,\r\nRavished with her lips.\r\n\r\nLet you bring Hippolytus,\r\nIn Pavia dine him,\r\nNever more Hippolytus\r\nWill the morning find him.\r\nIn Pavia not a road\r\nBut leads to venery\r\nNor among its crowding towers\r\nOne to chastity.\r\n\r\nYet a second charge they bring:\r\nI\'m forever gaming.\r\nYea, the dice hath many a time\r\nStripped me to my shaming\r\nWhen an if the body\'s cold,\r\nIf the mind is burning,\r\nOn the anvil hammering,\r\nRhymes and verses turning?\r\n\r\nLook again upon your list. \r\nIs the tavern on it? \r\nYea, and never have I scorned,\r\nNever shall I scorn it,\r\nTill the holy angels come,\r\nAnd my eyes discern them, \r\nSinging for the dying soul, \r\nRequiem aeternam.\r\n\r\nFor on this my heart is set: \r\nWhen the hour is nigh me, \r\nLet me in the tavern die, \r\nWith a tankard by me, \r\nWhile the angels looking down \r\nJoyously sing o\'er me, \r\nDeus sit propitius \r\nHuic potatori.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the fire that\'s in the cup\r\nKindles the soul\'s torches,\r\nTis the heart that drenched in wine\r\nFlies to heaven\'s porches.\r\nSweeter tastes the wine to me\r\nIn a tavern tankard\r\nThat the watered stuff my Lord\r\nBishop has decanted.\r\n\r\nLet them fast and water drink,\r\nAll the poets\' chorus,\r\nFly the market and the crowd\r\nRacketing uproarious.\r\nSit in quiet spots and think,\r\nShun the tavern\'s portal\r\nWrite, and never having lived,\r\nDie to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNever hath the spirit of\r\nPoetry descended,\r\nTill with food and drink my lean\r\nBelly was distended,\r\nBut when Bacchus lords it in\r\nMy cerebral story,\r\nComes Apollo with a rush,\r\nFills me with his glory.\r\n\r\nUnto every man his gift.\r\nMine was not for fasting.\r\nNever could I find a rhyme\r\nWith my stomach wasting.\r\nAs the wine is, so the verse:\r\n\'Tis a better chorus\r\nWhen the landlord hath a good \r\nVintage set before us.\r\n\r\nGood my lord, the case is heard,\r\nI myself betray me,\r\nAnd affirm myself to be\r\nAll my fellows say me.\r\nSee, they in thy presence are:\r\nLet whoeer hath known\r\nHis own heart and found it clean,\r\nCast at me the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! let them in the marshes grope, or ride\r\nTheir jaded Myths along the mountain-side;\r\nCome up with me, O Brother, to the heights\r\nWhere Reason is the prophet and the guide.\r\n\r\nWhat is thy faith and creed, they ask of me,\r\nAnd who art thou? Unseal thy pedigree. \r\nI am the child of Time, my tribe, mankind,\r\nAnd now this world\'s my caravanseri.\r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind Enemy Lines\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\n\r\nI have learned that to bewith those I like\r\n is enough.Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nSpotted wheredropped, its neat, unread\r\nStill folded pages testified\r\nI\'d been afloat inside my head,\r\nSo buoyed by a presence I\'d\r\nEscaped resorting to the trends,\r\nOr tracking our squirearchy\'s scheme\r\nFor locking my more wayward friends\r\nOut of the landscape of their dream.\r\n\r\nThenlift for liftI\'d played chauffeur\r\nSlipped out an outcast whoslips in\r\nAnd braves the backlash of the pure\r\nTo smuggle me my favorite sin\r\nOrjust pass out a room away\r\nWhile I drift in my mind all day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn One Ear\r\nby Joseph S.

At the best\r\nWe may listen, be impressed,\r\nMarvel at sagacious wit\r\nThen go act as we see fit.\r\nMind and will stay far apart;\r\nReason does not touch the heart;\r\nImpulse shatters logic\'s

right;\r\nLaugh, heart, again in the grey twilight;\r\nSigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.\r\n\r\nYour mother Eire is always young,\r\nDew ever shining and twilight grey;\r\nThough hope fall from you and love decay,\r\nBurning in fires of a slanderous tongue.\r\n\r\nCome, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:\r\nFor there the mystical brotherhood\r\nOf sun and moon and hollow and wood\r\nAnd river and stream work out their will;\r\n\r\nAnd God stands winding His lonely horn,\r\nAnd time and the world are ever in flight;\r\nAnd love is less kind than the grey twilight,\r\nAnd hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath\'s debt is then and there\r\nPaid down by dying men;\r\nBut it is a promise bare\r\nThat they shall rise again.\r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Seasons Sound\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nI speak to them, I notice, in my strange\r\nYet native tongue, and let them guess what\'s new\r\nWhere out beyond the mythic land I range\r\nAnd storied wonders cannot gloss the view.\r\nSo some against annulment preen their sound,\r\nAs if all slates were not to be wiped clean\r\nOr honers of a bloodgift were less bound\r\nFor all their fanfare never to have been.\r\nSo seasons sound their trumpets and subside,\r\nInflate and wizen for sweet nature\'s sake,\r\nAnd while swung oceans fling to either side\r\nThe latest chosen for a foamy wake\r\nThe news still spreads our goose is hard to cook\r\nAnd no blank page will mark us in Time\'s book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a man of sound judgment appeals to his intelligence, he will \r\nhold cheap the various creeds and despise them. \r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Demurral\r\nby Tom Merrill\r\n\r\nWhy keep your senses grounded here,\r\nOr let them have you sharp and clear\r\n\r\nWho wakened you to numbered days\r\nTo yoke you to their futile ways?\r\n\r\nWhile tickings winch you nearer toward\r\nYour execution and reward,\r\n\r\nWhy not imbibeor pick your trip,\r\nLet them ram home the standard script\r\n\r\nAs you, absorbing what you like\r\nRisk transport on a one-way flight;\r\n\r\nLet our grand architects complain,\r\nWho pull their mighty weight in vain,\r\n\r\nOnly to end as they began,\r\nFragile freight of a circling hand\r\n\r\nThat flicks the feeble out and in\r\nAnd each back to his origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\r\n\r\nOh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the Wise\r\nTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;\r\n One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;\r\nThe Flower that once has blown forever dies.\r\n\r\nMyself when young did eagerly frequent\r\nDoctor and Saint, and heard great Argument\r\n About it and about; but evermore\r\nCame out by the same Door as in I went.\r\n\r\nWith them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,\r\nAnd with my own hand labour\'d it to grow:\r\n And this was all the Harvest that I reap\'d \r\n\'I came like Water and like Wind I go.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pelagian Drinking Song \r\n\r\nby Hillaire Belloc\r\n\r\nPelagius lived at Kardanoel\r\nAnd taught a doctrine there\r\nHow, whether you went to heaven or to hell\r\nIt was your own affair.\r\nIt had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,\r\nBut was your own affair.\r\n\r\nNo, he didn\'t believe\r\nIn Adam and Eve\r\nHe put no faith therein!\r\nHis doubts began\r\nWith the Fall of Man\r\nAnd he laughed at Original Sin.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nHe laughed at original sin.\r\n\r\nThen came the bishop of old Auxerre\r\nGermanus was his name\r\nHe tore great handfuls out of his hair\r\nAnd he called Pelagius shame.\r\nAnd with his stout Episcopal staff\r\nSo thoroughly whacked and banged\r\nThe heretics all, both short and tall \r\nThey rather had been hanged.\r\n\r\nOh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long\r\nUpon each and all occasions\r\nTill they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nTheir orthodox persuasions.\r\n\r\nNow the faith is old and the Devil bold\r\nExceedingly bold indeed.\r\nAnd the masses of doubt that are floating about\r\nWould smother a mortal creed.\r\nBut we that sit in a sturdy youth\r\nAnd still can drink strong ale\r\nLet us put it away to infallible truth\r\nThat always shall prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd thank the Lord\r\nFor the temporal sword\r\nAnd howling heretics too.\r\nAnd all good things\r\nOur Christendom brings\r\nBut especially barley brew!\r\nWith my row-ti-tow\r\nTi-oodly-ow\r\nEspecially barley brew!\r\n\r\n\r\nImmortal wouldst thou be, then draw no breath: \r\nThis life is but a ladder unto death. \r\nAl-Ma\'arri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficially Speaking\r\nby\r\nTom Merrill\r\n\r\nWhat nugget gleaned may we bestow\r\nTo mark the passing of the torch\r\nWho watch the darkness watch us go\r\nSteaming across a lamp-lit porch.\r\nA few steps off our haloed stage\r\nThe boundless night with sealed lips\r\nCounts out the customary wage:\r\nAn ineluctable eclipse.\r\n\r\nIt comes to us in daily thought\r\nAnd haunts us every day we breathe,\r\nHow we without a hope have sought\r\nTo love where we could only grieve\r\nAnd only honed a skill so wise\r\nTo take a sage to his demise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone by Edgar Alan Poe\r\n\r\nFrom childhood\'s hour I have not been\r\nAs others were; I have not seen\r\nAs others saw; I could not bring\r\nMy passions from a common spring.\r\nFrom the same source I have not taken\r\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\r\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\r\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\r\nThenin my childhood, in the dawn\r\nOf a most stormy lifewas drawn\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\r\nThe mystery which binds me still:\r\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\r\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\r\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\r\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\r\nFrom the lightning in the sky\r\nAs it passed me flying

Satan says, Cor!\r\nHow did the British ever win the war?\r\n\r\nOriginally Published in The Flea\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion on a college thermodynamics exam: Is hell exothermic or \r\nendothermic? Support your answer with proof. Most of the students wrote proofs \r\nof their beliefs using Boyle\'s Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote \r\nthe following:\r\n\tFirst, We postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. \r\n\tIf they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are \r\n\tsouls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think we can \r\n\tsafely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. \r\n\tAs for souls entering hell, most religions state that if you do not \r\n\tbelong to their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are many \r\n\treligions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project \r\n\tthat all people and souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they \r\n\tare, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially.\r\n\tNow, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle\'s Law states \r\n\tthat in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the \r\n\tratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. Two options \r\n\texist:\r\n\t\tIf hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls \r\n\t\tenter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase \r\n\t\tuntil all hell breaks loose. \r\n\t\tIf hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in \r\n\t\thell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes \r\n\t\tover.\r\n\t\r\n\tSo which is it? If we accept the quote given to me by [name withheld] \r\n\tduring Freshman year, that it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep \r\n\twith you and take into account the fact that I still have NOT succeeded in \r\n\thaving sex with her, then Option 2 cannot be true ... Thus, hell is \r\n\texothermic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeast 666\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n... what rough beast ... slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?W. B.
