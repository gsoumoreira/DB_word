Burch Erotic Poems\r\n\r\nThese are the best erotic poems and translations of the American poet Michael R. \r\nBurch. Most of these poems are naughty or risqu\xe9 rather than \r\ngraphic. Erotic poems can come in all shapes, sizes and forms: haiku, tanka, \r\nepigrams, couplets, limericks, sonnets, rondels, roundels, villanelles, free verse, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleyre Le Coucher de Sappho \r\nby Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 42\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nEros harrows my heart:\r\nwild winds whipping desolate mountains,\r\nuprooting oaks.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with this erotic little number many years ago, and ended up \r\ntranslating it myself. Here, Sappho of Lesbos conveys the elemental nature of \r\nEros, the Greek god of sexual love and lust. Our term erotic derives from the name \r\nEros, just as our terms sapphic and lesbian derive from Sappho\'s name and \r\nthe name of her island home. Interestingly, Eros was the son of \r\nAphrodite (the goddess of love) and Ares (the god of war)! And in this poem love \r\ndoes sound like a battlefield, to borrow a phrase from Pat Benatar. I believe Sappho is telling us that she can\'t always control the way she \r\nfeels, or what happens when she falls in love. Oscar Wilde once said that he \r\ncould resist everything but temptation. William Blake opined that only people \r\nwith weak passions \r\ncan control them. Robert Herrick said that he was bewitched by a \r\nglimpse of his lover\'s underwear. Thus, some of the greatest love poets seem to agree that lust is a force beyond our ability to resist!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSappho, fragment 155\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nA short revealing frock?\r\nIt\'s just my luck\r\nyour lips were made to mock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegligibles\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nShow me your most intimate items of apparel; \r\nbegin with the hem of your quicksilver slip ... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarming Her Pearls\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nfor Beth\r\n\r\nWarming her pearls, \r\nher breasts gleam like constellations. \r\nHer belly is a bit rotund ... \r\nshe might have stepped out of a Rubens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Effects of Memory\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nA black ringlet\r\ncurls to lie\r\nat the nape of her neck,\r\nglistening with sweat\r\nin the evaporate moonlight ...\r\nThis is what I remember\r\n\r\nnow that I cannot forget.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight,\r\nif I have forgotten her name,\r\nI remember:\r\nrigid wire and white lace\r\nhalf-impressed in her flesh ...\r\n\r\nour soft cries, like regret,\r\n\r\n... the enameled white clips\r\nof her bra strap\r\nstill inscribe dimpled marks\r\nthat my kisses erase ...\r\n\r\nnow that I have forgotten her face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Balcon (The Balcony)\r\nby Charles Baudelaire\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nParamour of memory, ultimate mistress,\r\nsource of all pleasure, my only desire;\r\nhow can I forget your ecstatic caresses,\r\nthe warmth of your breasts by the roaring fire,\r\nparamour of memory, ultimate mistress?\r\nEach night illumined by the burning coals\r\nwe lay together where the rose-fragrance clings\r\nhow soft your breasts, how tender your soul!\r\nAh, and we said imperishable things,\r\neach night illumined by the burning coals.\r\nHow beautiful the sunsets these sultry days,\r\ndeep space so profound, beyond lifes brief floods ...\r\nthen, when I kissed you, my queen, in a daze,\r\nI thought I breathed the bouquet of your blood\r\nas beautiful as sunsets these sultry days.\r\nNight thickens around us like a wall;\r\nin the deepening darkness our irises meet.\r\nI drink your breath, ah! poisonous yet sweet!,\r\nas with fraternal hands I massage your feet\r\nwhile night thickens around us like a wall.\r\nI have mastered the sweet but difficult art\r\nof happiness here, with my head in your lap,\r\nfinding pure joy in your body, your heart;\r\nbecause youre the queen of my present and past\r\nI have mastered loves sweet but difficult art.\r\nO vows! O perfumes! O infinite kisses!\r\nCan these be reborn from a gulf we cant sound\r\nas suns reappear, as if heaven misses\r\ntheir light when they sink into seas dark, profound?\r\nO vows! O perfumes! O infinite kisses!\r\n\r\nI have found porn sites and escort services using my Baudelaire translations, so \r\nthe pros seem to like them! \r\n\r\n\r\nLes Bijoux (The Jewels)\r\nby Charles Baudelaire\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMy lover nude and knowing my heart\'s whims\r\nWore nothing more than a few bright-flashing gems;\r\nHer art was saving men despite their sins\r\nShe ruled like harem girls crowned with diadems! \r\n\r\nShe danced for me with a gay but mocking air,\r\nMy world of stone and metal sparking bright;\r\nI discovered in her the rapture of everything fair\r\nNay, an excess of joy where the spirit and flesh unite! \r\n\r\nNaked she lay and offered herself to me,\r\nParting her legs and smiling receptively,\r\nAs gentle and yet profound as the rising sea\r\nTill her surging tide encountered my cliff, abruptly. \r\n\r\nA tigress tamed, her eyes met mine, intent ...\r\nIntent on lust, content to purr and please!\r\nHer breath, both languid and lascivious, lent \r\nAn odd charm to her metamorphoses. \r\n\r\nHer limbs, her loins, her abdomen, her thighs,\r\nOiled alabaster, sinuous as a swan,\r\nWrithed pale before my calm clairvoyant eyes;\r\nLike clustered grapes her breasts and belly shone. \r\n\r\nSkilled in more spells than evil imps can muster,\r\nTo break the peace which had possessed my heart,\r\nShe flashed her crystal rocks hypnotic luster\r\nTill my quietude was shattered, blown apart. \r\n\r\nHer waist awrithe, her breasts enormously \r\nOut-thrust, and yet ... and yet, somehow, still coy ...\r\nAs if stout haunches of Antiope \r\nHad been grafted to a boy ... \r\n\r\nThe room grew dark, the lamp had flickered out.\r\nMute firelight, alone, lit each glowing stud;\r\nEach time the fire sighed, as if in doubt,\r\nIt steeped her pale, rouged flesh in pools of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Communion of Sighs\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\r\n\r\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\r\n\r\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\r\n\r\nfelt more than seen.\r\n\r\nI was eighteen,\r\n\r\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\r\n\r\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\r\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\r\nThere was an instant . . .\r\n\r\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\r\n\r\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\r\n\r\nliquidly our lips met\r\n\r\nfeverish, wet\r\n\r\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\r\n\r\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union . . .\r\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\r\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\r\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\r\nThis is one of my early poems but I cant remember exactly when I wrote it. \r\nDue to the romantic style, I believe it was probably written during my first two \r\nyears in college, making me 18 or 19 at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Receiving of the Flower\r\nexcerpt from a Mayan love poem\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLet us sing overflowing with joy \r\nas we observe the Receiving of the Flower. \r\nThe lovely maidens beam; \r\ntheir hearts leap in their breasts. \r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nBecause they will soon yield their virginity to the men they love!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deflowering\r\nexcerpt from a Mayan love poem\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nYou have arrived at last in the woods \r\nwhere no one can see what you do \r\nat the flower-strewn pool ... \r\nRemove your clothes, \r\nunbraid your hair, \r\nbecome as you were \r\nwhen you first arrived here \r\nnaked and shameless\r\nvirgins, maidens! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tally\r\nby Hafiz\r\nan extremely loose translation by Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nAfter a night of hard drinking and spreading her legs,\r\nMillay hits the dorm, where the Vassar don begs:\r\nPlease act more chastely, more discretely, more seemly!\r\n(His name, lets assume, was, er . . . Percival Queemly.) \r\nExpel me! Expel me!She flashes her eyes.\r\nOh! Please! No! I couldnt! That wouldnt be wise,\r\nfor a great banished Shelley would tarnish my name . . .\r\nEek! My game will be lame if I cant milque your fame! \r\nContinue to live herecarouse as you please!\r\nthe beleaguered don sighs as he sags to his knees.\r\nMillay grinds her crotch half an inch from his nose:\r\nI can live in your hellhole, strange man, I suppose ...\r\nbut the price is your firstborn, whom Ill sacrifice to Moloch.\r\n(Which explains what became of pale Percys son, Enoch.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre You the Thief\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I touch you now,\r\nO sweet lover,\r\nfull of fire,\r\nmelting like ice\r\nin my embrace,\r\nwhen I part the delicate white lace,\r\nbaring pale flesh,\r\nand your face\r\nis so close\r\nthat I breathe your breath\r\nand your hair surrounds me like a wreath ... \r\ntell me now,\r\nO sweet, sweet lover,\r\nin good faith:\r\nare you the thief\r\nwho has stolen my heart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRighteous\r\nby Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\r\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\r\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\r\nand in every virtue that is held most dear\r\nexcept only that you are merciless.\r\n\r\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\r\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\r\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\r\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently\r\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\r\n\r\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\r\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\r\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\r\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again\r\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBurn, Ovid\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nBurn OvidAustin Clarke\r\nSunday School,\r\nFaith Free Will Baptist, 1973:\r\nI sat imaging watery folds\r\nof pale silk encircling her waist.\r\nExplicit sex was the days hot topic\r\n(how breathlessly I imagined hers)\r\nas she taught us the perils of lust\r\nfraught with inhibition.\r\nI found her unaccountably beautiful,\r\nrolling implausible nouns off the edge of her tongue:\r\nadultery, fornication, masturbation, sodomy.\r\nActs made suddenly plausible by the faint blush\r\nof her unrouged cheeks,\r\nby her pale lips \r\naccented only by a slight quiver,\r\na trepidation.\r\nWhat did those lustrous folds foretell\r\nof our uncommon desire?\r\nWhy did she cross and uncross her legs\r\nlovely and long in their taupe sheaths?\r\nWhy did her breasts rise pointedly,\r\nas if indicating a direction?\r\nCome unto me,\r\n(unto me),\r\ntogether, we sang,\r\ncheek to breast,\r\nlips on lips,\r\ndevout, afire,\r\nmy hands\r\nup her skirt,\r\nher pants at her knees:\r\nall night long,\r\nall night long,\r\nin the heavenly choir.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem is set at Faith Christian Academy, which I attended for a year during \r\nthe ninth grade, in 1972-1973. While the poem definitely had its genesis there, \r\nI believe I revised it more than once and didn\'t finish it till 2001, nearly 28 \r\nyears later, according to my notes on the poem. Another poem, Sex 101, was \r\nalso written about my experiences at FCA that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSex 101\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThat day the late spring heat\r\nsteamed through the windows of a Crayola-yellow schoolbus\r\ncrawling its way up the backwards slopes\r\nof Nowheresville, North Carolina ...\r\nWhere we sat exhausted\r\nfrom the days skulldrudgery\r\nand the unexpected waves of muggy,\r\nsummer-like humidity ...\r\nGiggly first graders sat two abreast \r\nbehind senior high students\r\nsprouting their first sparse beards,\r\ntheir implausible bosoms, their stranger affections ...\r\nThe most unlikely coupling\r\nLambert, 18, the only college prospect\r\non the varsity basketball team,\r\nthe proverbial talldarkhandsome\r\nswashbuckling cocksman, grinning ...\r\nBeside him, Wanda, 13,\r\nbespectacled, in her primproper attire\r\nand pigtails, staring up at him,\r\nfawneyed, disbelieving ...\r\nAnd as the bus filled with the improbable musk of her,\r\nas she twitched impaled on his finger\r\nlike a dead frog jarred to life by electrodes,\r\nI knew ...\r\nthat love is a forlorn enterprise,\r\nthat I would never understand it.\r\n\r\nThis companion poem to Burn, Ovid is also set at Faith Christian Academy, in \r\n1972-1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRedolence\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow darkness ponds upon the violet hills;\r\ncicadas sing; the tall elms gently sway;\r\nand night bends near, a deepening shade of gray;\r\nthe bass concerto of a bullfrog fills\r\nwhat silence there once was; globed searchlights play.\r\n\r\nGreen hanging ferns adorn dark window sills,\r\nall drooping fronds, awaiting mornings flares;\r\nmosquitoes whine; the lissome moth again\r\nflits like a veiled oud-dancer, and endures\r\nthe fumblings of nights enervate gray rain.\r\n\r\nAnd now the pact of night is made complete;\r\nthe air is fresh and cool, washed of the grime\r\nof the citys ashen breath; and, for a time,\r\nthe fragrance of her clings, obscure and sweet.\r\n\r\nPublished by The Eclectic Muse and The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\r\n\r\n\r\nDuet, Minor Key\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nWithout the drama of cymbals\r\nor the fanfare and snares of drums,\r\nI present my case\r\nstripped of its fine veneer:\r\nBehold, thy instrument. \r\nPlay, for the night is long.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ancient Egyptian Love Lyric (circa 1085-570 BC)\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nIs there anything sweeter than these hours of love,\r\nwhen were together, and my heart races?\r\nFor what is better than embracing and fondling\r\nwhen you visit me and we surrender to delights?\r\nIf you reach to caress my thigh,\r\nI will offer you my breast also \r\nits soft; it won\'t jab you or thrust you away!\r\nWill you leave me because youre hungry?\r\nAre you ruled by your belly?\r\nWill you leave me because you need something to wear?\r\nI have chests full of fine linen!\r\nWill you leave me because youre thirsty?\r\nHere, suck my breasts! Theyre full to overflowing, and all for you!\r\nI glory in the hours of our embracings;\r\nmy joy is incalculable!\r\nThe thrill of your love spreads through my body\r\nlike honey in water,\r\nlike a drug mixed with spices,\r\nlike wine mingled with water.\r\nOh, that you would speed to see your sister\r\nlike a stallion in heat, like a bull to his heifer!\r\nFor the heavens have granted us love like flames igniting straw,\r\ndesire like the falcons free-falling frenzy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Courtesan\'s Love Lyric\r\nby Veronica Franco\r\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\r\nMy rewards will be commensurate with your gifts\r\nif only you give me the one that lifts\r\nme laughing ...\r\nAnd though it costs you nothing,\r\nstill it is of immense value to me.\r\nYour reward will be\r\nnot just to fly\r\nbut to soar, so high\r\nthat your joys vastly exceed your desires.\r\nAnd my beauty, to which your heart aspires\r\nand which you never tire of praising,\r\nI will employ for the raising\r\nof your spirits. Then, lying sweetly at your side,\r\nI will shower you with all the delights of a bride,\r\nwhich I have more expertly learned.\r\nThen you who so fervently burned\r\nwill at last rest, fully content,\r\nfallen even more deeply in love, spent\r\nat my comfortable bosom.\r\nWhen I am in bed with a man I blossom,\r\nbecoming completely free\r\nwith the man who loves and enjoys me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nOnce when her kisses were fire incarnate\r\nand left in their imprint bright lipstick, and flame,\r\nwhen her breath rose and fell over smoldering dunes,\r\nleaving me listlessly sighing her name ...\r\n\r\nOnce when her breasts were as pale, as beguiling,\r\nas wan rivers of sand shedding heat like a mist,\r\nwhen her words would at times softly, mildly rebuke me\r\nall the while as her lips did more wildly insist ...\r\n\r\nOnce when the thought of her echoed and whispered\r\nthrough vast wastelands of need like a Bedouin chant,\r\nI ached for the touch of her lips with such longing\r\nthat I vowed all my former vows to recant ...\r\n\r\nOnce, only once, something bloomed, of a desiccate seed\r\nthis implausible blossom her wild rains of kisses decreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Goes Around, Comes\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThis is a poem about loss\r\nso why do you toss your dark hair\r\nunaccountably glowing? \r\nHow can you be sure of my heart\r\nwhen its beyond my own knowing? \r\nOr is it loves pheromones you trust,\r\nmy eyes magnetized by your bust\r\nand the mysterious alchemies of lust? \r\nNow I am truly lost!\r\n\r\n\r\nChloe\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThere were skies onyx at night ... moons by day ...\r\nlakes pale as her eyes ... breathless winds\r\nundressing tall elms; ... she would say\r\nthat we loved, but I figured wed sinned.\r\nSoon impatiens too fiery to stay\r\nsagged; the crocus bells drooped, golden-limned;\r\nthings of brightness, rinsed out, ran to gray ...\r\nall the light of that world softly dimmed.\r\nWhere our feet were inclined, we would stray;\r\nthere were paths where dead weeds stood untrimmed,\r\ndistant mountains that loomed in our way,\r\nthunder booming down valleys dark-hymned.\r\nWhat I found, I found lost in her face\r\nwhile yielding all my virtue to her grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet Me Give Her Diamonds\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLet me give her diamonds\r\nfor my heart\'s\r\nsharp edges.\r\n\r\nLet me give her roses\r\nfor my soul\'s\r\nthorn.\r\n\r\nLet me give her solace\r\nfor my words\r\nof treason.\r\n\r\nLet the flowering of love\r\noutlast a winter\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nLet me give her books\r\nfor all my lack\r\nof reason.\r\n\r\nLet me give her candles\r\nfor my lack\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\nLet me kindle incense,\r\nfor our hearts\r\nrequire\r\n\r\nthe breath-fanned\r\nflaming perfume\r\nof desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloating\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nMemories flood the sands unfolding scroll;\r\nthey pour in with the long, cursive tides of night.\r\n\r\nMemories of revenant blue eyes and wild lips\r\nmoist and frantic against my own.\r\n\r\nMemories of ghostly white limbs . . .\r\nof soft sighs\r\nheard once again in the surfs strangled moans.\r\n\r\nWe meet in the scarred, fissured caves of old dreams,\r\ngreen waves of algae billowing about you,\r\nbecoming your hair.\r\n\r\nSuspended there,\r\nwhere pale sunset discolors the sea,\r\nI see all that you are\r\nand all that you have become to me.\r\n\r\nYour love is a sea,\r\nand I am its trawler\r\nharbored in dreams,\r\nI ride out nights storms.\r\n\r\nUnanchored, I drift through the hours before morning,\r\ndreaming the solace of your warm breasts,\r\npondering your riddles, savoring the feel\r\nof the explosions of your hot, saline breath.\r\n\r\nAnd I rise sometimes\r\nfrom the tropical darkness\r\nto gaze once again out over the sea . . .\r\nYou watch in the moonlight\r\nthat brushes the water;\r\n\r\nbright waves throw back your reflection at me.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my more surreal poems, as the sea and lover become one. I believe \r\nI wrote this one at age 19. It has been published by Penny \r\nDreadful, Romantics Quarterly, Boston Poetry Magazine and \r\nPoetry Life  Times. The poem may have had \r\na different title when it was originally published, but it escapes me . . . \r\nah, yes, Entanglements.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevermore!\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNevermore! O, nevermore\r\nshall the haunts of the sea\r\nthe swollen tide pools\r\nand the dark, deserted shore\r\nmark her passing again.\r\n\r\nAnd the salivating sea\r\nshall never kiss her lips\r\nnor caress her breasts and hips\r\nas she dreamt it did before,\r\nonce, lost within the uproar.\r\n\r\nThe waves will never rape her,\r\nnor take her at their leisure;\r\nthe sea gulls shall not have her,\r\nnor could she give them pleasure . . .\r\nShe sleeps forevermore.\r\n\r\nShe sleeps forevermore,\r\na virgin save to me\r\nand her other lover,\r\nwho lurks now, safely smothered\r\nby the restless, surging sea.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, they sleep together,\r\nbut never in that way!\r\nFor the sea has stripped and shorn\r\nthe one I once adored,\r\nand washed her flesh away.\r\n\r\nHe does not stroke her honey hair,\r\nfor she is bald, bald to the bone!\r\nAnd how it fills my heart with glee\r\nto hear them sometimes cursing me\r\nout of the depths of the demon sea . . .\r\n\r\ntheir skeletal loveimpossibility!\r\n\r\nThis is one of my Poe-like creations, written around age 19. I think the \r\npoem has an interesting ending, since the male skeleton is missing an important \r\nmember.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsycho Analysis\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThis is not what I need . . .\r\nanalysis,\r\nparalysis,\r\nas though I were a seed\r\nto be planted,\r\nsupported\r\nwith a stick and some string\r\nuntil I emerge.\r\nYour words\r\nare not water. I need something\r\nmore nourishing,\r\nlike cherishing,\r\nsomething essential, like love\r\nso that when I climb\r\nout of the lime\r\nand the mulch.

Burch\r\nThe secret of her clothes\r\nis that they whisper a little mysteriously\r\nof things unseen \r\nin the language of nylon and cotton,\r\nso that when she walks\r\nto her amorous drawers \r\nto rummage among the embroidered hearts\r\nand rumors of pastel slips\r\nfor a white wisp of Victorian lace, \r\nthe delicate rustle of fabric on fabric,\r\nthe slightest whisper of telltale static,\r\nelectrifies me. \r\nPublished by Erosha, \r\nVelvet Avalanche (Anthology) and\r\nPoetry Life  Times\r\n\r\n\r\nRetro\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nNow, once again,\r\nloves a redundant pleasure,\r\nas we laugh\r\nat my childish fumblings\r\nthrough the acres of your dress,\r\npast your wily-wired brassiere,\r\nthrough your panties pink billows\r\nof thrill-piqued frills ... \r\nTill I lay once againpanting redfaced\r\nat your gayest lack of resistance,\r\nand, later, at your milktongued\r\nmewlings in the dark ... \r\nWhen you were virginal,\r\nsweet as eucalyptus,\r\nwe did not understand\r\nthe miracle of repentance,\r\nand I took for granted\r\nyour obsessive distance ... \r\nBut now I am happily unbuttoning\r\nthat chaste dress,\r\nunhitching that firm-latched bra,\r\ntugging at those parachute-like panties\r\nthe ones you would have gladly forgotten\r\nhad I not bought them in this years size. \r\nOriginally published by  \r\nErosha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep Into Starlight\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nStep into starlight,\r\nlovely and wild,\r\nlonely and longing,\r\na woman, a child . . .\r\nThrow back drawn curtains,\r\nenter the night,\r\ndream of his kiss\r\nas a comet ignites . . .\r\nThen fall to your knees\r\nin a wind-fumbled cloud\r\nand shudder to hear\r\noak hocks groaning aloud.\r\nFlee down the dark path\r\nto where the snaking vine bends\r\nand withers and writhes\r\nas winter descends . . .\r\nAnd learn that each season\r\nends one vanished day,\r\nthat each pregnant moon holds\r\nno spent tides in its sway . . .\r\nFor, as suns seek horizons\r\nboys fall, men decline.\r\nAs the grape sags with its burden,\r\nrememberthe wine!\r\n\r\nI believe I wrote the original version of this poem in my early twenties, circa \r\n1978-1979.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfoldings, for Vicki\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nTime unfolds . . .\r\n\r\nYour lips were roses.\r\n. . . petals open, shyly clustering . . .\r\n\r\nI had dreams\r\nof other seasons.\r\n. . . ten thousand colors quiver, blossoming.\r\nNight and day . . .\r\n\r\nDreams burned within me.\r\n. . . flowers part themselves, and then they close . . .\r\n\r\nYou were lovely;\r\nI was lonely.\r\n. . . a virgin yields herself, but no one knows.\r\nNow time goes on . . .\r\n\r\nI have not seen you.\r\n. . . within ringed whorls, secrets are exchanged . . .\r\n\r\nA fire rages;\r\nno one sees it.\r\n. . . a blossom spreads its flutes to catch the rain.\r\nSeasons flow . . .\r\n\r\nA dream is dying.\r\n. . . within parched clusters, life is taking form . . .\r\n\r\nYou were honest;\r\nI was angry.\r\n. . . petals fling themselves before the storm.\r\nTime is slowing . . .\r\n\r\nI am older.\r\n. . . blossoms wither, closing one last time . . .\r\n\r\nI\'d love to see you\r\nand to touch you.\r\n. . . a flower crumbles, crinklingworn and dry.\r\nTime contracts . . .\r\n\r\nI cannot touch you.\r\n. . . a solitary flower cries for warmth . . .\r\n\r\nLife goes on as\r\ndreams lose meaning.\r\n. . . the seeds are scattered, lost within a storm.\r\n\r\nI wrote this poem for my first college girlfriend. I intensely wanted to be with her \r\nbest friend, who was dating my best friend at the time. When I finally got my \r\nchance with my best friend\'s girlfriend, I was so drunk, I couldn\'t seize the \r\nopportunity. Meanwhile, when my girlfriend was so drunk she offered me the \r\nopportunity I had always wanted, I felt compelled to be a gentleman. So it was \r\nall very strange, as if the Fates had ordained that none of us should end up \r\nbeing together. It was a very sad, confused time . . . a time when longings \r\nthreatened to overwhelm us, and yet a strange sort of honor seemed to win the \r\nday, although none of us really meant to act with honor. Perhaps we were all \r\nsaving ourselves for other people we hadn\'t yet met, or perhaps hormones and \r\nalcohol have completely different agendas . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nThe rose of loves bright promise\r\nlies torn by her own thorn;\r\nher scent was sweet\r\nbut at her feet\r\nthe pallid aphids mourn. \r\nThe lilac of devotion\r\nhas felt the winter hoar\r\nand shed her dress;\r\ncompanionless,\r\nshe shiversnude, forlorn. \r\nPublished by Songs of Innocence, The Aurorean and\r\nContemporary Rhyme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgauses Song\r\nby Michael R.

Burch\r\n\r\nYou were like sunshine and rain\r\nbegetting rainbows,\r\nfull of contradictions, like the intervals\r\nbetween light and shadow.\r\n\r\nThat within you which I most opposed\r\ndrew me closer still,\r\nas a magnet exerts its unyielding pull\r\non insensate steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Is Not Love\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLove is not love that never looked\r\nwithin itself and questioned all,\r\ncurled up like a zygote in a ball,\r\nthrobbed, sobbed and shook.\r\n\r\n(Or went on a binge at a nearby mall,\r\nthen would not cook.)\r\n\r\nLove is not love that never winced,\r\nthen smiled, convinced\r\nthat soars the prerequisite of fall.\r\n\r\nWhen all\r\nits wounds and scars have been saline-rinsed,\r\nwhere does Love find the wherewithal\r\nto try again,\r\nendeavor, when\r\n\r\nall that it knows\r\nis: O, because!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInce St. Child\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nWhen she was a child\r\n\r\nin a dark forest of fear,\r\n\r\nimagination cast its strange light\r\n\r\ninto secret places,\r\n\r\nscattering traces\r\n\r\nof illumination so bright,\r\n\r\nyears later, she could still find them there,\r\ntheir light undefiled.\r\n\r\nWhen she was young,\r\n\r\nthe shafted light of her dreams\r\n\r\nshone on her uplifted face\r\n\r\nas she prayed . . .\r\n\r\nthough she strayed\r\n\r\ninto a night fallen like woven lace\r\n\r\nshrouding the forest of screams,\r\nher faith led her home.\r\n\r\nNow she is old\r\n\r\nand the light that was flame\r\n\r\nis a slow-dying ember . . .\r\n\r\nwhat she felt then\r\n\r\nshe would explain;\r\n\r\nshe would if she could only remember\r\n\r\nthat forest of shame,\r\nfaith beaten like gold.\r\n\r\nThis was an unusual poem, and it took me some time to figure out who the old \r\nwoman was. She was a victim of childhood incest, hence the title I eventually \r\ncame up with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginal\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nFor an hour\r\nevery wildflower\r\nbeseeches her,\r\nTo thy breast,\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nBut she is mine;\r\nher lips divine\r\nand her breasts and hair\r\nare mine alone.\r\n\r\nLet the wildflowers moan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoke\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\nThe hazy, smoke-filled skies of summer I remember well;\r\nfarewell was on my mind, and the thoughts that I can\'t tell\r\nrang bells within (the din was in) my mind, and I can\'t say\r\nif what we had was good or bad, or where it is today.\r\nThe endless days of summer\'s haze I still recall today;\r\nshe spoke and smoky skies stood still as summer slipped away . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem appeared in my high school journal, the Lantern, in 1976. It also appeared in my college literary journal, Homespun, \r\nin 1977. I had The \r\nSummer of \'42 in mind when I wrote it. Ironically, I didn\'t see the movie \r\nuntil many years later, but something about its advertisement touched me. Am I \r\nthe only poet who wrote a love poem for Jennifer O\'Neil after seeing her \r\nfleeting image in a blurb? At least in that respect, I may be unique! In any \r\ncase, the movie came out in 1971 or 1972, so I was probably around 14 when \r\nI wrote the poem. I think it\'s interesting that I was able to write a rhyme \r\nrich poem at such a young age. In six lines the poem has 26 rhymes and near \r\nrhymes: smoke-spoke-smoky, well-farewell-tell-bells-still-recall-still, \r\nsummer-remember-summer-summer, within-din-in, say-today-days-haze-today-away, \r\nhad-good-bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViolets\r\n\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce, only once,\r\nwhen the wind flicked your skirt\r\nto an indiscreet height\r\n\r\nand you laughed,\r\nabruptly demure,\r\noutblushing shocked violets:\r\n\r\nsuddenly,\r\nI knew:\r\neverything had changed\r\n\r\nand as you braided your hair\r\ninto long bluish plaits\r\nthe shadows empurpled,\r\n\r\nthe dragonflies\r\nlast darting feints\r\ndissolving mid-air,\r\n\r\nwe watched the suns long glide\r\ninto evening,\r\nknowing and unknowing.\r\n\r\nO, how the illusions of love\r\nawait us in the commonplace\r\nand rare\r\n\r\nthen haunt our small remainder of hours.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinary Love\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nIndescribableour loveand still we say\r\nwith eyes averted, turning out the light,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way\r\n\r\nand tug the coverlet where once we lay,\r\nall suntanned limbs entangled, shivering, white ...\r\nindescribably in love. Or so we say.\r\n\r\nYour hair\'s blonde thicket now is tangle-gray;\r\nyou turn your back; you murmur to the night,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nBeneath the sheets our hands and feet would stray\r\nto warm ourselves.We do not touch despite\r\na love so indescribable.We say\r\n\r\nwe\'re older now, that love has had its day.\r\nBut that which Love once countenanced, delight,\r\nstill makes you indescribable.I say,\r\nI love you, in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nWinner of the 2001 Algernon Charles Swinburne poetry contest; originally published by Romantics Quarterly \r\nand nominated for the Pushcart Prize\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor All that I Remembered\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nFor all that I remembered, I forgot\r\nher name, her face, the reason that we loved ...\r\nand yet I hold her close within my thought.\r\nI feel the burnished weight of auburn hair\r\nthat fell across her face, the apricot\r\nclean scent of her shampoo, the way she glowed\r\nso palely in the moonlight, angel-wan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memory of her gathers like a flood\r\nand bears me to that night, that only night,\r\nwhen she and I were one, and if I could ...\r\nI\'d reach to her this time and, smiling, brush\r\nthe hair out of her eyes, and hold intact\r\neach feature, each impression. Love is such\r\na threadbare sort of magic, it is gone\r\nbefore we recognize it. I would crush\r\nmy lips to hers to hold their memory,\r\nif not more tightly, less elusively.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon Lake\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nStarlit recorder of summer nights,\r\nwhat magic spell bewitches you?\r\nThey say that all lovers love first in the dark . . .\r\nIs it true?\r\n Is it true?\r\n Is it true?\r\nStarry-eyed seer of all that appears\r\nand all that has appeared\r\nWhat sights have you seen?\r\nWhat dreams have you dreamed?\r\nWhat rhetoric have you heard?\r\n\r\nIs love an oration,\r\nor is it a word?\r\nHave you heard?\r\n Have you heard?\r\n Have you heard?\r\n\r\nI believe I wrote this poem in my late teens. I think the questions are \r\ninteresting. Do all lovers love first in the dark? Is love an oration, or is it \r\na word?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPassionate One\r\nby Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nLove of my life,\r\nlight of my morning\r\narise, brightly dawning,\r\nfor you are my sun.\r\nGive me of heaven\r\nboth manna and leaven\r\ndesirous Presence,\r\nPassionate One.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaughty Limericks\r\n\r\nShotgun Bedding\r\nby Michael R. Burch \r\nA pedestrian pediatrician\r\nset out on a dangerous mission;\r\nthough his child bride, Lolita,\r\nwas a sweet senorita,\r\nher pas shotgun cut off his emissions. \r\n\r\nThere was a lewd whore from Nantucket\r\nwho intended to pee in a bucket;\r\nbut being a man\r\nshe missed the damn can\r\nand her rattled johns fled, crying: Fuck it!\r\nvariation on a classic limerick by Michael R. Burch\r\n\r\nHere are three linked Nantucket limericks of mine:\r\n\r\nThere was a coarse whore of Nantucket \r\nwhose bush needed someone to pluck it \r\ncause it looked like a chimps \r\nand her johns were limp gimps \r\nwho refused to touch, suck it or fuck it. \r\n\r\nSo that coarse, canny whore of Nantucket,\r\nonce muff-shaved, decided to shuck it \r\nthat thick, wiry pelt \r\nthat smelled like wet felt \r\nand made it a toupee for Luckett. \r\n\r\nNow Luckett, once bald as an eagle, \r\nlike Samson stands handsome and regal \r\nwith hair to his ass \r\nthat smells like his lass, \r\nbut still comes when she calls, like a beagle. \r\na triple limerick by Michael R. Burch\r\nThere once was a mockingbird, Clyde,\r\nwho bragged of his prowess, but lied.\r\nTo his new wife he sighed,\r\nWhen again, gentle bride?\r\nNevermore! bright-eyed Raven replied.\r\nMichael R.
