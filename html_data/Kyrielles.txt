But first, what \r\nthe hell is a Kyrielle? The simple answer is that a Kyrielle is a poem with a \r\nrefraina repeating word or line. That makes a Kyrielle \r\nsimilar to a villanelle, one of the more popular English poetic forms. Here are \r\nsome more advanced definitions ...\r\n\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica: A French verse form in short, usually \r\noctosyllabic, rhyming couplets. The couplets are often paired in quatrains and \r\nare characterized by a refrain that is sometimes a single word and sometimes the \r\nfull second line of the couplet or the full fourth line of the quatrain. \r\n\r\nTheOxford English Dictionaryis not kind to the Kyrielle: 1. A long \r\nrigamarole ex. 1653. Urquhart. Rabelais I. XXII.With him he mumbled all his \r\nkirielle and dunsical breborons. 2. A kind of Fr. verse divided into little \r\nequal couplets and ending with the same word which serves for the refrain. ex. \r\n1887 Sat. Rev. 3 Dec. 770/1. Among the verse forms the kyrielle of which we have \r\nthree specimens, is not a form at all, and ought to have been discarded.But \r\nmight this be British discrimination against French poetic forms? \r\n\r\nWhile the kyrielle is not as common as the sonnet or villanelle, it \r\nhas been used to create some very moving, power-packed poems ...\r\n\r\nA very brief history of the kyrielle: The kyrielle is an ancient French poetic form \r\noriginally used by Troubadours in the early Renaissance. It it is related to the\r\nKyrie Eleison (Lord, have mercy), a Christian prayer with a repeated refrain. \r\nThe prayer dates back at least to the sixth century, as it was mentioned by Pope \r\nGregory the Great (540-608). In the Roman Rite liturgy, the variant Christe \r\neleison (Christ, have mercy) is used.The earliest Anglo \r\nSaxon or Old English poem with a refrain may be Wulf and Eadwacer, circa 990. The\r\nKyrie Eleison prayer was being recited in \r\nEnglish by 1549, and it appeared in the Book of Common Prayer published \r\nin 1552, but oral versions could be considerably older. William Dunbar\'s poem \r\nLament for the Makaris (Makers), written circa 1505, bears a strong \r\nresemblance to the Kyrielle, as does the Corpus Christi Carol, which dates to \r\n1504 or earlier. Thomas Nashe wrote a powerful English Kyrielle, A Litany in \r\nTime of Plague no later than 1592 because it appeared in his play Summer\'s \r\nLast Will and Testament, which was published that year. The haunting Lyke-Wake \r\nDirge with its terrifying refrain and Christe receive thy saule (soul) was \r\npublished in 1606, but is believed to be much older. More recently, the phrase can be found in the titles of the John Berryman poem \r\nKyrie Eleison and the Mr. Mister song Kyrie. \r\n\r\nExamples of the Kyrielle and Kyrielle-like poems and songs: Kyrielle by John Payne, \r\nA Litany in Time of Plague by Thomas Nashe, A Lenten Hymn by Thomas Campion, \r\nLament for the Makaris by William Dunbar, Corpus Christi Carol by Anonymous, \r\nLyke-Wake Dirge by Anonymous, La Belle Dame Sans Merci: A Ballad \r\nby John Keats, Oh Don\'t You Wish (Your Dreams Were True) by \r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\ncompiled\r\nby Michael R.
