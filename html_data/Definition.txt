Many experts have attempted definitions of poetry over the \ncenturies, but I am going to propose an uncommon definition based on my \nexperience as a boy when I began exploring poetry independently. I hesitate to \ncall this a new definition, because someone else may have used it before, but \nit is not a definition that I remember running across in my extensive studies of \npoetry over forty years. Here is my definition, which will be followed \nquickly by examples which I believe help prove my case:\n\nPoetry is the magic of words.\n\nIt is important to note that by this definition, most poetry is not really \npoetry because it lacks the essential magic. Most poetry that we see today is really prose \nwith line breaks; the line breaks make the prose look like poetry. But when we \nread the prose, we are unmoved because it lacks the magic that makes \npoetry an art. If I draw stick figures with a crayon, is that art? No, because \nmy stick figures will not take your breath away. A great artist can take your \nbreath away for a moment, because there is magic in his/her art. The ability to \nmove audiencesto make them feel somethingis the test of \nart, and of the true artist.\n\nI am going to expand on my definition before I start presenting examples of what \nI mean:\n\nPoetry is the magic of words: the rightness of the best possible words.\n\nIn the perfect poem, the perfect words appear in the perfect order. But is \nabsolute perfection possible? Perhaps not, but as we are about to see, some \npoets have either achieved perfection, or they have come damn close. \nBut theirs is not an icy crystalline perfection; rather, we can feel a warm \nhuman heart beating in the background ...\n\n\nby\nMichael R. Burch\n\n\n\nRequiescat\nby Oscar Wilde\n\nTread lightly, she is near\nUnder the snow,\nSpeak gently, she can hear\nThe daisies grow.\n\nAll her bright golden hair\nTarnished with rust,\nShe that was young and fair\nFallen to dust.\n\nLily-like, white as snow,\nShe hardly knew\nShe was a woman, so\nSweetly she grew.\n\nCoffin-board, heavy stone,\nLie on her breast,\nI vex my heart alone,\nShe is at rest.\n\nPeace, Peace, she cannot hear\nLyre or sonnet,\nAll my life\'s buried here,\nHeap earth upon it.\n\nHow did you feel when you read the poem above? Did it move you? If so, that is \nwhat I mean when I say that poetry is the magic of words. We can find the same \nmagic in the best song lyrics: Greensleeves, Shenandoah, Danny Boy, \nAngie by the Rolling Stones, Candle in the Wind by Elton John, A Change is \nGonna Come by Sam Cooke, and Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and \nGarfunkel ... just to cite a few quick examples. \n\n\n\nBread and Music\nby Conrad Aiken\nMusic I heard with you was more than music, \nAnd bread I broke with you was more than bread; \nNow that I am without you, all is desolate; \nAll that was once so beautiful is dead. \n\nYour hands once touched this table and this silver, \nAnd I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \nThese things do not remember you, belov\xe8d, \nAnd yet your touch upon them will not pass. \n\nFor it was in my heart you moved among them, \nAnd blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \nAnd in my heart they will remember always,\nThey knew you once, O beautiful and wise.\n\nDid you once again feel the magic of poetrythe rightness of what Samuel Taylor \nColeridge called the best words in the best possible order? \n\n\n\nSappho, fragment 42\nloose translation by \nMichael R. Burch\n\nEros harrows my heart:\nwild winds sweeping desolate mountains,\nuprooting oaks.\n\nThis poem by the ancient Greek lyric poet Sappho comes to us from the dawn of \ntime. Eros symbolizes passionate, sexual love, and is the root of our word \nerotic. Has a passionate romantic relationship ever seemed like a wild, \nunnerving storm to you? A wild ride that left your foundations in tatters? If \nso, perhaps this poem will strike a chord ...\n\n\n\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\nby Mary Elizabeth Frye\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep:\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\nI am the swift uplifting rush\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\nI am the soft starshine at night.\nDo not stand at my grave and cry:\nI am not there; I did not die.\n\nThis consoling elegy had a \nvery mysterious genesis, as it was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye, a \nBaltimore housewife who lacked a formal education, having been orphaned at age \nthree. She had never written poetry before. Frye wrote the poem on a ripped-off piece of a brown grocery bag, \nin a burst of compassion for a Jewish girl who had fled the Holocaust  \nonly to receive news that her mother had died in Germany. The girl was \nweeping inconsolably because she couldn\'t visit her mother\'s grave to share her \ntears of love and bereavement. When the poem was named Britain\'s \nmost popular poem in a 1996 Bookworm poll, with more than 30,000 \ncall-in votes despite not having been one of the critics\' \nnominations, an unlettered orphan girl had seemingly surpassed all England\'s \nmany cultured and degreed ivory towerists in the public\'s estimation. Although the poem\'s \norigin was disputed for some time (it had been attributed to Native American and other sources), \nFrye\'s authorship was confirmed in 1998 after investigative research by Abigail \nVan Buren, the newspaper columnist better known as Dear Abby. The poem has \nalso been called I Am due to its rather biblical repetitions of the phrase. \nFrye never formally published or copyrighted the poem, so we believe it is in \nthe public domain and can be shared, although we recommend that it not be used \nfor commercial purposes, since Frye never tried to profit from it herself. \n\n\n\nThis Living Hand\nby John Keats\n\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\nAnd thou be conscience-calmdsee here it is\nI hold it towards you.\n\nJohn Keats was very ill as a young man and died prematurely. Does this poem make \nyou feel like he is reaching out to you from the grave, as it does me? \n\n\n\nThe Snow Man\nby Wallace Stevens\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\nFull of the same wind\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\nIf I understand Wallace Stevens correctly, at times he questioned why we are \nhere, and if life has any ultimate meaning. Does his poem communicate the \nemptiness of not mattering, of us not really being real to you, as it does to \nme? \n\n\n\nPiano\nby D. H. Lawrence\n\nSoftly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;\nTaking me back down the vista of years, till I see\nA child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings\nAnd pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.\n\nIn spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song\nBetrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong\nTo the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside\nAnd hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.\n\nSo now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor\nWith the great black piano appassionato.  The glamour\nOf childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast\nDown in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.\n\nDoes thinking about the past, and about lost loved ones, sometimes make you want \nto break down and cry? Did D. H. Lawrence make you catch your breath, as he did \nme? \n\n\n\nSong For The Last Act\nby Louise Bogan\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look\nLess at its features than its darkening frame\nWhere quince and melon, yellow as young flame,\nLie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\'s crook.\nBeyond, a garden.  There, in insolent ease\nThe lead and marble figures watch the show\nOf yet another summer loath to go\nAlthough the scythes hang in the apple trees.\n\nNow that I have your face by heart, I look.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read\nIn the black chords upon a dulling page\nMusic that is not meant for music\'s cage,\nWhose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.\nThe staves are shuttled over with a stark\nUnprinted silence.  In a double dream\nI must spell out the storm, the running stream.\nThe beat\'s too swift.  The notes shift in the dark.\n\nNow that I have your voice by heart, I read.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see\nThe wharves with their great ships and architraves;\nThe rigging and the cargo and the slaves\nOn a strange beach under a broken sky.\nO not departure, but a voyage done!\nThe bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps\nIts red rust downward, and the long vine creeps\nBeside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.\n\nNow that I have your heart by heart, I see.\n\nDid Louise Bogan make you see someone you care about in a different light? Even \nthough the notes shift in the dark, do you feel that you somehow know another \nperson nonetheless? This is a poem about the intimacy of a long-term \nrelationship. Do you sometimes see by the heart what the intellect fails to \nfully understand? If so, this poem may contain the kind of magic that I\'ve been \ndiscussing ...\n\n\n\nThe Death of a Toad\nby Richard Wilbur\n\n A toad the power mower caught,\nChewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got\n To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him\n Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade\n Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim,\n Low, and a final glade.\n\n The rare original heartsblood goes,\nSpends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows\n In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies\n As still as if he would return to stone,\n And soundlessly attending, dies\n Toward some deep monotone,\n\n Toward misted and ebullient seas\nAnd cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia\'s emperies.\n Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone\n In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear\n To watch, across the castrate lawn,\n The haggard daylight steer.\n\nHave you ever had compassion, and a sense of empathy, when viewing the struggles \nof a dying animal? Is our ultimate fate any different than that of Richard \nWilbur\'s hobbled and dying toad? \n\n\n\nWulf and Eadwacer (Anonymous Ballad, circa 960 AD)\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nTo my people he\'s prey, a pariah. \nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he shows his face. \nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nWulf\'s on one island; I, on another.\nHis island is fast, surrounded by fens.\nThere are fierce men on this island.\nThey\'ll rip him to shreds if he shows his face. \nIt is otherwise with us.\n\nMy heart hounded Wulf in his wanderings.\nWhenever it rained and I wept\nthe bold warrior came: he took me in his arms.\nFor me, there was pleasure, but its end was painful.\nWulf, O, my Wulf, my ache for you\nhas made me sick; your infrequent visits\nhave left me famished, deprived of real meat.\nDo you hear, Eadwacer? A wolf has borne\nour wretched whelp to the woods.\nOne can easily sever what never was one:\nour song together.\n\n\nThis is one of the oldest poems in the English language: an Anglo-Saxon poem \nfrom the dawn our our language. Do you feel the anguish of the female speaker?\n\n\n\n\nAcquainted With The Night\nby Robert Frost\n\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rainand back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light.\nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street,\nBut not to call me back or say good-by;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky\nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n\n\n\nThose Winter Sundays by Robert Hayden\n\nSundays too my father got up early\nand put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,\nthen with cracked hands that ached\nfrom labor in the weekday weather made\nbanked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.\nI\'d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.\nWhen the rooms were warm, he\'d call,\nand slowly I would rise and dress,\nfearing the chronic angers of that house,\nSpeaking indifferently to him,\nwho had driven out the cold\nand polished my good shoes as well.\nWhat did I know, what did I know\nof love\'s austere and lonely offices?\n\n\n\nDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by\nDylan Thomas\n\n\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n\n\nExcerpts from More Poems\nby A. E. Housman\n\nXIX\n\nThe mill-stream, now that noises cease,\nIs all that does not hold its peace;\nUnder the bridge it murmurs by,\nAnd here are night and hell and I.\n\nWho made the world I cannot tell;\n\'Tis made, and here I am in hell.\nMy hand, though now my knuckles bleed,\nI never soiled with such a deed.\n\nAnd so, no doubt, in time gone by,\nSome have suffered more than I,\nWho only spend the night alone\nAnd strike my fist upon the stone.\n\n\n\nThe Light of Other Days\nby Tom Moore \n\nOft, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\nFond Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me:\nThe smiles, the tears\nOf boyhood\'s years,\nThe words of love then spoken;\nThe eyes that shone,\nNow dimm\'d and gone,\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!\nThus, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me,\nSad Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me.\n\nWhen I remember all\nThe friends, so link\'d together,\nI\'ve seen around me fall\nLike leaves in wintry weather,\nI feel like one\nWho treads alone\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\nWhose lights are fled,\nWhose garlands dead,\nAnd all but he departed!\nThus, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\'s chain has bound me.\nSad Memory brings the light\nOf other days around me.\n\n\n\nNothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost\n\nNature\'s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf\'s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.\n\n\n\nIn My Craft Or Sullen Art by Dylan Thomas\n\nIn my craft or sullen art\nExercised in the still night\nWhen only the moon rages\nAnd the lovers lie abed\nWith all their griefs in their arms,\nI labour by singing light\nNot for ambition or bread\nOr the strut and trade of charms\nOn the ivory stages\nBut for the common wages\nOf their most secret heart.\nNot for the proud man apart\nFrom the raging moon I write\nOn these spindrift pages\nNor for the towering dead\nWith their nightingales and psalms\nBut for the lovers, their arms\nRound the griefs of the ages,\nWho pay no praise or wages\nNor heed my craft or art.\n\n\n\nThe Garden \nby Ezra Pound\n\nLike a skein of loose silk blown against a wall\nShe walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,\nAnd she is dying piece-meal\nof a sort of emotional anemia.\n\n\nAnd round about there is a rabble\nOf the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.\nThey shall inherit the earth. \n\nIn her is the end of breeding.\nHer boredom is exquisite and excessive.\n\nShe would like some one to speak to her,\nAnd is almost afraid that I\nwill commit that indiscretion.\n\n\n\nLullaby\nby W. H. Auden\n\n\nLay your sleeping head, my love,\nHuman on my faithless arm:\nTime and fevers burn away\nIndividual beauty from\nThoughtful children, and the grave\nProves the child ephemeral:\nBut in my arms till break of day\nLet the living creature lie,\nMortal, guilty, but to me\nThe entirely beautiful.\n        \n\nSoul and body have no bounds:\nTo lovers as they lie upon\nHer tolerant enchanted slope\nIn their ordinary swoon,\nGrave the vision Venus sends\nOf supernatural sympathy,\nUniversal love and hope;\nWhile an abstract insight wakes\nAmong the glaciers and the rocks\nThe hermit\'s carnal ecstacy.\n        \n\nCertainty, fidelity\nOn the stroke of midnight pass\nLike vibrations of a bell\nAnd fashionable madmen raise\nTheir pedantic boring cry:\nEvery farthing of the cost.\nAll the dreaded cards foretell.\nShall be paid, but from this night\nNot a whisper, not a thought.\nNot a kiss nor look be lost.\n        \n\n\nBeauty, midnight, vision dies:\nLet the winds of dawn that blow\nSoftly round your dreaming head\nSuch a day of welcome show\nEye and knocking heart may bless,\nFind our mortal world enough;\nNoons of dryness find you fed\nBy the involuntary powers,\nNights of insult let you pass\nWatched by every human love.\n\n\n\nThe Most of It\nby Robert Frost\n\nHe thought he kept the universe alone;\nFor all the voice in answer he could wake\nWas but the mocking echo of his own\nFrom some treehidden cliff across the lake.\nSome morning from the boulderbroken beach\nHe would cry out on life, that what it wants\nIs not its own love back in copy speech,\nBut counterlove, original response.\nAnd nothing ever came of what he cried\nUnless it was the embodiment that crashed\nIn the cliff\'s talus on the other side,\nAnd then in the far distant water splashed,\nBut after a time allowed for it to swim,\nInstead of proving human when it neared\nAnd someone else additional to him,\nAs a great buck it powerfully appeared,\nPushing the crumpled water up ahead,\nAnd landed pouring like a waterfall,\nAnd stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,\nAnd forced the underbrushand that was all.\n\n\n\nIn Memory of W. B. Yeats\nby W. H. Auden\n\nI\n\nHe disappeared in the dead of winter:\nThe brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,\nAnd snow disfigured the public statues;\nThe mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.\nWhat instruments we have agree\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\n\nFar from his illness\nThe wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,\nThe peasant river was untempted by the fashionable \nquays;\nBy mourning tongues\nThe death of the poet was kept from his poems.\n\nBut for him it was his last afternoon as himself,\nAn afternoon of nurses and rumours;\nThe provinces of his body revolted,\nThe squares of his mind were empty,\nSilence invaded the suburbs,\nThe current of his feeling failed; he became his \nadmirers.\n\nNow he is scattered among a hundred cities\nAnd wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,\nTo find his happiness in another kind of wood\nAnd be punished under a foreign code of conscience.\nThe words of a dead man\nAre modified in the guts of the living.\n\nBut in the importance and noise of to-morrow\nWhen the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of \nthe Bourse,\nAnd the poor have the sufferings to which they are \nfairly accustomed,\nAnd each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of \nhis freedom,\nA few thousand will think of this day\nAs one thinks of a day when one did something slightly \nunusual.\n\nWhat instruments we have agree\nThe day of his death was a dark cold day.\n\nII\n\nYou were silly like us; your gift survived it all:\nThe parish of rich women, physical decay,\nYourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.\nNow Ireland has her madness and her weather still,\nFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives\nIn the valley of its making where executives\nWould never want to tamper, flows on south\nFrom ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,\nRaw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,\nA way of happening, a mouth.\n\nIII\n\nEarth, receive an honoured guest:\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest.\nLet the Irish vessel lie\nEmptied of its poetry.\n\nIn the nightmare of the dark\nAll the dogs of Europe bark,\nAnd the living nations wait,\nEach sequestered in its hate;\n\nIntellectual disgrace\nStares from every human face,\nAnd the seas of pity lie\nLocked and frozen in each eye.\n\nFollow, poet, follow right\nTo the bottom of the night,\nWith your unconstraining voice\nStill persuade us to rejoice;\n\nWith the farming of a verse\nMake a vineyard of the curse,\nSing of human unsuccess\nIn a rapture of distress;\n\nIn the deserts of the heart\nLet the healing fountain start,\nIn the prison of his days\nTeach the free man how to praise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey Flee from Me\n\nby\nThomas Wyatt\n\nThey flee from me that sometime did me seek\nWith naked foot stalking in my chamber.\nI have seen them gentle tame and meek\nThat now are wild and do not remember\nThat sometime they put themselves in danger\nTo take bread at my hand; and now they range\nBusily seeking with a continual change.\n\nThanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\nTwenty times better; but once in special,\nIn thin array after a pleasant guise,\nWhen her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\nAnd she me caught in her arms long and small;\nAnd therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\nAnd softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?\n\nIt was no dream, I lay broad waking.\nBut all is turned thorough my gentleness\nInto a strange fashion of forsaking;\nAnd I have leave to go of her goodness\nAnd she also to use newfangleness.\nBut since that I so kindly am served,\nI would fain know what she hath deserved.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts from More Poems\n by A. E. Housman\n\nXXI\n\nThe world goes none the lamer\n  For ought that I can see,\nBecause this cursed trouble\n  Has struck my days and me.\n\nThe stars of heaven are steady,\n  The founded hills remain,\nThough I to earth and darkness\n  Return in blood and pain.\n\nFarewell to all belongings\n  I won or bought or stole;\nFarewell, my lusty carcase,\n  Farewell, my aery soul.\n\nOh worse remains for others\n  And worse to fear had I\nThan here at four-and-twenty\n  To lay me down and die.\n\n\n\n\nWhen You Are Old by William Butler Yeats\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\n\nAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death \n\n\n\nby William Butler Yeats\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\nThose that I guard I do not love;\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\nMy countrymen Kiltartan\'s poor,\nNo likely end could bring them loss\nOr leave them happier than before.\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\nA lonely impulse of delight\nDrove to this tumult in the clouds;\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\nA waste of breath the years behind\nIn balance with this life, this death.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTom O\' Bedlam\'s Song \nanonymous ballad, circa 1620\n\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin\nThat into rags would rend ye,\nThe spirit that stands by the naked man\nIn the Book of Moons, defend ye.\nThat of your five sound senses\nYou never be forsaken,\nNor wander from your selves with Tom\nAbroad to beg your bacon,\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nOf thirty bare years have I\nTwice twenty been enrag\xe8d,\nAnd of forty been three times fifteen\nIn durance soundly cag\xe8d.\nOn the lordly lofts of Bedlam\nWith stubble soft and dainty,\nBrave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,\nWith wholesome hunger plenty,\n And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWith a thought I took for Maudlin,\nAnd a cruse of cockle pottage,\nWith a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,\nI befell into this dotage.\nI slept not since the Conquest,\nTill then I never wak\xe8d,\nTill the roguish boy of love where I lay\nMe found and stript me nak\xe8d.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWhen I short have shorn my sow\'s face\nAnd swigged my horny barrel,\nIn an oaken inn, I pound my skin\nAs a suit of gilt apparel;\nThe moon\'s my constant mistress,\nAnd the lovely owl my marrow;\nThe flaming drake and the night crow make\nMe music to my sorrow.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nThe palsy plagues my pulses\nWhen I prig your pigs or pullen\nYour culvers take, or matchless make\nYour Chanticleer or Sullen.\nWhen I want provant, with Humphry\nI sup, and when benighted,\nI repose in Paul\'s with waking souls,\nYet never am affrighted.\n But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nI know more than Apollo,\nFor oft when he lies sleeping\nI see the stars at mortal wars\nIn the wounded welkin weeping.\nThe moon embrace her shepherd,\nAnd the Queen of Love her warrior,\nWhile the first doth horn the star of morn,\nAnd the next the heavenly Farrier.\n While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nThe Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,\nAre none of Tom\'s comradoes,\nThe punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn\nAnd the roaring boy\'s bravadoes.\nThe meek, the white, the gentle,\nMe handle not nor spare not;\nBut those that cross Tom Rynosseross\nDo what the panther dare not.\n Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\nWith an host of furious fancies,\nWhereof I am commander,\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\nTo the wilderness I wander.\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\nI summoned am to tourney\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\'s end:\nMethinks it is no journey.\n Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,\n Feeding, drink or clothing;\n Come dame or maid, be not afraid,\n Poor Tom will injure nothing.\n\n\n\nForgive, O Lord by Robert

Not me.\n\nThe brisk fond lackey to fetch and carry,\n  The true, sick-hearted slave,\nExpect him not in the just city\n  And free land of the grave.\n\n\n\nWild Asters \nby Sara Teasdale\n\nIn the spring I asked the daisies\n If his words were true,\nAnd the clever, clear-eyed daisies\n Always knew.\n\nNow the fields are brown and barren,\n Bitter autumn blows,\nAnd of all the stupid asters\n Not one knows.\n\n\n\nSong \nby Christina Rossetti\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n Sing no sad songs for me;\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n Nor shady cypress tree:\nBe the green grass above me\n With showers and dewdrops wet;\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n And if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n I shall not feel the rain;\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n Sing on, as if in pain:\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n That doth not rise nor set,\nHaply I may remember,\n And haply may forget.\n\n\n\nThe Listeners \nby Walter De La Mare\n\n\'Is there anybody there?\' said the Traveller,\nKnocking on the moonlit door;\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\nOf the forest\'s ferny floor:\nAnd a bird flew up out of the turret,\nAbove the Traveller\'s head\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\n\'Is there anybody there?\' he said.\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,\nWhere he stood perplexed and still.\nBut only a host of phantom listeners\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\nTo that voice from the world of men:\nStood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\nBy the lonely Traveller\'s call.\nAnd he felt in his heart their strangeness,\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\nWhile his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\n\'Neath the starred and leafy sky;\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\nLouder, and lifted his head:\n\'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\nThat I kept my word,\' he said.\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\nThough every word he spake\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\nFrom the one man left awake:\nAy, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.\n\n\n\n\nDirective by Robert Frost\n\nBack out of all this now too much for us,\nBack in a time made simple by the loss\nOf detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off\nLike graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,\nThere is a house that is no more a house\nUpon a farm that is no more a farm\nAnd in a town that is no more a town.\nThe road there, if you\'ll let a guide direct you\nWho only has at heart your getting lost,\nMay seem as if it should have been a quarry \nGreat monolithic knees the former town\nLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered.\nAnd there\'s a story in a book about it:\nBesides the wear of iron wagon wheels\nThe ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,\nThe chisel work of an enormous Glacier\nThat braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.\nYou must not mind a certain coolness from him\nStill said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.\nNor need you mind the serial ordeal\nOf being watched from forty cellar holes\nAs if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.\nAs for the woods\' excitement over you\nThat sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,\nCharge that to upstart inexperience.\nWhere were they all not twenty years ago?\nThey think too much of having shaded out\nA few old pecker-fretted apple trees.\nMake yourself up a cheering song of how\nSomeone\'s road home from work this once was,\nWho may be just ahead of you on foot\nOr creaking with a buggy load of grain.\nThe height of the adventure is the height\nOf country where two village cultures faded\nInto each other. Both of them are lost.\nAnd if you\'re lost enough to find yourself\nBy now, pull in your ladder road behind you\nAnd put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.\nThen make yourself at home. The only field\nNow left\'s no bigger than a harness gall.\nFirst there\'s the children\'s house of make-believe,\nSome shattered dishes underneath a pine,\nThe playthings in the playhouse of the children.\nWeep for what little things could make them glad.\nThen for the house that is no more a house,\nBut only a belilaced cellar hole,\nNow slowly closing like a dent in dough.\nThis was no playhouse but a house in earnest.\nYour destination and your destiny\'s\nA brook that was the water of the house,\nCold as a spring as yet so near its source,\nToo lofty and original to rage.\n(We know the valley streams that when aroused\nWill leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)\nI have kept hidden in the instep arch\nOf an old cedar at the waterside\nA broken drinking goblet like the Grail\nUnder a spell so the wrong ones can\'t find it,\nSo can\'t get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn\'t.\n(I stole the goblet from the children\'s playhouse.)\nHere are your waters and your watering place.\nDrink and be whole again beyond confusion.\n\n\n\nLuke Havergal\nby Edward Arlington Robinson\n\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere where the vines cling crimson on the wall,\nAnd in the twilight wait for what will come.\nThe leaves will whisper there of her, and some,\nLike flying words, will strike you as they fall;\nBut go, and if you listen, she will call.\nGo to the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nTo rift the fiery night that\'s in your eyes;\nBut there, where western glooms are gathering\nThe dark will end the dark, if anything:\nGod slays Himself with every leaf that flies,\nAnd hell is more than half of paradise.\nNo, there is not a dawn in eastern skies\nIn eastern skies.\n\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this,\nOut of a grave I come to quench the kiss\nThat flames upon your forehead with a glow\nThat blinds you to the way that you must go.\nYes, there is yet one way to where she is,\nBitter, but one that faith may never miss.\nOut of a grave I come to tell you this\nTo tell you this.\n\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal,\nThere are the crimson leaves upon the wall,\nGo, for the winds are tearing them away,\nNor think to riddle the dead words they say,\nNor any more to feel them as they fall;\nBut go, and if you trust her she will call.\nThere is the western gate, Luke Havergal\nLuke Havergal.\n\n    \n\nExcerpts from More Poems\n by A.

For why\n    Will man lament the state he should envy?\n    To have so soon \'scaped world\'s and flesh\'s rage,\n    And, if no other misery, yet age?\n    Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, Here doth lie\n    Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry,\n    For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such\n    As what he loves may never like too much.\n    \n\n\n\nExile\nby Hart Crane\n\nMy hands have not touched pleasure since your hands,\nNo,nor my lips freed laughter since \'farewell\',\nAnd with the day, distance again expands\nVoiceless between us, as an uncoiled shell.\n\nYet love endures, though starving and alone.\nA dove\'s wings cling about my heart each night\nWith surging gentleness, and the blue stone\nSet in the tryst-ring has but worn more bright.\n\n\n\nThe Broken Tower\nby Hart Crane\n\nThe bell-rope that gathers God at dawn\nDispatches me as though I dropped down the knell\nOf a spent day  to wander the cathedral lawn\nFrom pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.\n\nHave you not heard, have you not seen that corps\nOf shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway\nAntiphonal carillons launched before\nThe stars are caught and hived in the sun\'s ray?\n\nThe bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;\nAnd swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave\nMembrane through marrow, my long-scattered score\nOf broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!\n\nOval encyclicals in canyons heaping\nThe impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!\nPagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping \nO terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...\n\nAnd so it was I entered the broken world\nTo trace the visionary company of love, its voice\nAn instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)\nBut not for long to hold each desperate choice.\n\nMy word I poured. But was it cognate, scored\nOf that tribunal monarch of the air\nWhose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word\nIn wounds pledged once to hope  cleft to despair?\n\nThe steep encroachments of my blood left me\nNo answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower\nAs flings the question true?)  or is it she\nWhose sweet mortality stirs latent power? \n\n\nAnd through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes\nMy veins recall and add, revived and sure\nThe angelus of wars my chest evokes:\nWhat I hold healed, original now, and pure ...\n\nAnd builds, within, a tower that is not stone\n(Not stone can jacket heaven)  but slip\nOf pebbles,  visible wings of silence sown\nIn azure circles, widening as they dip\n\nThe matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes\nThat shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...\nThe commodious, tall decorum of that sky\nUnseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.\n\n\n\nExcerpts from More Poems\n\nby A.

Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\'s Nest \n\nby John Clare\n\n\nI found a ball of grass among the hay\nAnd progged it as I passed and went away;\nAnd when I looked I fancied something stirred,\nAnd turned again and hoped to catch the bird \nWhen out an old mouse bolted in the wheats\nWith all her young ones hanging at her teats;\nShe looked so odd and so grotesque to me,\nI ran and wondered what the thing could be,\nAnd pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood;\nThen the mouse hurried from the craking brood.\nThe young ones squeaked, and as I went away\nShe found her nest again among the hay.\nThe water o\'er the pebbles scarce could run\nAnd broad old cesspools glittered in the sun.\n\nOur thanks to Dr. Edward Zuk for suggesting the inclusion of\nthe poem above.\n\n\n\n    \nExcerpts from More Poems\n\nby A.

Yesterday,\nWe had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,\nWe shall have what to do after firing. But today,\nToday we have naming of parts. Japonica\nGlistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,\n And today we have naming of parts.\n\nThis is the lower sling swivel. And this\nIs the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see\nWhen you are given your slings. And this is the piling \nswivel,\nWhich in your case you have not got. The branches\nHold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,\n Which in our case we have not got.\n\nThis is the safety-catch, which is always released\nWith an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let \nme\nSee anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily\nIf you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms\nAre fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see\n Any of them using their finger.\n\nAnd this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this\nIs to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it\nRapidly backwards and forwards: we call this\nEasing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards\nThe early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:\n They call it easing the Spring.\n\nThey call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy\nIf you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,\nAnd the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of \nbalance,\nWhich in our case we have not got; and the \nalmond-blossom\nSilent in all of the gardens and the bees going \nbackwards and forwards,\n For today we have naming of parts.\n\n\n\nMinstrel Man \nby Langston Hughes\n\nBecause my mouth\nIs wide with laughter\nAnd my throat\nIs deep with song,\nYou did not think\nI suffer after\nI\'ve held my pain\nSo long.\n\nBecause my mouth\nIs wide with laughter\nYou do not hear\nMy inner cry:\nBecause my feet\nAre gay with dancing,\nYou do not know\nI die.\n\n\n\nUphill \nby Christina Rossetti\n\nDoes the road wind up-hill all the way?\n Yes, to the very end.\nWill the day\'s journey take the whole long day?\n From morn to night, my friend.\n\nBut is there for the night a resting-place?\n A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\nMay not the darkness hide it from my face?\n You cannot miss that inn.\n\nShall I meet other wayfarers at night?\n Those who have gone before.\nThen must I knock, or call when just in sight?\n They will not keep you standing at that door.\n\nShall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?\n Of labour you shall find the sum.\nWill there be beds for me and all who seek?\n Yea, beds for all who come.\n\n\n\nThe Fitful Alternations Of The Rain \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nThe fitful alternations of the rain,\nWhen the chill wind, languid as with pain\nOf its own heavy moisture, here and there\nDrives through the gray and beamless atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe Garden Of Love \n  by William Blake\n  \n    I laid me down upon a bank,\nWhere Love lay sleeping;\nI heard among the rushes dank\nWeeping, weeping.\n    \nThen I went to the heath and the wild,\nTo the thistles and thorns of the waste;\nAnd they told me how they were beguiled,\nDriven out, and compelled to the chaste.\n    \nI went to the Garden of Love,\nAnd saw what I never had seen;\nA Chapel was built in the midst,\nWhere I used to play on the green.\n    \nAnd the gates of this Chapel were shut\nAnd Thou shalt not, writ over the door;\nSo I turned to the Garden of Love\nThat so many sweet flowers bore.\n    \nAnd I saw it was filled with graves,\nAnd tombstones where flowers should be;\nAnd priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\nAnd binding with briars my joys and desires.\n\n\n\nThe World Is Too Much With Us by William Wordsworth\n\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\nIt moves us not.Great God! I\'d rather be\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreath\xe8d horn.\n\n\n\nThe Solitary by Sara Teasdale\n\nMy heart has grown rich with the passing of years,\n I have less need now than when I was young \nTo share myself with every comer\n Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.\nIt is one to me that they come or go\n If I have myself and the drive of my will,\nAnd strength to climb on a summer night\n And watch the stars swarm over the hill.\nLet them think I love them more than I do,\n Let them think I care, though I go alone;\nIf it lifts their pride, what is it to me\n Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.\n\n\n\nExcerpts from More Poems\nby A.

but no ghost woke.\nEach one whom Life exiled I named and called.\nBut they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,\nAnd never one fared back to me or spoke.\n\nThen peered the indefinite unshapen dawn\nWith vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,\nThe weak-limned hour when sick men\'s sighs are drained.\nAnd while I wondered on their being withdrawn,\nGagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,\nI dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.\n\n\n\nOn His Seventy-Fifth Birthday\nby Walter Savage Landor\n\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\nNature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\nI warmed both hands before the fire of Life;\nIt sinks, and I am ready to depart.\n\n\n\nFirst Fig\nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\n\nMy candle burns at both ends;\nIt will not last the night;\nBut ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\nIt gives a lovely light!\n\n\n\nThe Sick Rose \nby William Blake\n\nO Rose, thou art sick.\nThe invisible worm\nThat flies in the night\nIn the howling storm\n\n\nHas found out thy bed\nOf crimson joy,\nAnd his dark secret love\nDoes thy life destroy.\n\n\n\n\nMusic When Soft Voices Die (To \n) \nby Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMusic, when soft voices die,\nVibrates in the memory\nOdours, when sweet violets sicken,\nLive within the sense they quicken.\n\nRose leaves, when the rose is dead,\nAre heaped for the belov\xe8d\'s bed;\nAnd so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,\nLove itself shall slumber on.\n\n \n\n\nMethought I Saw\nby John Milton\n\nMethought I saw my late espous\xe8d saint\n Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,\n\nWhom Jove\'s great son to her glad husband gave,\n\nRescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.\nMine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint\n\nPurification in the Old Law did save,\n\nAnd such, as yet once more I trust to have\n\nFull sight of her in Heaven without restraint,\nCame vested all in white, pure as her mind.\n Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\n\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\n\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\n I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\n\n\n\nTo Emily Dickinson\nby Hart Crane\n\nYou who desired so muchin vain to ask\nYet fed your hunger like an endless task,\nDared dignify the labor, bless the quest\nAchieved that stillness ultimately best,\n\nBeing, of all, least sought for:  Emily, hear!\nO sweet, dead Silencer, most suddenly clear\nWhen singing that Eternity possessed\nAnd plundered momently in every breast;\n\nTruly no flower yet withers in your hand,\nThe harvest you descried and understand\nNeeds more than wit to gather, love to bind.\nSome reconcilement of remotest mind\n\nLeaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.\nElse tears heap all within one clay-cold hill.\n\n\n\nTo The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time\nby Robert Herrick\n\nGather ye rose-buds while ye may,\n Old Time is still a-flying:\nAnd this same flower that smiles today\n Tomorrow will be dying.\nThe glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\n The higher he\'s a-getting;\nThe sooner will his race be run,\n And nearer he\'s to setting.\nThat age is best which is the first,\n When youth and blood are warmer;\nBut being spent, the worse, and worst\n Times still succeed the former.\nThen be not coy, but use your time,\n And while ye may, go marry:\nFor having lost but once your prime,\n You may for ever tarry.\n\n\n\nVirtue\nby George Herbert\n\nSweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright!\nThe bridal of the earth and sky\nThe dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\nFor thou must die.\n\nSweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\nBids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\nThy root is ever in its grave,\nAnd thou must die.\n\nSweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\nA box where sweets compacted lie,\nMy music shows ye have your closes,\nAnd all must die.\n\nOnly a sweet and virtuous soul,\nLike season\'d timber, never gives;\nBut though the whole world turn to coal,\nThen chiefly lives.\n\n\n\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Steal by William Wordsworth\n\nA slumber did my spirit seal;\n I had no human fears:\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\n The touch of earthly years.\n\nNo motion has she now, no force;\n She neither hears nor sees;\nRolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,\n With rocks, and stones, and trees.\n    \n\n\n\nOne Art \nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nThe art of losing isn\'t hard to master;\nso many things seem filled with the intent\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.\n\nLose something every day.

Who hopes? Who troubles? Let it pass!\nHe sleeps. He sleeps less tremulous, less cold,\nThan we who wake, and waking say Alas!\n\n\n\n\n\nIs My Team Plowing\nby A. E.

Housman\nO thou that from thy mansion\n Through time and place to roam,\nDost send abroad thy children,\n And then dost call them home,\nThat men and tribes and nations\n And all thy hand hath made\nMay shelter them from sunshine\n In thine eternal shade:We now to peace and darkness\n And earth and thee restore\nThy creature that thou madest\n And wilt cast forth no more.\n\n\n\nSpring and Fall, to a Young Child \nby Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\n\nMargaret, are you grieving \nOver Goldengrove unleaving? \nLeaves, like the things of man, you \nWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you? \nAh! as the heart grows older \nIt will come to such sights colder \nBy and by, nor spare a sigh \nThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie; \nAnd yet you will weep and know why. \nNow no matter, child, the name: \nSorrow\'s springs are the same. \nNor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed \nWhat h\xe9art h\xe9ard of, gh\xf3st gu\xe9ssed: \nIt is the blight man was born for, \nIt is Margaret you mourn for. \n\nOur thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\n\n\n\nThe Eagle and the Mole\nby Elinor Wylie\n\nAvoid the reeking herd, \nShun the polluted flock, \nLive like that stoic bird, \nThe eagle of the rock. \n\nThe huddled warmth of crowds \nBegets and fosters hate; \nHe keeps above the clouds \nHis cliff inviolate. \n\nWhen flocks are folded warm, \nAnd herds to shelter run, \nHe sails above the storm, \nHe stares into the sun. \n\nIf in the eagle\'s track \nYour sinews cannot leap, \nAvoid the lathered pack, \nTurn from the steaming sheep. \n\nIf you would keep your soul \nFrom spotted sight or sound, \nLive like the velvet mole: \nGo burrow underground. \n\nAnd there hold intercourse \nWith roots of trees and stones, \nWith rivers at their source, \nAnd disembodied bones.\n\nOur thanks to T. Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\n\n\n\n\nLeda and the Swan \nby William Butler Yeats\n\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\n\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\n\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\n Being so caught up,\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\n\nOur thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\n\n\n\nWhat Lips My Lips Have Kissed \nby Edna St. Vincent Millay\nWhat lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,\nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain\nUnder my head till morning; but the rain\nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh\nUpon the glass and listen for reply,\nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain\nFor unremembered lads that not again\nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.\nThus in winter stands the lonely tree,\nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one,\nYet knows its boughs more silent than before:\nI cannot say what loves have come and gone,\nI only know that summer sang in me\nA little while, that in me sings no more.Our thanks to Michael Bennett for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\n\n\n\nThe Dead Man Walking by Thomas Hardy\n\nThey hail me as one living, \nBut don\'t they know \nThat I have died of late years, \nUntombed although? \n\nI am but a shape that stands here, \nA pulseless mould, \nA pale past picture, screening \nAshes gone cold. \n\nNot at a minute\'s warning, \nNot in a loud hour, \nFor me ceased Time\'s enchantments \nIn hall and bower. \n\nThere was no tragic transit, \nNo catch of breath, \nWhen silent seasons inched me \nOn to this death .... \n\n A Troubadour-youth I rambled \nWith Life for lyre, \nThe beats of being raging \nIn me like fire. \n\nBut when I practised eyeing \nThe goal of men, \nIt iced me, and I perished \nA little then. \n\nWhen passed my friend, my kinsfolk, \nThrough the Last Door, \nAnd left me standing bleakly, \nI died yet more; \n\nAnd when my Love\'s heart kindled \nIn hate of me, \nWherefore I knew not, died I \nOne more degree. \n\nAnd if when I died fully \nI cannot say, \nAnd changed into the corpse-thing \nI am to-day, \n\nYet is it that, though whiling \nThe time somehow \nIn walking, talking, smiling, \nI live not now. \n\nOur thanks to Tom Merrill for suggesting the inclusion of the poem above.\n\n\n\nLa Figlia Che Piange (The Weeping Girl) \nby T. S. Eliot\n\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair \nLean on a garden urn \nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair \nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise \nFling them to the ground and turn\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\n\nSo I would have had him leave,\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\nSo he would have left\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\nI should find\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\nSome way we both should understand,\nSimple and faithless as a smile and a shake of the hand.\n\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\nCompelled my imagination many days,\nMany days and many hours:\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\nThe troubled midnight, and the noon\'s repose.\n\n\n\nThe Poet\'s Testament \nby George Santayana\n\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\nAll to the furrow, none to the grave,\nThe candle\'s out, the spirit\'s vigil spent;\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\n\nI leave you but the sound of many a word\nIn mocking echoes haply overheard,\nI sang to heaven. My exile made me free,\nfrom world to world, from all worlds carried me.\n\nSpared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,\nI paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;\nAll times my present, everywhere my place,\nNor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.\n\nBlow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,\nAnd friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,\nAnd heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings\nAtoms of light and tears for mortal things.\n\nTo trembling harmonies of field and cloud,\nOf flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.\nLet form, let music, let all quickening air\nFulfill in beauty my imperfect prayer.\n\n\n\nOn the Eve of His Execution \nby Chidiock Tichborne\n\nMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\nMy fruit is fallen, yet my leaves are green,\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\nAnd now I live and now my life is done.\n\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\nI looked for life and found it was a shade,\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\n\n\nBuffalo Bill\'s defunct \nby E.

I had not slept for knowing\nHe too, dead, was a stranger in that land\nAnd felt beneath the earth in the winds flowing\nA tightening of roots and would not understand,\nRemembering lake winds in Illinois,\nThat strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand\nListening.\n\nReflects that these enjoy\nTheir countrys gratitude, that deep repose,\nThat peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,\nThat rest, that sleep\n\nAt Ghent the wind rose.\nThere was a smell of rain and a heavy drag\nOf wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows\nOver fresh water when the waves lag\nFoaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:\nI felt him waiting.\n\nIndicates the flag\nWhich (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain\nThis little field these happy, happy dead\nHave made America\n\nIn the ripe grain\nThe wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,\nDragging its heavy body: at Waereghem\nThe wind coiled in the grass above his head:\nWaitinglistening\n\nDedicates to them\nThis earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift\nA Grateful country\n\nUnder the dry grass stem\nThe words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift\nConfused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating\nOf ants under the grass, the minute shift\nAnd tumble of dusty sand separating\nFrom dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,\nTighten, the earth is rigid, waitshe is waiting\n\nAnd suddenly, and all at once, the rain!\n\nThe living scatter, they run into houses, the wind\nIs trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again\nTrampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned\nSpurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,\nSeeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping\nBetween cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:\nThe earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,\nHe rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.\n\n\n\nElegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\nby Thomas Gray\n\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\nThe lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\n\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\n\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree\'s shade,\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\nThe rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\n\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\nThe swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\n\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share,\n\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\nHow bow\'d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\n\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\nThe short and simple annals of the Poor.\n\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\nAwaits alike th\' inevitable hour:\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\n\nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault\nIf Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise,\nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\n\nCan storied urn or animated bust\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\nCan Honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\nOr Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\n\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway\'d,\nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\n\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\nRich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\nChill Penury repress\'d their noble rage,\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\n\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene\nThe dark unfathom\'d caves of ocean bear:\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\n\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\nSome Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\n\nTh\' applause of list\'ning senates to command,\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\nAnd read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\n\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\n\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\nWith incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\n\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\nTheir sober wishes never learn\'d to stray;\nAlong the cool sequester\'d vale of life\nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.\n\nYet e\'en these bones from insult to protect\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck\'d,\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\n\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th\' unletter\'d Muse,\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\n\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\nThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resign\'d,\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\nNor cast one longing lingering look behind?\n\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\nE\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\n\nFor thee, who, mindful of th\' unhonour\'d dead,\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\n\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\nOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn;\n\n\'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\n\n\'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\nOr crazed with care, or cross\'d in hopeless love.\n\n\'One morn I miss\'d him on the custom\'d hill,\nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\n\n\'The next with dirges due in sad array\nSlow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\nGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\'\n\nThe Epitaph\n\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\nAnd Melancholy marked him for her own.\n\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\nHeaven did a recompense as largely send:\nHe gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\nHe gained from Heaven (\'twas all he wish\'d) a friend.\n\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\nThe bosom of his Father and his God.\n\n\n\nChurch Going\nby Philip Larkin\n\nOnce I am sure there\'s nothing going on\nI step inside, letting the door thud shut.\nAnother church: matting, seats, and stone,\nAnd little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut\nFor Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff\nUp at the holy end; the small neat organ;\nAnd a tense, musty, unignorable silence,\nBrewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off\nMy cycle-clips in awkward reverence,\n\nMove forward, run my hand around the font.\nFrom where I stand, the roof looks almost new\nCleaned or restored? Someone would know: I don\'t.\nMounting the lectern, I peruse a few\nHectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce\nHere endeth much more loudly than I\'d meant.\nThe echoes snigger briefly. Back at the door\nI sign the book, donate an Irish sixpence,\nReflect the place was not worth stopping for.\n\nYet stop I did: in fact I often do,\nAnd always end much at a loss like this,\nWondering what to look for; wondering, too,\nWhen churches fall completely out of use\nWhat we shall turn them into, if we shall keep\nA few cathedrals chronically on show,\nTheir parchment, plate, and pyx in locked cases,\nAnd let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.\nShall we avoid them as unlucky places?\n\nOr, after dark, will dubious women come\nTo make their children touch a particular stone;\nPick simples for a cancer; or on some\nAdvised night see walking a dead one?\nPower of some sort or other will go on\nIn games, in riddles, seemingly at random;\nBut superstition, like belief, must die,\nAnd what remains when disbelief has gone?\nGrass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,\n\nA shape less recognizable each week,\nA purpose more obscure. I wonder who\nWill be the last, the very last, to seek\nThis place for what it was; one of the crew\nThat tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were?\nSome ruin-bibber, randy for antique,\nOr Christmas-addict, counting on a whiff\nOf gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh?\nOr will he be my representative,\n\nBored, uninformed, knowing the ghostly silt\nDispersed, yet tending to this cross of ground\nThrough suburb scrub because it held unspilt\nSo long and equably what since is found\nOnly in separation  marriage, and birth,\nAnd death, and thoughts of these  for whom was built\nThis special shell? For, though I\'ve no idea\nWhat this accoutred frowsty barn is worth,\nIt pleases me to stand in silence here;\n\nA serious house on serious earth it is,\nIn whose blent air all our compulsions meet,\nAre recognised, and robed as destinies.\nAnd that much never can be obsolete,\nSince someone will forever be surprising\nA hunger in himself to be more serious,\nAnd gravitating with it to this ground,\nWhich, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,\nIf only that so many dead lie round.\n\n\n\nOde : Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\nby William Wordsworth\n\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\nThe earth, and every common sight,\nTo me did seem\nApparell\'d in celestial light,\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore;\nTurn wheresoe\'er I may,\nBy night or day,\nThe things which I have seen I now can see no more.\n\nThe rainbow comes and goes,\nAnd lovely is the rose;\nThe moon doth with delight\nLook round her when the heavens are bare;\nWaters on a starry night\nAre beautiful and fair;\nThe sunshine is a glorious birth;\nBut yet I know, where\'er I go,\nThat there hath pass\'d away a glory from the earth.\n\nNow, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,\nAnd while the young lambs bound\nAs to the tabor\'s sound,\nTo me alone there came a thought of grief:\nA timely utterance gave that thought relief,\nAnd I again am strong:\nThe cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;\nNo more shall grief of mine the season wrong;\nI hear the echoes through the mountains throng,\n\nThe winds come to me from the fields of sleep,\nAnd all the earth is gay;\nLand and sea\nGive themselves up to jollity,\nAnd with the heart of May\nDoth every beast keep holiday;\nThou Child of Joy,\nShout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!\n\nYe bless\xe8d creatures, I have heard the call\nYe to each other make; I see\nThe heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;\nMy heart is at your festival,\nMy head hath its coronal,\nThe fulness of your bliss, I feelI feel it all.\nO evil day! if I were sullen\nWhile Earth herself is adorning,\nThis sweet May-morning,\nAnd the children are culling\nOn every side,\nIn a thousand valleys far and wide,\nFresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,\nAnd the babe leaps up on his mother\'s arm:\nI hear, I hear, with joy I hear!\nBut there\'s a tree, of many, one,\nA single field which I have look\'d upon,\nBoth of them speak of something that is gone:\nThe pansy at my feet\nDoth the same tale repeat:\nWhither is fled the visionary gleam?\nWhere is it now, the glory and the dream?\n\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\nThe Soul that rises with us, our life\'s Star,\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar:\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\nFrom God, who is our home:\nHeaven lies about us in our infancy!\nShades of the prison-house begin to close\nUpon the growing Boy,\nBut he \nBeholds the light, and whence it flows,\nHe sees it in his joy;\nThe Youth, who daily farther from the east\nMust travel, still is Nature\'s priest,\nAnd by the vision splendid\nIs on his way attended;\nAt length the Man perceives it die away,\nAnd fade into the light of common day.\n\nEarth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;\nYearnings she hath in her own natural kind,\nAnd, even with something of a mother\'s mind,\nAnd no unworthy aim,\nThe homely nurse doth all she can\nTo make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,\nForget the glories he hath known,\nAnd that imperial palace whence he came.\n\nBehold the Child among his new-born blisses,\nA six years\' darling of a pigmy size!\nSee, where \'mid work of his own hand he lies,\nFretted by sallies of his mother\'s kisses,\nWith light upon him from his father\'s eyes!\nSee, at his feet, some little plan or chart,\nSome fragment from his dream of human life,\nShaped by himself with newly-learn\xe8d art;\nA wedding or a festival,\nA mourning or a funeral;\nAnd this hath now his heart,\nAnd unto this he frames his song:\nThen will he fit his tongue\nTo dialogues of business, love, or strife;\nBut it will not be long\nEre this be thrown aside,\nAnd with new joy and pride\nThe little actor cons another part;\nFilling from time to time his \'humorous stage\'\nWith all the Persons, down to palsied Age,\nThat Life brings with her in her equipage;\nAs if his whole vocation\nWere endless imitation.\n\nThou, whose exterior semblance doth belie\nThy soul\'s immensity;\nThou best philosopher, who yet dost keep\nThy heritage, thou eye among the blind,\nThat, deaf and silent, read\'st the eternal deep,\nHaunted for ever by the eternal mind,\nMighty prophet! Seer blest!\nOn whom those truths do rest,\nWhich we are toiling all our lives to find,\nIn darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;\nThou, over whom thy Immortality\nBroods like the Day, a master o\'er a slave,\nA presence which is not to be put by;\nTo whom the grave\nIs but a lonely bed without the sense or sight\nOf day or the warm light,\nA place of thought where we in waiting lie;\nThou little Child, yet glorious in the might\nOf heaven-born freedom on thy being\'s height,\nWhy with such earnest pains dost thou provoke\nThe years to bring the inevitable yoke,\nThus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?\nFull soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,\nAnd custom lie upon thee with a weight,\nHeavy as frost, and deep almost as life!\n\nO joy! that in our embers\nIs something that doth live,\nThat nature yet remembers\nWhat was so fugitive!\nThe thought of our past years in me doth breed\nPerpetual benediction: not indeed\nFor that which is most worthy to be blest\nDelight and liberty, the simple creed\nOf childhood, whether busy or at rest,\nWith new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:\nNot for these I raise\nThe song of thanks and praise;\nBut for those obstinate questionings\nOf sense and outward things,\nFallings from us, vanishings;\nBlank misgivings of a Creature\nMoving about in worlds not realized,\nHigh instincts before which our mortal Nature\nDid tremble like a guilty thing surprised:\nBut for those first affections,\nThose shadowy recollections,\nWhich, be they what they may,\nAre yet the fountain-light of all our day,\nAre yet a master-light of all our seeing;\nUphold us, cherish, and have power to make\nOur noisy years seem moments in the being\nOf the eternal Silence: truths that wake,\nTo perish never:\nWhich neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,\nNor Man nor Boy,\nNor all that is at enmity with joy,\nCan utterly abolish or destroy!\nHence in a season of calm weather\nThough inland far we be,\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\nWhich brought us hither,\nCan in a moment travel thither,\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\n\nThen sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!\nAnd let the young lambs bound\nAs to the tabor\'s sound!\nWe in thought will join your throng,\nYe that pipe and ye that play,\nYe that through your hearts to-day\nFeel the gladness of the May!\nWhat though the radiance which was once so bright\nBe now for ever taken from my sight,\nThough nothing can bring back the hour\nOf splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\nWe will grieve not, rather find\nStrength in what remains behind;\nIn the primal sympathy\nWhich having been must ever be;\nIn the soothing thoughts that spring\nOut of human suffering;\nIn the faith that looks through death,\nIn years that bring the philosophic mind.\n\nAnd O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,\nForebode not any severing of our loves!\nYet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;\nI only have relinquish\'d one delight\nTo live beneath your more habitual sway.\nI love the brooks which down their channels fret,\nEven more than when I tripp\'d lightly as they;\nThe innocent brightness of a new-born Day\nIs lovely yet;\nThe clouds that gather round the setting sun\nDo take a sober colouring from an eye\nThat hath kept watch o\'er man\'s mortality;\nAnother race hath been, and other palms are won.\nThanks to the human heart by which we live,\nThanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,\nTo me the meanest flower that blows can give\nThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\n\nRelated pages: The Best Vampire Poetry,\nThe Best Dark Poetry,\nThe Best Dark Christmas Poems,\nThe Best Halloween Poetry,\nThe Best Supernatural Poetry,\n\nThe Best Elegies, Dirges  Laments,\nThe Best Poems about Death and Loss\n\nThe HyperTexts\n\n\n\nvar gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
